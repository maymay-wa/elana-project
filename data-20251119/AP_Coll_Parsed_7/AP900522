alexander dubcek ousted from power by the soviet 
22 years ago in czechoslovakia on monday said lithuanians should 
negotiate their independence with moscow and that neither side 
should provoke the use of force 
dubcek one of three senior officials in the czechoslovak 
government ended a fourday official visit his first since 1968 
with a meeting with president mikhail s gorbachev 
he told a news conference that time and patience were needed to 
resolve the impasse between the kremlin and the breakaway baltic 
republic which declared independence march 11 
dubcek said the lithuanian declaration was something that 
happened in such a way that solution is not possible today but 
will be possible tomorrow 
although every nation has the right to selfdeterminaion he 
said lithuania and the soviet union should look for optimum 
solutions and compromise to settle the issue and arrive at a 
transition period during which emotions die down 
both sides dubcek aid should not lose patience and avoid 
any possible conflict 
as leader of the czechoslovak communist party he led the 
prague spring movement in 1968 and ran afoul of the soviet 
hardliners who ordered warsaw pact forces to invade on aug 21 that 
year 
tass quoted gorbachev as discussing the invasion with dubcek 
that action had a negative effect on the development of the 
soviet union itself led to a freeze of planned reforms and slowed 
down the natural development of progressive processes and pushed 
the country to the blind alleys of stagnation gorbachev said

fast food is getting faster with a computerized 
device introduced monday that turns customers into order takers 
isnt rude and like regular clerks even asks if they wouldnt 
like a soda with their fries 
the 8470 computer would give customers more control over 
their orders and increased employee efficiency amid a troubling 
labor shortage said officials at ibm which developed the product 
and a fastfood chain that recently began using it 
if a customer orders a sandwich and salad for example but no 
soft drink the screen illuminates a printed message saying 
would you like a refreshing soda 
as the customer places the order it appears on similar screens 
in the kitchen area eliminating the need for clerks to shout or 
walk orders back to the cooks 
the system is designed for one clerk to handle two terminals for 
two lines of customers 
bilingual versions are also available ibm officials said in 
unveiling the system at the national restaurant associations 
international trade show 
we think its fantastic said mark eagleton vice president 
of a branch of the bailey co which manages about 60 arbys roast 
beef restaurants in five states bailey based in lakewood colo 
is an independent arbys franchisee and has installed eight of the 
devices in its stores 
eagleton said the system has improved service times by about 
20 seconds per order its improved the accuracy of the orders 
its increased our capacity for sales by allowing us to serve more 
customers with the same amount of employees 
and he said customers buy more 
weve seen our average check go up between 9 cents and 40 
cents an order per store he said 
arbys is ibms first client with about 20 restaurants around 
the country using the device eagleton says its being used in 
eight of his arbys and will be installed in all new or remodeled 
arbys managed by his company 
ibm also introduced a notebooksized radiocontrolled order 
board for use by clerks at driveins the clerk intercepts 
customers before they reach the pickup window and punches in the 
order it then appears on a screen in the kitchen and is ready by 
the time the driver arrives at the window 
its being used in about 30 wendys hamburger restaurants 
nationwide but also could be used in sitdown restaurants said ibm 
spokeswoman cindy beck 
the devices come as the industry faces a shrinking work force 
eagleton said 
were having a shortage of workers thoughout the 90s and if 
we can automate more so that whatever workers we do have can be 
used more effectively its going to have a substantial impact 
he said

from africa to latin america to eastern 
europe moscows domain is crumbling 
soviet troops have left afghanistan the marxist regime in 
nicaragua is history ethiopia and mozambique are veering from 
their rigid prosoviet ideologies 
not to mention the disintegration of the iron curtain 
the speed of it all has taken mikhail s gorbachev by surprise 
and dramatically altered his stance as he heads into next weeks 
washington summit meetings with president bush 
soviet leaders and american presidents have met since nikolai 
bulganin and dwight eisenhower gathered with the leaders of britain 
and france in 1955 10 years after josef stalin won territorial 
concessions at yalta that some said helped tighten the soviet grip 
in eastern europe 
for decades after bulganin and eisenhower met in geneva moscow 
widened its circle of influence becoming to ronald reagan in 
1983 the evil empire 
how quickly things change in less than a year 
poland and hungary have held free elections resoundingly 
defeating candidates who represented the status quo 
czechoslovakias parliament elected dissident playwright 
vaclav havel as president replacing communist gustav husak 
bulgarias head of state todor zhivkov resigned 
nicolae ceausescu was executed in romania 
east germany dissolved its communist government and opened the 
berlin wall it is headed toward reunification with west germany 
within the soviet union gorbachevs power is threatened by 
ethnic and economic nationalists 
he has been jeered by crowds in red square he has been 
criticized within the communist party for being too fast or too 
slow in remaking the soviet political and economic systems he has 
dispatched troops to quell ethnic violence 
he has beseeched lithuania unsuccessfully not to declare 
itself independent he is trying to cajole two other baltic 
republics latvia and estonia not to follow the lithuanians 
gorbachev has applied increasing economic pressure to lithuania 
to rescind its declaration and president bush has said the standoff 
between moscow and the baltic republics certainly puts some 
tension on the summit 
in all gorbachev will go into the summit with less of a power 
base than any of his postwar predecessors 
it puts gorbachev in a weakened position in which he basically 
has to in effect ask the west for its indulgence as he tries to 
ride out the crises said michael j sodaro a george washington 
university political scientist and an expert on east germany 
on the other hand sodaro added it puts the west in a 
position in which we dont really want to take excessive advantage 
of gorbachevs internal problems for fear that there might be a 
conservative backlash and gorbachev would be deposed he recognizes 
that the west has an interest in his continuation in power 
observers said they are sure that gorbachev in introducing 
relative freedom of expression and political action to the soviet 
domain did not anticipate the results 
he came to power dealing with not only the problems left to 
him by a communist regime that has failed but by russian history 
said arthur a hartman us amassador to moscow from 1981 to 1987 
i cant believe he didnt know he would have to deal with those 
problems on the other hand i dont think he predicted exactly the 
way things have gone 
janusz bugajski an eastern european specialist at the center 
for strategic and international studies said i dont think 
there was any preplanning for what happened in eastern europe 
there was no blueprint i think what happened was that gorbachev 
became educated during the late 80s as far as the likelihood of 
some major revolution 
sodaro said i think even the most farsighted advisers to 
gorbachev were stunned by the rapidity of the dissolution of 
communism in eastern europe and east germany 
the suddenness of those events he added is affecting the 
attitude of kremlin leaders toward developments in the baltic 
i dont think they want as rapid a disintegration of the 
remaining part of the empire sodaro said 
i think gorbachev from the outset wanted to purge the soviet 
system from the vestiges of stalinism and certainly the 
acquisition of the baltic states can be chalked up to stalin 
said sodaro i think in the back of his mind he and his advisers 
would have to expect this would happen but i dont really think 
that he intended from the outset to preside over the disintegration 
of the soviet empire

on this island where fantasy has long 
dictated policy reality is taking hold and may help improve 
relations with china and stimulate democratic change at home 
the myth has long been that the ruling nationalist party which 
retreated to taiwan after losing a civil war to communist forces in 
1949 is still the legitimate government of china 
that myth has long been used to justify the partys policy of no 
official contact with the rival government in beijing it also has 
long been used to justify the partys monopoly on political power 
but events of the past week culminating in the inaugural 
address of president lee tenghui on sunday indicate the days of 
fantasy are drawing to a close 
lee was sworn in for a sixyear term after being elected by the 
electoral college and stressed his commitment to democracy 
the nationalist government still calls itself the republic of 
china and says reunification with the chinese mainland is the 
ultimate goal 
but on wednesday hau said something no top official had 
previously acknowledged in public the reality is that china today 
is one country with two governments 
in his inauguration speech lee urged markedly improved 
relations with beijing and channels of communication that could 
eventually lead to talks on reunification 
in effect lee signaled a desire to end the 40yearold 
hardline policy toward the chinese communists known as the three 
nos no official contact no negotiations and no compromise 
there is a catch the nationalists want beijing to renounce the 
threat of force against taiwan end its policy of isolating taiwan 
diplomatically and scrap oneparty communist rule 
china on monday rejected such preconditions saying lee was 
ignoring the universally accepted fact that the peoples republic 
of china is the sole legitimate government representing all chinese 
people 
while taiwan does not expect an immediate breakthrough its 
leaders hope relations will improve as civilian and business 
contacts expand indirect trade across the taiwan straits was 4 
billion last year and taiwan residents made 1 million visits to 
the chinese mainland since such travel was first allowed in late 
1987 
we want gradually to expand our contact by peaceful ways 
government spokesman shaw yuming recently told foreign 
journalists we have to move in measured steps its not a 
very actionpacked kind of approach 
lee also said he wanted to quickly scrap the 1947 mobilization 
for the supression of the communist rebellion 
not only would this mean taiwan would no longer view the beijing 
government as a rebel group but it would also lift temporary legal 
provisions that have guaranteed the nationalist party a lock on 
power 
under the provisions the legislature and electoral college are 
dominated by nationalists elected on mainland china before the 
civil war defeat the theory is they cannot be replaced until their 
constituencies are recaptured and new elections held 
but the mainlandelected parliamentarians are dying fast and the 
islands 20 million people 85 percent of whom are native 
taiwanese want a greater say in government 
lee on sunday gave a twoyear timetable for replacing the 
provisions with constitutional amendments that would establish a 
great model of political democracy for all times 
he also stressed the importance of securing fair competition 
among political parties indicating an understanding that future 
legitimacy must come from the people 
still the promise of greater democracy is viewed skeptically by 
many students and opposition party members they view lees 
decision to nominate the countrys only fourstar general as 
premier a step back toward the nationalists authoritarian past 
but the nomination of defense minister hau peitsun also is 
viewed less sinisterly as an attempt by lee to shore up his support 
among party elders and to crack down on rampant corruption and 
crime 
government spokesman shaw said military rule or a return to 
authoritanism would be impossible 
nobody in this land no party no group no individuals 
can turn the clock back he said military rule military 
dictatorship or even authoritariantype of politics cannot be 
accepted by our people

peter yarrow of peter paul and mary says the 
folk groups singalong puff the magic dragon has two meanings 
and neither is about drugs as once rumored 
its ostensibly a song about the moment of loss of innocence 
when that moment occurs it is sad indeed the singer told 300 
augsburg college graduates but its about something else it is 
about the loss of our ideals 
in his commencement speech sunday yarrow spliced folk songs 
with comments on the need for global thinking and the power of the 
individual to bring about change 
yarrow is affiliated with the colleges center for global 
education which arranges for educational travel to the third world 
if you want to we can make history together he said if 
you acknowledge there is suffering think globally act globally 
if there is a single lesson from the 60s it is the belief in our 
own capacities as individuals we all matter

rainwater funneling into salty 
galveston bay from the flooded trinity river is muddying the 
outlook for the texas oyster industry 
in louisiana and five other texas bays on the gulf of mexico 
the crop is expected to be good and retail prices could drop from 
the current level of 450 to 5 a pound said ben nelson an 
oyster harvester and exporter 
but he said 90 percent of the crop in galveston bay will be 
killed 100 percent if the fresh water runs into the bay through 
july 
there will be little to none said sisterinlaw doris 
nelson who with her husband operates three boats on the bay and 
ships oysters as far as the east coast it was already kind of 
bleak and were just struggling to come back from last years 
flood now it looks like this year is going to be taken away too 
officials are expecting large releases of fresh water to 
continue down the trinity well into the summer as the torrential 
rains of several weeks ago more than 200 miles to the north 
continue to drain into galveston bay 
the high waters that have inundated thousands of acres of 
cropland and displaced hundreds of residents now threaten the 
livelihoods of the oyster harvesters 
they have lots to fear based on the amount of water thats 
projected to come said sammy ray former professor of marine 
biology at texas aampm university in galveston with this coming 
down probably a large number of oysters will be lost when the 
water warms up and when they open they lose whatever body salt 
content they have 
and when they get completely fresh they blow up like a 
balloon theyre dead 
last year hurricanes and a tropical storm dumped fresh water 
into the bay and ruined last years oyster crop 
my guesstimate is that its pretty much going to wipe out the 
oyster harvest this year said gil moody marketing specialist 
with the texas department of agriculture in the short term its 
a disaster for fishermen there are 560 oyster dredges that work 
galveston bay and it pretty much puts them out of business 
compared with the 600 million shrimp business in texas the 
oyster industry is small 
but 12 million is not to be laughed at said ce bryan 
regional director of the state department of parks and wildlife 
its the livelihood of 1100 people 
the news is not all bleak if there is no serious flooding next 
year fresh water kills oyster predators like crabs eels 
starfish stingrays snails and fungus that thrive in highly salty 
water 
the oyster population could come back and quite often they 
have bumper crops three or four years following ray said

the last time new mexico tinkered with its 
election system democrat bruce king in 1970 became the states 
first governor in more than 50 years to be elected to a fouryear 
term 
twenty years later new mexico again has changed the rules and 
king is among eight candidates hoping to become the states first 
governor to be eligible to serve two consecutive fouryear terms 
the chance to serve eight straight years has attracted four 
democrats and four republicans to the june 5 gubernatorial 
primaries the largest field in 16 years republican gov garrey 
carruthers was not eligible to run 
i thought it would be a real opportunity to have an agenda and 
get something accomplished because youd be the first governor in 
a long long time not to be a lame duck said democratic hopeful 
paul bardacke an albuquerque lawyer one fouryear term has been 
very bad for this state because we havent developed any 
continuity in government 
new mexicos governors were limited to two consecutive twoyear 
terms until 1970 for the next 20 years they were elected to 
fouryear terms but incumbents could not seek reelection 
this years democratic primary has been largely a battle between 
bardacke and king a 66yearold rancher and businessman who offers 
voters the experience he gained in eight years as governor 
four gop contenders meanwhile are hoping to become the first 
republican governor to succeed a gop incumbent since 1920 
king who served longer than anyone else in the states history 
was elected to his first fouryear term in 1970 and to his second 
in 1978 
in the democratic field king led bardacke in the most recent 
albuquerque journal poll by roughly 48 percent to 25 percent but 
pollster brian sanderoff said the primarys outcome still could 
hinge on undecided democrats who are unlikely to vote for king 
bardacke 45 a former attorney general is urging democrats to 
seek new ideas and choose the future he has attacked kings 
record accusing him of cronyism citing financial problems and 
questioning his ability to muster fresh ideas with a staff largely 
recycled from his 197982 term 
king responded with a flurry of position papers outlining 
farreaching programs in areas such as education the environment 
and crime but bardacke has questioned how king would pay for 
scores of new initiatives 
king says state revenues have nearly doubled since he was last 
governor to almost 2 billion this year and that what they need 
is someone to manage the amounts of money they have 
the two other democrats are former supreme court chief justice 
tony scarborough and lobbyist and former state economic development 
chief bob gold 
the two top gop contenders are frank bond a former state 
legislator and former chairman of the commission on higher 
education and les houston the state senate republican leader 
the journals may poll showed the gop race to be a virtual dead 
heat between the two with each drawing about onefourth of the 
republican support and 40 percent undecided 
bond 46 has drawn much of incumbent carruthers party support 
he figures none of the other three republicans candidates all from 
albuquerque will claim a majority of that citys gop vote which 
accounts for nearly 40 percent of the states republicans 
houston who was a democrat until 1986 has formed a 
conservative coalition in the senate and is counting on 
conservative democrats to help him win in november 
also running in the gop primary is former albuquerque mayor 
harry kinney who has campaigned on a plan to establish 
megalandfills for the nations solid waste the other republican 
candidate is state sen james a caudell who cosponsored the 1986 
twoterm amendment in the legislature

the nations top economic forecasters who 
just a year ago were predicting a recession this year now say the 
economy will avoid a decline through 1991 and set a new record for 
business expansion 
the latest survey of 68 professional forecasters by the national 
association of business economists found 82 percent saying the 
economy would continue to advance slowly through the end of next 
year 
that reversed the findings of a similar poll last may that found 
63 percent of the economists believing a recession would occur this 
year ninetysix percent of those polled for the current survey now 
rule that out 
if growth continues through 1991 the expansion will have lasted 
109 months topping the previous record when the economy grew 106 
months during the vietnam war years from february 1961 to december 
1969 
the current expansion began 90 months ago in november 1982 at 
the end of the last recession 
the survey was conducted in april and may 
but despite seeing no recession the forecasters do not foresee 
strong economic growth either 
the outlook for 1990 is for slower economic growth than in 
1989 when the economy advanced 30 percent the survey found 
weaker increases in real consumption and business spending on 
plant and equipment combine with a smaller improvement in the trade 
deficit to cause much of the slowdown 
the economists also predict unemployment to rise from 52 
percent in 1989 to 54 percent this year automobile sales will 
fall from 99 million last year to 96 million this year housing 
starts will remain unchanged at 139 million 
overall the forecasters said the economy as measured by the 
gross national product would grow 20 percent this year and 24 
percent in 1991 the gnp is the total output of goods and services 
at the same time the forecasters said inflation which rose 81 
percent in the first quarter reflecting in part weatherrelated 
jumps in food and energy prices will drop to an annual rate of 37 
percent in the final nine months of the year that would make the 
1990 inflation rate 47 percent down from 48 percent in 1989 
on the twin deficits the economists said trade would fall from 
a 53 billion imbalance in 1989 to 44 billion this year while the 
federal budget gap would continue to widen 
the economists forecast a budget shortfall of 154 billion in 
the fiscal year ending sept 30 and 135 billion in fiscal 1991 
the grammrudman balanced budget law sets deficit targets of 
100 billion this year and 64 billion in 1991 the actual deficit 
for fiscal 1989 was 152 billion 
interest rates which are blamed for the current economic 
sluggishness are projected to remain near their current levels 
this year before declining slightly in 1991 the forecasters said 
rates for 90day treasury bills will edge down from 79 percent 
in june 1990 to 78 percent at years end and 77 percent by the 
end of 1991 they predicted rates for 30year treasury bonds will 
fall from 87 percent next month to 86 percent in december and 84 
percent at the end of 1991

the united states says the lack of a middle 
east peace process played a role in the violence that flared in 
israel after an allegedly deranged israeli gunman killed seven 
palestinian workers 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher deplored the 
initial killings as a horrible senseless act of a madman 
but he was critical of the force with which the israeli army 
cracked down on subsequent arab rioting leaving an additional 10 
palestinians dead and at least 94 wounded 
we see that as another sign that there must be a peace 
process boucher told reporters 
in the absence of a peace process the potential for this kind 
of senseless violence and spiraling responses afterwards goes up 
he said 
we regret the violence that occurred after this incident 
boucher said and added 
were disturbed by the number of casualties inflicted by the 
israeli army 
the bush administration has been striving for months to get 
talks underway in cairo between israel and representatives of 
palestinian arabs 
but israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir objecting to some of 
the provisions refused to endorse the plan 
the israeli government collapsed in the midst of the controversy 
and neither shamir nor labor party leader shimon peres has been 
able to form a new government 
the suspect in the slayings ami popper appeared in israeli 
court on monday and was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation 
police said popper was suicidal after breaking up with his 
girlfriend 
although boucher was critical of the apparent lack of restraint 
displayed by israeli forces he commended the actions of jordanian 
authorities responding to the shooting of french tourists an 
incident apparently triggered by the israeli slayings 
eight french tourists and a jordanian bystander were wounded in 
the attack 
jordanian police acted quickly to protect foreign tourists and 
to contain protest demonstrations at a palestinian refugee camp 
boucher said 
i think these were valuable steps he said

parents would have to get small children their 
own airline seats and use approved restraints rather than carry 
them free on their laps under a recommendation being considered 
today by the national transportation safety board 
whether all seats must be paid for would be up to airlines 
which have indicated they would still give available seats to 
children under 2 years old but a family traveling to see grandma 
and grandpa might not want to take the chance that a free seat will 
be there when they board 
the ntsb scheduled a vote on the recommendation today even if 
approved by the safety board the proposal would have to clear the 
federal aviation administration before going into effect 
the faa has questioned the safety benefits of mandatory infant 
seats and proposes only to require that airlines allow their use 
when a passenger provides one the agency has said however it 
would consider proposals for a stricter rule 
the airline industrys air transport association reversed its 
earlier opposition to mandatory seats in february petitioning the 
faa for a federal rule requiring them 
the independent safety boards recommendation also adds to 
support by consumer safety groups flight attendants and others for 
increased protection of children aboard commercial airliners 
some travel agents oppose the measure saying it would add to 
the cost of flying for young families and possibly force them to 
travel by automobile on shorter routes they say automobile travel 
poses greater risks per mile than flying 
most carriers already allow infant seats to be used giving the 
child free passage if an empty seat is available for strapping in 
the restraint but when there are no empty seats babies may still 
be boarded without an assigned seat 
under a rule making infant seats mandatory no child of any age 
would be allowed on the plane without an assigned seat 
faa officials have said they are concerned about the burden a 
mandatory rule would put on travelers when the number of children 
killed in airplane crashes is low 
a harvard medical school statistical study in the early 1980s 
theorized that three infants might be saved over five years if all 
children used safety seats on airliners estimates of the number of 
infants flying range from 5000 to 10000 a day 
we dont think there is any safety justification for either 
requiring the airlines to give up a seat for free or for requiring 
a parent to purchase a seat if they dont want to said faa 
spokesman fred farrar in february 
concern over infant safety aboard airliners increased with the 
death of 23monthold evan tsao in the july 19 crash of united 
flight 232 in an iowa corn field 
the boys mother sylvia tsao was among survivors of the crash 
that killed 112 people proponents of the seat rule say the boy 
who died of smoke inhalation might have lived if he had been 
strapped in next to his mother

tailormade antibodies can dramatically 
reverse spreading melanoma the deadliest form of skin cancer when 
injected directly into the tumors researchers say 
the work though still in its preliminary stages suggests that 
it may be possible to stop the disease by harnessing the bodys own 
builtin defenses 
antibodies are among the bodys principal weapons for fighting 
off a variety of foreign invaders including cancer in this case 
scientists crafted human antibodies in the test tube that were 
specifically targeted against the cancer then they injected them 
into cancerous growths on victims skin 
the lesions dry up and regress said dr donald morton 
director of the john wayne surgical oncology clinic at the 
university of california los angeles 
in initial studies morton and colleagues gave the injections to 
28 people whose melanoma came back after initial surgery in 18 of 
them the shots caused partial or complete disappearance of the 
growths 
the doctors injected three different kinds of antibodies each 
recognizes a different chemical structure that is unique to cancer 
cells 
the antibodies latch onto these chemical structures marking the 
cancer cells for destruction by other patrolling white blood cells 
to the researchers surprise they found that the cancer patients 
began making more of these antibodies on their own 
we are actually stimulating immunity with this treatment 
said morton we dont know why but it is happening 
morton presented his findings monday at the annual meeting of 
the american society of clinical oncology 
i was quite impressed by the response rate commented dr 
carol westbook of the university of chicago it appears to be a 
promising treatment that warrants further investigation 
however dr bruce cheson of the national cancer institute 
cautioned that melanoma is particularly hard to study the course 
of the disease can be difficult to predict and the cancer may go 
away for reasons that have nothing to do with the experimental 
treatment 
melanoma is curable in about 90 percent of cases when it is 
caught early however it is fatal if it progresses and spreads 
throughout the body 
melanoma like other less dangerous forms of skin cancer can 
result from overexposure to the sun and people with light 
complexions or irregularly shaped moles are at highest risk 
an estimated 27000 new cases will be diagnosed in the united 
states this year and the disease is believed to be increasing at a 
rate of 3 percent or 4 percent a year 
among other research presented at the meeting 
the acne drug accutane appears to significantly reduce the risk 
of second cancers in people who undergo treatment for 
smokingrelated tumors of the mouth and throat in a comparison 
study on 100 people dr waun k hong of md anderson cancer 
center in houston presented evidence that the drug a synthetic 
form of vitamin a suppresses abnormal growths from turning 
cancerous 
also on monday medical experts advising the food and drug 
administration said stronger efforts are needed to make sure women 
do not use accutane during pregnancy because it can cause birth 
defects the advisory committees rejected the advice of some within 
fda who want accutane withheld from all women to eliminate any risk 
of birth defects from the drug 
granulocyte colony stimulating factor a genetically engineered 
substance that speeds up production of white blood cells can 
offset a major side effect of cancer treatment often people 
receiving chemotherapy must stop their medication because the drugs 
lower their blood counts leaving them open to infection 
dr jeffrey crawford of duke university medical center tested 
the growth factor on 126 lung cancer patients and found that it 
reduced low blood counts and infectedrelated fever by 44 percent 
a study by dr charles g moertel and others from the mayo 
clinic helps doctors handle the dilemma of how to treat colon 
cancer patients whose tumors have spread through the bowel wall but 
have not visibly invaded the lymph nodes since threequarters can 
be saved with surgery alone doctors are reluctant to offer 
chemotherapy 
the new study found ways of identifying the 25 percent whose 
tumors are highly likely to spread moertel found that those whose 
tumors have unusual genetic characteristics or have perforated the 
bowel would probably benefit from chemotherapy

if you want to learn the zucchini method of 
playing the piano or need sheet music to furry lice by 
beethoven the carl fischer store is the place to go 
customers who fracture the language and the lyrics dont deter 
the musictrained salesclerks but it helps if they can hum a few 
bars 
its better than when they tell you theyre looking for a 
certain music book and all they know is that its green said 
larry heidel floor manager at carl fischer which stocks 610000 
titles and bills itself as the worlds largest music store 
just before closing time monday heidel and two salesmen stood 
at the counter as a young woman sang i love you then dropped 
off into a hum 
she was the fourth hummer of the day at fischer where singing 
whistling and tapping on the counter are an acceptable substitute 
for knowing the name of what you want 
a lot of them are just like your average joe who takes his 
first piano lesson and his teacher tells him to get something but 
he doesnt write it down said salesman tom potter or people 
hear something on the radio and dont catch the title 
then theres that business about music being the universal 
language of mankind a lot of times titles are in foreign 
languages and people somehow put them into english heidel said 
a customer once asked for christmas intruder when he wanted 
christmas intrada another requested furry lice instead of 
fuer elise 
wash it off was really wachet auf by johann sebastian 
bach and the zucchini method of piano playing is the suzuki 
method 
once the goal is clear salesclerks may have to search through 
an inventory that would stretch a mile high if stacked it includes 
everything from classical to gospel to heavy metal 
the business named after its founder was started in 1872 in new 
york it opened its chicago store in the 1920s when wabash avenue 
was the citys music row and was filled with piano stores music 
publishers and other establishments that catered to musicians and 
music lovers 
the chicago store is the companys largest boston and new york 
have the others and headquarters is in new york 
printed music is fischers specialty the department that sells 
guitars metronomes and refrigerator magnets in the shape of

japan cant have it both ways defending a 
closeddoor import policy while advocating liberalized global 
trade says agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
japan cannot insist upon one set of rules for goods and 
services where it is internationally competitive and another set 
of rules where it is uncompetitive yeutter said in a letter to 
tomio yamamoto japanese minister of agriculture forestry and 
fisheries 
yeutter predicted april 9 that japan would dismantle its rice 
import ban by the end of this year when the uruguay round of trade 
talks is scheduled to conclude 
the talks are being held under the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade with an objective of reducing or eliminating world trade 
barriers 
yeutters may 18 letter to yamamoto which was released on 
monday was directed at the ministers recent remarks in tokyo 
accusing yeutter of meddling in japans internal affairs 
yamamoto was reported to have angrily reacted to yeutters 
flatout prediction that japan would open its door to rice imports 
after working so hard over the past three years to manage this 
issue in a nonconfrontational way i am personally offended and 
deeply distressed to read that i am nonetheless accused of 
interfering in japans internal policy yeutter wrote 
yeutter recalled that as us trade representative in the reagan 
administration he twice rejected petitions from the us rice 
industry for section 301 retaliation against japans 
restrictive import policies 
your comments seemingly indicate that japan is not prepared to 
liberalize its rice market in the uruguay round he told 
yamamoto if that is the position of your government then i 
erred in rejecting those section 301 petitions 
further he said japanese government officials repeatedly 
assured me that japan was prepared to negotiate on its agricultural 
import restrictions including rice if the united states and other 
nations were also prepared to negotiate on their agricultural 
import restrictions and other distortive trade practices 
yeutter said japan agreed conceptually to do that when 
yamamotos government concurred in the launching of the uruguay 
round 
at a 1989 midterm review in montreal japan agreed to negotiate 
substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and 
protection he said 
recent comments by japanese officials that japan will never 
liberalize its rice market are contrary to all the commitments that 
have been made by your country during the uruguay round process 
yeutter said 
yeutter expressed hope that he and yamamoto could get together 
soon to talk more about the rice issue

an agriculture department report says a 
dramatic increase in wheat production this year will help rebuild 
us stockpiles and probably will mean stiffer regional competition 
for some export markets 
total wheat output has been projected at more than 269 billion 
bushels a rise of more than 650 million bushels from the 
weatherreduced 1989 harvest 
it would be the biggest yeartoyear increase on record besides 
resulting in the nations thirdlargest wheat harvest the report 
said monday winter wheat alone is forecast at 209 billion 
bushels up 44 percent from 1989 
as a result of the larger crop lean stockpiles are expected to 
increase by june 1 1991 to about 765 million bushels from an 
estimated 442 million bushels this june 1 
wheat prices received by farmers in 199091 are forecast at 
290 to 330 per bushel down from an average of 371 in 198990 
and 372 in the 198889 marketing year 
the 199091 price relationships and competition across classes 
kinds of wheat may change dramatically from 198990 the report 
said supplies of hard red winter wheat will be up sharply 
resulting in more competition with hard red spring for the hard 
wheat market 
hard red winter wheat is concentrated in kansas and other parts 
of the central and southern great plains while hard red spring 
wheat is mostly in northern areas white wheat is grown mainly in 
the pacific northwest and soft red winter is raised in the eastern 
third of the country 
larger crops and reduced imports are expected in south asia 
the report said this will mean that the larger us white wheat 
crop will have to compete with soft red winter for export markets 
such as egypt that take both classes of wheat

indians and those working with them sent us some great recipes 
using usda commodity foods she said 
from the recipes we received we picked the ones for this book 
that taste good use commodities for at least half the ingredients 
use few pots and pans and are quick and easy to make nelsen 
said

us tobacco sold overseas is often targeted at 
women and the young carries no warning labels and threatens the 
health of people in developing countries former surgeon general c 
everett koop says 
export of tobacco products is a moral outrage koop said at 
the world conference on lung health meeting on monday 
while smoking in the united states dropped 5 percent last year 
american tobacco exports rose 20 percent koop said about 100 
billion cigarettes were exported last year he said 
from 1971 to 1981 cigarette smoking increased in asia and latin 
america by 30 percent more than the population increase koop said 
there is no sense in planning for the longterm economic 
health of a foreign society and providing that society with foreign 
aid on the one hand if the physical health of the people of that 
society is fundamentally endangered during that same long term 
koop said 
koops comments were bolstered by those of the health officials 
from developing countries 
dr judith mackay director of the asian consultancy on tobacco 
control in hong kong said for every smoker that stops in 
boston two more start in beijing 
the bush administration is negotiating with thailand to seek 
openings for the tobacco trade like other asian countries 
thailand has a state monopoly on tobacco products 
a recent general accounting office report said the negotiations 
were at odds with the administrations stated policy of promoting 
good health 
andy copenhaver of the us cigarette export association in 
washington said allowing american tobacco companies to market their 
products in asia would not increase the number of smokers 
asian countries such as japan korea and taiwan have opened up 
to foreign tobacco companies only in recent years since then 
smoking rates there have either declined or increased at the same 
rate as before copenhaver said 
mackay said estimates of how much smoking costs developing 
nations in health care insurance and lost wages were not available 
dr carlos alvarez herrera president of the latin america 
coordinating committee on smoking control in argentina said 
tobacco companies are entrenched in latin america 
tobacco advertising is everywhere at all times theaters 
opera houses many sporting events popular concerts herrera 
said we cannot compete with their public opinion

a new study says that beer company sponsorship 
of motorsports races encourages drunken driving by fans including 
young men with long shag haircuts and women with tight pants 
and braces 
beer industry supporters called the study elitist nonsense 
breweries spend 50 million a year to link beer and fast cars 
in a carefully crafted effort to promote beer especially among 
working class youth and young adults who are part of the car 
culture said the american automobile association report 
released by a coalition of safety and health groups monday 
in dueling news conferences at the national press club the 
coalition and the beer institute painted sharply differing images 
of the motorsports crowd 
the fans at one beersponsored event at san franciscos cow 
palace included teenagers and young men with long shag haircuts 
spotty complexions work boots and denim pants young women with 
tight pants braces and hairsprayed bouffant hairdos said the 
study 
racing fans are overwhelmingly adult said less richter of 
the national association of stock car auto racing who spoke at the 
beer industry event they are employed they are respectable 
citizens and they are too intelligent to believe any of the 
nonsense promoted in this booklet 
the 92page aaa report concluded that brewers target bluecollar 
youth by sponsoring motorsports racers and events across the 
country youth in that class are the most likely to drive drunk 
said the report which was based on previous studies observation 
of 14 events and interviews with 60 high school students 
the report offered no new scientific evidence of a link between 
drunken driving and beer ads or sponsorship of racing events but 
researcher david buchanan coauthor said it documents the way beer 
companies dangerously link beer and fast cars in the minds of 
racing fans 
the beer institute said the research was faulty one participant 
at the news conference united auto workers union legislative 
director dick warden characterized the coalitions view as 
elitist and condescending against bluecollar workers 
institute president james sanders said 98 percent of racing 
enthusiasts are over 21 years old and the typical fan is an 
attractive customer for nearly any type of consumer product 
at the coalition news conference chairman alexander wagenaar 
was flanked by an ad showing a race car through a glass of miller 
beer and a coors tshirt emblazoned with a picture of a bigwheeled 
monster truck 
wagenaar released copies of scolding letters to beer company 
executives and announced an effort to help drivers gain nonbeer 
sponsors 
the groups announced symbolic sponsorship of two relatively new 
race drivers michael schriefer of manhattan beach calif and 
randi lynn hubbard of aberdeen washington in lieu of the several 
hundred thousand dollars sponsors often provide both received 
stickers reading drive alcoholfree to post on their vehicles 
ms hubbard said she has built her own monster truck but has 
been excluded from some competition sponsored by alcohol and 
tobacco companies because she uses her truck to campaign against 
the use of restricted substances by youth 
im not going to change my mind said the mother of three 
teenage daughters im going to continue to tell kids that 
drinking and driving is unsafe 
wagenaar said the coalition formed in january to promote a 
nationwide campaign against drunken driving includes 100 safety 
and health groups

president fw de klerks tour 
of europe has thrilled whites here who hope decades of 
international isolation may be ending but it has dismayed blacks 
who fear it may harm the antiapartheid cause 
it is wonderful to go to europe with the knowledge that south 
africa is busy taking its rightful place in the international 
community de klerk said before departing may 11 on his 
ninenation trip which runs through may 26 
de klerks foreign tour is the most successful by a south 
african leader since world war ii and it has dominated the local 
media tv and radio have followed every development and newspaper 
front pages are filled with long accounts of the presidents 
activities 
the iron friendship boomed a banner headline in the sunday 
times after de klerk held talks with british prime minister 
margaret thatcher red carpet for fw in paris proclaimed the 
citizen after de klerk met french president francois mitterrand 
for white south africans frustrated by decades of enforced 
international isolation de klerks warm reception in europe seems 
like a dream come true descended from europeans white south 
africans value their ties with western nations and fret over their 
countrys poor reputation because of apartheid 
de klerk has raised hopes around the world that apartheid is 
about to end and his cordial treatment in europe has stirred hope 
among whites here that west european and other nations may ease or 
lift economic sanctions and help boost the stagnant south african 
economy 
my general impression is that europe is ready to take specific 
steps is really ready to do this reevaluation de klerk said in 
london 
since assuming power last august de klerk has made major 
reforms he released black leader nelson mandela and legalized 
black opposition groups he has committed the government to ending 
whiteminority rule and sharing power with the 28million black 
majority 
those reforms and the south african leaders pragmatic style 
appear to have impressed european leaders france britain and 
other nations have expressed cautious optimism that south africa 
stands on the verge of historic change 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said the european 
community was considering reductions in sanctions to help the 
reform process in south africa 
we need to consider how we pinpoint the signals so we can 
give encouragement hurd said 
the 12 european community countries have banned imports of iron 
steel and gold coins from south africa for more than three years 
and also banned new investments in south africa 
but the prospect of a reduction in sanctions has alarmed the 
african national congress already concerned about the way de klerk 
has been received 
the anc the main black nationalist group insists sanctions 
must be maintained to ensure the white minority government meets 
its commitment to end apartheid 
the warmth of his de klerks reception here is not a good 
sign for us said sisa ngombane an anc representative in europe 
the talk of easing sanctions is not a welcome development 
this is a move by de klerk to bust sanctions i think the wrong 
signals are being given to him at this stage he said 
mandela will attempt to offset some of de klerks triumph when 
he tours europe next month he is likely to urge leaders not to 
make any concessions on sanctions 
south african newspapers have said mandela also will be trying 
to diminish de klerks newfound prestige de klerk and mandela are 
likely to be competing for attention on backtoback visits to the 
united states in june 
de klerks current journey offers a sharp contrast to the last 
major overseas tour by a south african president former president 
pw botha was shunned by some heads of state when he toured seven 
west european nations in 1984 
yet de klerk is under pressure to produce something more 
substantial from his trip than good feelings south african 
officials say they need concrete economic and political concessions 
to help deflate rightwing white opposition to ending apartheid 
de klerk deserves something more tangible than kind words as a 
reward said foreign minister pik botha

disheartened by us reluctance to allow the 
export of supercomputers to israel scientists in that country are 
researching a new system more powerful than anything the united 
states has israeli university officials say 
three israeli institutions have applied for licenses to buy cray 
and ibm supercomputers but the permits have been delayed out of 
us concern that israel might use the fastcomputing systems to 
develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles 
us government agencies have been considering the applications 
for almost two years but thus far have refused to grant the permits 
the writings on the wall said maia hauser the us 
spokeswoman for technion israels leading hightech university 
well have to go it on our own the university is asking 
supporters in the united states to raise funds for an alternative 
to the us computers 
technion applied in 1988 for a cray2 computer for scientific 
and engineering research the weizman institute of science and 
barilan university also have pending license requests 
the commerce department which has final say on the licensing 
is banned by law from discussing supercomputer applications 
israel has set up a government committee to investigate the 
feasibility of researching socalled parallel processing said 
technion vice president brian silver 
in most computers no matter how powerful computation proceeds 
as one calculation at a time known as serial processing 
in some problems multiple results might be calculable 
independently of each other and a parallel processing machine 
is designed to save time by doing those independent calculations 
simultaneously 
us and west german scientists have developed some parallel 
processing computers and some very specialized machines are 
available 
israel would have gone into such research anyway because that is 
the wave of the future in supercomputers but the us hold on the 
supercomputers has given the project a strong push silver said 
theres not much difficulty in us producing them within 
several years if we decide to said silver 
technion scientists already have begun theoretical research into 
parallel computing and laboratories are being set up to conduct 
experiments he said 
technion also has discussed buying a sophisticated west german 
computer which uses applications of parallel computations to 
serve as a basis for a future israeli supercomputer he said 
supporters of the sale of supercomputers to israel note that 
saudi arabia which is technically in a state of war with israel 
has been allowed to buy two crays from the minnesotabased cray 
research corp 
but us officials say those computers went to saudi arabias 
oil company for use in seismic research noting that the saudis do 
not have an indigenous nuclear weapons program which could benefit 
from the machines 
india which is known to be developing nuclear weapons has 
bought one supercomputer for weather predictions and has a pending 
request for another 
israeli officials say that preventing israel from buying 
supercomputers will not stop the development of nuclear weapons 
israel is known to have developed such arms on its own without 
supercomputers 
silver said technion had agreed to submit to inspections on the 
cray system to make sure it was not used for military purposes but 
opponents of the sale say computer use is difficult to monitor

president bush plans to renew chinas 
mostfavored nation trading status for another year even though 
the decision is sure to provoke another round of criticism in 
congress administration officials said monday night 
the president is expected to tie the annual renewal to a 
provision giving him the option of withdrawing the privileged 
status quickly if he so choses based on chinas humanrights 
performance said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
bushs chief spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday night no 
decision on the issue had been made bush must act by june 3 
but sources said bush would rather confront the issue sure to 
touch off another round of criticism in congress now rather than 
wait until the deadline which is only one day before the first 
aniversary of the tiananmen square massacre 
the president would also like to clear the boards of the 
decision before the may 31june 3 summit with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev the officials said speaking on the condition 
of anonymity 
although bush has recently voiced disappointment with chinas 
performance in the aftermath of the crackdown he decided that 
depriving china of mostfavorednation status would be too drastic 
a step the officials said 
bush himself at a news conference last week expressed 
reservations about stripping china of the trade benefits for fear 
that it would harm the economy of hong kong 
some 85 billion worth of chinamade goods are reexported to 
the united states each year hong kong officials have claimed that 
revocation of chinas mostfavorednation status would make these 
goods subject to tariffs of up to 70 percent 
mostfavorednation status entitles nations to the lowest rate 
of tariffs and other trade benefits that are available to the 
united states major trading partners 
however some nations including the soviet union have been 
denied mostfavorednation treatment because of their humanrights 
policies 
congress can act to block bushs decision but it seems unlikley 
that it could muster the twothird majorities needed to overturn 
his action 
sen pete wilson rcalif who returned to washington with bush 
monday evening on air force one said a decision to renew 
mostfavorednation status would likely be upheld by congress 
despite some grumbling 
its not as emotional an issue as the student visas one 
wilson said 
he was referring to bushs veto last winter of a bill to extent 
the visas of chinese students in the united states after a heavy 
lobbying campaign the president won that battle in a close vote 
that sustained his veto 
chinas vice minister of trade has said his country could lose 
almost a fourth of its 43 billion worth of annual exports if the 
united states does not renew chinas mostfavorednation trade 
status 
the viceminister shen jueren estimated the loss at 10 
billion worth of exports which would be the great bulk of chinas 
12 billion in shipments to the united states from the effect of 
price increases caused by an increase in the average tariff from 9 
percent to 50 percent 
chinas leading exports to the untied states are clothing shoes 
and toys the united states ships china about 57 billion worth of 
goods each year led by wheat aircraft and fertilizer 
china would revoke its mostfavorednation designation of the 
united states in retaliation shen said

senate republicans are waging rhetorical 
warfare against a democratic proposal they say would effectively 
rule out capital punishment in the united states 
sen orrin g hatch rutah assailed a democratic provision in 
the crime bill that would permit those sentenced to death to use 
statistical evidence to argue they were the victims of race 
discrimination 
sen strom thurmond rsc said the provision sponsored by 
sen edward m kennedy dmass is based upon the premise that 
the death penalty is currently imposed in a racially biased 
manner 
in advance of mondays opening of senate floor debate on a 
wideranging crime bill conservatives argued that kennedys 
proposal amounted to an indirect attempt to outlaw capital 
punishment 
the overall package would authorize the death penalty for 30 
federal crimes including presidential assassination but 
prosecutors seeking to carry out a sentence would have to show it 
wasnt being done in a racially discriminatory fashion 
the office of management and budget said monday that if 
enacted the provision would have the effect of setting up an 
irrefutable presumption of discrimination based on a failure to 
achieve specific numerical proportions in the imposition of the 
death penalty 
thurmond said a majority of our nations blacks support the 
death penalty and he cited justice department statistics saying 
that 19 of every 1000 whites convicted of murder are sentenced to 
death compared with 12 of every 1000 blacks convicted 
meanwhile the chairman of the senate judiciary committee sen 
joseph biden ddel accused the bush administration of playing 
politics with the crime bill 
biden said he was disturbed about recent accusations by 
president bush and vice president dan quayle that the senate has 
not moved aggressively in the law enforcement arena 
we have heard in my view too often a lot of rhetoric 
suggesting that the presidents crime bill has been languishing in 
the senate since last may and i think its time to set the record 
straight biden said he noted that some elements of the bush 
package already have been passed including the 1988 bill allowing 
the death penalty for murders committed by drug kingpins 
bush in a speech to a law enforcement audience in portland 
ore sunday accused congress of spawning weak imitations of 
his proposals to attack crime after allowing them to languish for a 
year 
we must reject those who softpedal the need to be hard on 
crime bush said he accused lawmakers of sitting on key 
anticrime proposals although the president did acknowledge that 
congress agreed to his request for more federal law enforcement 
officers prosecutors and prisons 
biden maintained that congress not only passed key elements of 
the original bush package but that lawmakers strengthened it 
made it stronger 
on the remaining issues such as capital punishment and the 
length of time prisoners have for filing federal appeals he said 
the administration seems to have no interest in negotiating with 
democrats 
congress got to work on this proposal right away biden 
said just four months later the full senate had passed every 
single request in the second part of the presidents crime package 
that is the funding for law enforcement the teeth the portion 
that will and has begun to make a difference in terms of making the 
streets safer for americans 
so i think we should kind of hopefully put aside this sort of 
partisan banter the senator said and hopefully not hear about 
how the presidents crime bill has been left to languish on capitol 
hill 
the time to play politics on this kind of issue is over 
biden said

medical experts say stronger efforts are 
needed to make sure women do not use the acne drug accutane during 
pregnancy because it can cause birth defects 
the drug that offers hope to people suffering from a severe 
disfiguring form of acne also can cause serious birth defects in 
one out of four cases where the mother used accutane during 
pregnancy officials say 
experts on two committees advising the food and drug 
administration agreed monday that the manufacturer 
hoffmanlaroche has alerted physicians and patients to the birth 
defect risk but the committees recommended that more be done to 
get the word out 
hoffmanlaroche officials said they were pleased with the 
recommendations two of which were similar to additional warnings 
the company had announced earlier in the day 
the fda advisory committees rejected the advice of some within 
the agency who want accutane withheld from all women to eliminate 
any risk of birth defects from the drug 
the committee actions came as other physicians were reporting 
that accutane can significantly block the growth of new tumors in 
people being treated for smokingrelated cancer of the mouth and 
throat 
accutane has been on the market since 1982 to treat what is 
called severe recalcitrant cystic acne 
in september 1988 roche dermatologics a division of 
hoffmanlaroche began a program aimed at educating physicians 
about the importance of having patients avoid pregnancy during 
accutane treatment 
roche officials say 86 cases of birth defects have been reported 
to the company as being associated with accutane since the drug was 
first marketed 
but david graham an fda medical epidemiologist said that 
number represents only about 10 percent of the number that actually 
occur he estimated that since 1982 nearly 1000 babies have been 
born with birth defects associated with accutane 
graham also estimated that 90 percent of the women using 
accutane do not have the severe form of acne for which the drug is 
intended they could be treated with other drugs without the kind 
of risk accutane poses he said 
accutane was prescribed last year for about 65000 women of 
childbearing age graham said less than 4000 women are estimated 
to have the severe form of acne that requires accutane treatment 
the overprescribing exposes tens of thousands of women to the 
possibility of a malformed child if they become pregnant while 
being treated he said 
graham said one study found that women using accutane underwent 
twice as many abortions as women not using the drug 
roches pregnancy prevention program has failed to achieve its 
objective he said the only way to eliminate exposure is to 
eliminate use of this drug by women 
however robert armstrong director of medical affairs for roche 
dermatologics said grahams estimates were based on shaky 
assumptions 
he also said that no one is sure how many women have the severe 
acne but he said he was sure the number of congenital 
malformations that result from accutane are not as large as graham 
believes 
if there were that many out there they would be noticed and 
reported armstrong said 
the advisory committees recommended that the company emphasize 
the importance of a pregnancy test before a patient starts using 
accutane it also recommended a way for patients to return any 
unused accutane at the end of treatment 
the company said it was undertaking similar measures 
the panels also said forms to record patient consent now 
available in english and spanish should be available in more 
languages and physicians should be encouraged to refer accutane 
patients for contraception counseling

auto industry lobbyists are working to head 
off attempts to toughen smog controls in the house clean air bill 
including a requirement to build 1 million nongasoline powered 
cars a year 
the proposal being pushed by rep henry waxman dcalif is 
expected to provide the most fireworks when the air pollution 
control bill comes up for floor votes on thursday 
the sweeping legislation is the first strengthening of federal 
clean air laws in 13 years and imposes new curbs on acid rain 
pollution industrial toxic releases and smogcausing emissions 
from industry and automobiles it is expected to cost more than 21 
billion a year when fully implemented 
the senate approved a similar measure in april 
the house began debate on the clean air bill monday while 
closeddoor talks continued in an effort to work out compromises on 
some of more than a halfdozen proposed amendments 
agreements were reached on several amendments including a 
measure aimed at curbing pollution over national parks and 
requiring a cleaner gasoline blend in smogtroubled urban areas 
according to participants in the talks 
but sources involved in the closeddoor discussions said late 
monday it was all but certain that waxmans alternative fuel car 
amendment would be left for a showdown on the house floor 
waxmans amendment calls on automakers to produce nongasoline 
powered automobiles for sale in the nine us cities with the 
highest air pollution the cities are los angeles san diego 
houston chicago milwaukee baltimore new york philadelphia and 
hartford conn 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce 
committee who has been protective of auto interests is strongly 
opposed to the production mandate 
he said monday he considered all the really important 
environmental issues to be already resolved and suggested those 
remaining in dispute represented little more than a difference of 
viewpoint among congressmen 
waxman said his measure differed little from a proposal offered 
by president bush a year ago which the white house later backed 
away from following strong auto industry opposition 
the amendment calls for automakers to produce 500000 
alternative fuel cars for sale in the nine cities by 1994 and 
double that number by 1996 the cars would cut auto emissions in 
those cities by 75 percent by the end of the decade according to 
waxman 
auto industry lobbyists have argued for weeks that the mandate 
would push alterative fuel cars onto the road too quickly saying 
they may be forced to make cars they cant sell 
until we know how to produce these vehicles in volume you run 
the risk of killing the program by forcing it onto the public too 
quickly said william ball a lobbyist for general motors corp 
in an interview monday 
daniel weiss a lobbyist for the sierra club scoffed at 
suggestions by the automakers that they might not be able to sell

most elderly americans know they need a 
sensible diet to stay healthy but one in five say they skip at 
least one meal a day according to a survey released today 
the survey also found that 45 percent of senior citizens take 
multiple prescription drugs which can affect appetite or 
absorption of nutrients 
also one out of four surveyed had a household income under 
10000 a year 
yet while about 85 percent said a healthy diet plays an 
important role in preventing and recovering from illness only 18 
percent said they worried a lot about a proper diet and more than a 
third said they dont worry at all 
the survey was released by the nutrition screening initiative a 
fiveyear project launched by a coalition of medical health care 
and aging groups 
nutrition is one of the important vital signs just as blood 
pressure or pulse said dr gerald keller an official of the 
american academy of family physicians a leader of the coalition 
the fact is however america has not effectively incorporated 
routine nutrition screening and care into the nations system of 
health care delivery he said 
the initiative will focus first on the elderly who face a 
disproportionate nutritional risk for a variety of reasons 
many live alone and tend not to cook while others have reduced 
appetite and sense of taste sometimes because of the medications 
they take said paul kerschner senior vice president of the 
national council on the aging 
the initiative will include efforts to educate health care 
professionals administrators and policy makers about the need for 
proper nutrition plus media campaigns aimed at the elderly and 
those who care for them 
the survey was conducted by peter hart research associates inc 
a sample of 802 people over age 65 was polled by telephone feb

mayor marion barry says he is ready to go to 
trial next month on drug charges but is asking a judge to keep six 
new charges against him a separate matter 
barry is handicapped by the lateness of the new charges and 
by the governments refusal to disclose details of the charges his 
lawyers said in court papers monday 
the mayor was indicted may 11 on a charge of conspiracy and five 
counts of cocaine possession the six new charges were added to 
eight previous ones brought feb 15 
the june 4 trial would include all 14 charges 
barry said he wanted to go to trial june 4 as scheduled on the 
eight earlier charges five misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession and three felony perjury charges while handling the 
six new charges as a separate matter 
the government has refused to disclose names of alleged 
coconspirators or to give the place time and witnesses involved 
in the new charges barrys lawyers said 
given the governments reluctance to deliver the information 
and the shortness of the time until trial it may be highly 
disadvantageous for barry to proceed to trial on the new charges 
the court papers said 
barry was charged in the february indictment with five counts of 
cocaine possession and three felony charges of lying to a federal 
grand jury in connection with his alleged involvement with drugs

the government has announced it 
will strip the communist party of all the property it was granted 
use of during the past four decades 
the decision monday followed a move three days earlier to freeze 
ownership of all buildings and other fixed assets owned by the 
communists who were ousted from power in a peaceful revolution 
last year 
the moves were likely to be highly popular in czechoslovakia 
where up to 100000 people have attended recent street rallies 
calling for the communists to give up their property and urging a 
ban on the party in upcoming free elections 
kvestoslava korinkova head of the governments inspection 
commission said all contracts for property used by the communists 
will be declared null and void on june 1 a week before the 
countrys first free elections in more than 40 years 
such contracts were very often made under strange 
circumstances ms korinkova said 
she said the property would be turned over to educational 
cultural health and other institutions or to other political 
parties 
she did not say how many buildings would be affected but she 
estimated the total value at 306 million 
last friday parliament froze 281 million in fixed assets of 
the communist party pending investigation of each acquisition 
korinkova said the acquisitions would be considered legal only 
if made before nov 17 1989 the start of the popular revolt 
against communist rule and only if paid for from party dues

us taxpayers will foot manuel noriegas legal 
bills until 20 million of his frozen assets are confiscated or 
released under a deal that averts disclosure of secret us 
payments to the fallen dictator 
before the deal was reached monday noriegas lawyers had 
threatened to quit the drug trafficking case because they hadnt 
been paid prosecutors froze the former panamanian leaders assets 
contending they were illegally obtained 
in agreeing to cover noriegas legal fees the government headed 
off a confrontation over 11 million in us intelligence agency 
payments he claims to have received over several decades 
noriegas lawyers had been trying to force the government to 
produce secret records of those payments to show noriega had 
legitimate sources of income other than drugs but on monday the 
defense agreed to drop the subpoenas when the deal involving 
noriegas legal fees is formally approved 
the us government wanted to avoid litigation that would get 
into matters having to do certainly with classified information 
with payments by our government and other governments to noriega 
defense attorney jon may said 
us attorney dexter lehtinen told us district judge william 
hoeveler that the government agreed to cover the legal bills to 
assure mr noriega receives a fair trial 
the long and complex nature of the case made it possible for the 
prosecution to invoke a federal law allowing the unusual 
arrangement he said 
noriega who was in court in his generals uniform agreed to 
sign affidavits declaring he was indigent and promising to repay 
the government if his assets are released 
it cant be said that the american taxpayer is paying for 
this because all the funding for the generals legal fees will 
come out of the seized assets said chief defense attorney frank 
rubino 
defense attorney steven kollin has estimated noriega would need 
5 million to properly defend himself the defense contends 
prosecutors have spent 12 million so far and are prepared to spend 
25 million more to convict noriega 
hoeveler gave his blessing to the agreement but it is subject 
to approval by chief us district judge james king a hearing was 
set for thursday 
the us government has frozen 27 noriega accounts around the 
world valued at 20 million 
defense attorneys had subpoenaed records from the cia drug 
enforcement administration and other agencies for evidence of 
payments to noriega during the period he is said to have been a 
us intelligence agent 
prosecutors acknowledge the united states paid noriega but 
the amount is substantially less than that offered by the defense 
counsel said diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys 
office she would not elaborate 
prosecutors submitted a list of payments to the judge monday but 
insisted it be kept secret 
noriega was indicted in 1988 on charges of taking 46 million 
in bribes from the medellin cartel to protect cocaine smuggling 
into the united states 
he turned himself in to us authorities jan 4 two weeks after 
the invasion of panama he is being held at the federal 
metropolitan correctional center outside miami

the tshirts are out the vodka billboards 
are coming down and the bids to take mikhail gorbachev fishing or 
bearwatching dont seem to stop 
everybodys got an angle no doubt about that says vern 
freeh vice president of international affairs for minnesotabased 
land o lakes inc a food processing and farm supply cooperative 
we all want to meet him 
since it was announced last week that gorbachev will spend six 
hours in minnesota on june 3 gov rudy perpichs office has been 
swamped with requests to meet the soviet leader hundreds of people 
have offered gifts or tributes and entrepreneurs quickly kicked in 
with tshirts and a tell it to gorbachev hotline 
gorbachev wants to spend two hours talking with agricultural and 
business leaders to build on longstanding economic ties between the 
soviet union and minnesota 
perpich said monday that a final intinerary has not been 
determined but that gorbachevs visit will probably include an 
address at a rally at the capitol in st paul 
the rest of his sixhour visit remained up for grabs at least 
thats what the callers hoped 
weve been receiving hundreds of phone calls every day said 
eileen biernat a perpich aide 
an ely man who can call black bears out of the woods to meet 
with tourists offered to summon bears so gorbachev can have his 
picture taken with them and the breezy point city council thinks 
gorbachev would enjoy an hour or two of walleye fishing 
other suggestions 
in minneapolis urban league president gleason glover wants 
gorbachev to meet with minnesotas minority leaders foreign 
dignitaries glover said rarely make contact with us minority 
groups 
duluth officials plan to ship 173 old voting machines to 
petrozavodsk duluths soviet sister city to replace its paper 
ballots duluth replaced the machines last year with a computerized 
system 
for 10 minnesotans can dial a 900 telephone number for 
updates on the gorbachev visit and to tape messages for the soviet 
leader 
among those hoping to profit on the hoopla in minnesota are 
tshirt makers morton rykiss of diversified arts said his company 
has five designs including one reading hugs to the kids in 
russia from the kids in minnesota with love 
the distributor of minnesotamade karkov vodka announced monday 
that it would remove billboards in the twin cities that show a 
likeness of gorbachev holding a bottle of karkov under the caption 
the partys over a reference to the communist partys troubles 
some minnesotans felt the billboards which went up before 
gorbachevs visit was announced would insult the soviet leader 
we never imagined this much controversy and we certainly 
didnt imagine this much press said gerry schmitt a partner and 
creative director of minneapolis ad agency schmitt amp sloan we 
set out to create a brand awareness for karkov and one way or 
another it has 
out west gorbachev can expect a mixed reception when he arrives

and in the city to complain about the unchecked rise of 
antisemitism in the soviet union said spokesman marshall platt

global military spending barely 
declined last year and the public has gleaned no disarmament 
dividend or peace prize from the thawing of the cold war arms 
researchers reported 
in its annual yearbook released monday the stockholm 
international peace research institute also reported that 26 
developing countries have acquired ballistic missiles capable of 
delivering nuclear chemical or biological warheads 
the proliferation of these superlethal missiles has created a 
new fear of arms races among emerging regional powers said the 
institute commonly called sipri 
the 700page report said however that cashstrapped third 
world countries bought fewer weapons and spent less money in 1989 
about 16 billion than at any time since 1976 
in 1989 the prospects for lasting peace have considerably 
improved particularly in europe but peace has not yet broken 
out said walter stuetzle director of the 24yearold research 
institute 
sipri which is financed by the swedish government tracks 
developments in global arms traffic military conflicts and 
disarmament initiatives 
stuetzle a former west german undersecretary of defense told a 
news conference that the ussoviet strategic arms treaty under 
negotiation would not reduce nuclear arsenals enough to have an 
impact on military capabilities 
us secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze announced after talks in moscow 
saturday that major progress had been made that may allow a treaty 
to be initialed at a summit next week and signed before years end 
there is still room for drastic reductions stuetzle said 
the treaty has no military relevance when you talk about 
deterrence or perception 
in its report sipri said 950 billion was spent worldwide on 
defense last year a 2 percent drop from the previous years 
after the dizzying heights of the 1980s global defense 
spending began to fall in 1989 the decline was modest however 
and was due more to tight budgets and technology advances than to 
peaceful intentions it said 
the united states and the soviet union trimmed military spending 
by about 2 percent but natos european members kept their defense 
budgets stable in east europe cuts were announced but wont be 
felt until next year 
neither the political will to pursue reductions beyond this 
level nor the reward in the form of a disarmament dividend or peace 
prize are forthcoming it said 
though arms control prospects looked bright performance did 
not match up to promises in reducing military spending it said 
the report also made these points 
the number of wars and major regional conflicts fell last year 
to 32 from 35 the fewest in three years in addition about 75 
lesser conflicts were waged defined as involving fewer than 1000 
deaths 
the soviet union led the world in arms exports last year 
though the value shrank to 116 billion from 125 billion the 
previous year and from 147 billion in 1987 nearly threefourths 
were sold to third world countries us arms exports totalled 
107 billion and about 76 percent went to industrial nations 
india for the third successive year was the worlds largest 
arms importer spending 38 billion japan was second spending 
31 billion 
the cost for destroying chemical weapons will be enormous 
even for those countries like belgium and denmark still keeping 
75yearold stocks from world war i the united states must spend 
3 billion while the soviet union still lacks the technology to 
safely demolish its arsenal

rep bill schuette said he was visiting his 
district town of mount pleasant mich on friday when a woman 
walked up to him 
i have my keep the pledge button on said the republican 
who is challenging democratic sen carl levin in this falls 
election and she comes in puts her finger on the button and 
says way to go bill keep it up 
schuette is one of many capitol hill republicans sporting keep 
the pledge buttons these days its a plea to president bush to 
not abandon his no new taxes campaign promise during budget 
negotiations with congress 
but the buttons and the voters sentiments they elicit also 
are an example of a very real external pressure on the white house 
officials and congressional leaders who are trying to forge a 
fiscal 1991 budget deal 
this is an election year and the closer the talks drag to 
primaries and to election day the more reluctant lawmakers will be 
to agree to tax increases or deep spending cuts the third session 
is set for today 
theres a serious problem with trying to do this in an 
election year house budget committee chairman leon panetta 
dcalif one of the negotiators said last week both parties 
have already begun to posture on the issues 
democratic feelings are still ruffled by white house chief of 
staff john sununus comments before the bargaining even began that 
bush would never seriously consider raising taxes 
sununus remarks were later disavowed by white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater who reiterated that everything including new 
taxes was negotiable 
but democrats remain angry and poised to strike back 
last week the democratic congressional campaign committee sent 
six pages of talking points to democratic house candidates 
listing arguments they could make against tax increases enacted 
during the reaganbush years included was a full page entitled 
the sununu tax crunch listing 10 tax boosts sununu presided 
over while governor of new hampshire 
sununu who has spent the past week reiterating bushs no new 
taxes lie raised taxes 10 times while he was governor of new 
hampshire the paper said 
further adding to the political decibel level were three 
democratic congressmen they called a news conference last thursday 
to criticize bush for not making a nationally televised speech 
detailing the deficit problem and his proposal to address it 
the president isnt about to do that now before even having a 
chance to bargain with democrats but that didnt stop the 
lawmakers from using the opportunity to attack bush 
sometimes one has to use that bully pulpit for leadership 
said rep charles schumer dny 
republicans are not sitting mute either 
eighteen gop senators sent a letter to bush promising they would 
oppose any budget deal that includes new taxes and schuette has 
collected more than 40 signatures from house republicans for a 
letter asking bush to reject any package with tax increases 
the republican party stands for the working men and women of 
this country and has consistently opposed efforts to raise taxes 
the note says 
none of this has made the work of the budget negotiators any 
easier 
were trying to walk through it and you have the hatfields 
and the mccoys firing shots over our heads said panetta last 
week 
the negotiators have such a complicated task that their sessions 
are expected to last weeks and perhaps months 
one conferee was heard suggesting we could get it done by 
december said rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican 
on the house budget committee and a participant in the talks 
in the end the onset of the campaign season could actually end 
up speeding the negotiators task the bargainers know that the 
sooner they finish their job the easier it will be to line up a 
majority of votes in the house and senate to enact whatever budget 
pact emerges 
but for now the prospect of the upcoming elections does little 
but complicate the already problematic task of reaching a budget 
compromise

nearly all of el salvadors top military 
commanders have been in charge of units linked to human rights 
abuses according to a study released on the eve of a house battle 
over cutting us military aid 
fourteen of the countrys 15 senior military officials have 
commanded units documented to have killed civilians tortured 
prisoners kidnapped citizens or covered up such abuses found a 
study by the arms control and foreign policy caucus 
the report did not seek to establish direct participation in 
human rights crimes by the officers who include chief of staff 
col rene emilio ponce but it said the groups rise to power at 
least illustrates a striking lack of accountability in the 
countrys military 
caucus chairman rep howard berman dcalif said the results 
call into question a united states policy which has provided nearly 
4 billion in aid to el salvador over the past decade onefourth 
of that directly to the military 
when we got involved in el salvador we gambled that we could 
reform the el salvadoran military berman told a news conference 
this report makes it tragically clear that this gamble failed 
the caucus a group of members of the house and senate who have 
opposed us policy toward el salvador for years issued its report 
a day before the house was to begin a battle over whether to cut 
the 85 million in annual us military aid in half this year and 
next the cut would include new conditions to pressure the 
government and leftist rebels to reach a negotiated peace 
the amendment being considered today was part of a bill 
authorizing new economic aid for the new democratic governments in 
panama and nicaragua 
democratic proponents of the aid cut predicted they would 
narrowly win that vote which they hope will be a strong signal to 
both the salvadoran government and to the bush administration that 
us policy is headed for a sharp turn 
opinion on capitol hill has turned increasingly against the 
salvadoran military since the murders last nov 16 of six jesuit 
priests their housekeeper and her daughter nine military 
personnel have been charged in the murders but there is widespread 
skepticism about whether the killers will ever be brought to 
justice 
secretary of state james a baker iii in private meetings with 
congressional opponents of the administrations policy has agreed 
some conditions should be imposed on new us aid but he has 
objected to linking the issue to the panamanicaragua aid bill 
in a speech monday to corporate executives deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger suggested the link could delay 
consolidation of the new democracies 
i personally think it is outrageous eagleburger said i 
am not here to bash the us congress but there are some in that 
body that deserve it 
the report also found that 12 of the 15 topranking officers 
were 1966 graduates of the countrys military academy and part of a 
large class whose personal loyalties take precedence over the rule 
of law 
many officers have detailed knowledge of each others 
questionable business practices information which can be used to 
blackmail others into stonewalling human rights investigations it 
said 
one us official told congressional investigators that after 
the jesuit killings a lot of officers knew something was up and 
they didnt come forward they are a tight group 
and a us embassy official interviewed in el salvador told 
investigators that 5 to 15 percent of the military is made up of 
ghost soldiers who do not exist but whose pay is funneled to 
commanders

anybody can roll around the capital in a 
darkwindowed limousine but what it costs depends on who you are 
a teenager on the way to the prom can end up paying six times more 
than an aging big shot 
thats age discrimination say three area high school students 
who filed complaints with local government consumer officials 
teenagers are charged the most even though limousine service 
managers say theyre often the best behaved they dont drink and 
they tip well because its not their money 
adults pay roughly 60 an hour for a chauffeurdriven limousine 
and the customer determines how long the rental will last teenaged 
promgoers pay a lump sum of about 400 for a minimum of six hours 
kearney c francis 16 said she called 30 area limousine 
services wanting a chauffeur to drive her and her friends to a 
restaurant then around the city for a quick tour and then to the 
prom where they would find their own way home all in all a 
threehour job 
francis says she discovered such an order was impossible to 
fill the companies she contacted all asked her if she was renting 
the limousine for a prom they then told her she must rent it for 
at least six hours and pay the lump sum up front 
i asked them why it was different for a prom and i never 
could get a straight answer she said 
during prom time thats the way all the companies do it 
said senora pyles of ritz limousine in capitol heights md who 
told francis she would be charged 375 for six hours and could not 
rent it for a shorter period 
asked if a couple wanting a sightseeing tour would be charged 
the same pyles said no wed go out of business if we charged 
you a sixhour minimum she said 
andrea delvillar office administrator of congressional 
limousine in bethesda md says the students are paying for the 
motherly approach for 432 and a sixhour minimum all paid 
up front the students dont have to worry about paying the tax 
and the tip and have an evening of promptness and worryfree 
driving 
congressional limousine unlike many other services however 
includes sparkling wine and flowers in their prom packages 
francis says all customers not just students should be free 
from worrying about good service taking care of your patrons 
should be part of your service not something you pay extra for 
delvillar says adults also are charged a sixhour minimum on 
weekend nights but acknowledged if its a young voice on the 
phone ill say is this for a prom and then discuss the package 
with them 
but keith shifrin a classmate of francis said he called a few 
limousine services twice first saying he was arranging a prom 
date then again saying he wanted a limousine for a sightseeing 
tour with his wife 
the prom calls received quotes of package deals the tour calls 
received quotes of 59 to 65 an hour with no set minimum 
finally francis said her father leslie francis called arrive 
in style limousine service and negotiated a threehour package for 
180 no questions asked 
pat bowie of arrive in style said however his company does ask 
teenagers if they are reserving a limousine for the prom and we 
keep a list of all the prom nights in the area 
arrive in style then charges 395 with a sixhour minimum 
its just a business decision since most of your proms run five 
to 12 hours 
judy doctor manager of consumer education at the montgomery 
county md office of consumer affairs said she had received 
franciss complaint which she filed along with stefanie felrice 
and miriam plotkin and the county would begin investigations for 
discrimination and possible violations of the countys consumer 
protection law

band director george foreman raised his 
hands and let them drop in a quick downbeat summoning a brassy 
musical flourish from about two dozen trumpet trombone and tuba 
players 
the martial melody and its bouncy rhythm conjured a nostalgic 
picture from the turn of the century when thousands of brass bands 
performed on weekends at community parks all across the country 
but the fanfare being played at a recent rehearsal of the 
advocate brass band was newly written and some music observers say 
the 3yearold group and its music are part of a slow but steady 
revival of brass bands 
the band is preparing to play host for the great american brass 
band festival june 1617 the festival will be held at the city 
park in this central kentucky town known for its antique charm and 
victorianstyle homes 
this night however the musicians were getting ready for the 
debut performance of the newly composed the advocatemessenger 
march 
the song in the tradition of newspaper anthems such as the 
washington post march is named for the local daily paper the 
bands sponsor the group has a large collection of rarely heard 
marches named for a wide array of american papers 
as many as 20000 people are expected for the festival which 
will include a balloon race buggy rides and displays of antique 
cars and bicycles 
we want to capture the nostalgia of a concert in the park 
said foreman cochairman of the festival and managing director of 
the norton center for the arts at centre 
through much of the 19th century and into the 1920s the brass 
band was a familiar part of the american town the bands played at 
political rallies parades parties and concerts 
harpers magazine in the 1880s reported that there were 10000 
brass bands in the united states foreman said 
brass bands began to decline foreman believes because world 
war i took away many of the musicians and the advent of radio and 
phonographs gave people other entertainment opportunities 
paul droste president of the north american brass band 
association said there are about 60 brass bands in the country 
the association was formed in 1983 when the bands began to rebound 
after nearly dying out in the 1950s 
droste a music professor at ohio state university is also 
director of the brass band of columbus a britishstyle band that 
has been named champion of the association four times in the past 
five years 
the columbus band is expected to be among eight bands at the 
noncompetitive danville festival among the other groups will be 
dejans olympia brass band of new orleans the sevenpiece band has 
performed at mardi gras jazz funerals in movies and on television 
its a unique musical approach harry mayronne olympia 
brass band business manager said of the festival were excited 
about playing in it its exploring all areas of brass band music 
another is mr jack daniels original silver cornet band of 
lynchburg tenn which has played at the white house lincoln 
center and three public tv specials 
the advocate brass band started in 1987 when the danville 
advocatemessenger asked foreman if he would put together a band to 
play at an oldfashioned political stump rally it was sponsoring 
when it was over nobody cared much about the speeches said 
mary schurz publisher of the newspaper but they loved the 
band 
the newspaper decided to sponsor the band it purchased uniforms 
for the members to wear during its six public performances each 
year 
there are several college and high school band directors an 
optician stockbroker and a space systems engineer in the 25piece 
band vince demartino a nationally known trumpeter plays cornet 
i think this is what communities are all about by providing 
music and entertainment and a musical experience for ourselves 
said demartino its great enjoyment for me its great 
relaxation and a nonpressure situation

justice louis peck says he feels like a 
condemned man who has won a reprieve the right not to be forced 
into retirement at 70 
a federal appeals court in new york ruled monday that the 
71yearold vermont supreme court justice could remain on the bench 
peck had been placed on retirement status by the courts 
administrator thomas lehner and his last day on the job was 
marked in for june 30 1989 
vermonts constitution requires all judges to retire at age 70 
but peck would have none of it and he filed an age discrimination 
complaint 
i feel like a condemned man who has had a reprieve peck 
said after the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld a federal 
judges ruling in his favor personally it is very satisfying 
however peck said he may retire anyway 
lehner said he had no immediate comment 
the ruling settles the peck case but not the mandatory 
retirement issue 
two other federal appeals courts the 8th circuit based in st 
louis and the 1st circuit in boston have ruled against judges 
wanting to stay in their jobs despite retirement provisions in 
their states 
obviously congress has not made its intention clear if the 
courts disagree said william gray who represented the state of 
vermont against peck 
gray said the state has not decided whether to appeal to the 
us supreme court 
at issue was whether the federal age discrimination and 
employment act applied to appointed state judges 
vermont argued that judges fit one of the exceptions 
appointees on the policymaking level and that congress should 
not tell states how to set up their courts 
on the first argument the appeals court said appointed state 
judges do not fall under the exception on the second argument the 
judges said vermont had failed to show the federal law trampled on 
the rights of the states 
peck was appointed to the fivemember supreme court bench in 
1981 his term expires in 1993

an increase in stormie jones medication 
quieted doctors fears that the worlds longest surviving 
heartliver transplant patient was rejecting her second donor liver 
her conditions excellent she just needed an adjustment in 
her medication said dr robert d gordon transplant surgeon at 
childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
the 12yearold from white settlement texas returned to 
pittsburgh on sunday after tests showed high liver enzyme levels 
a sign of possible organ rejection she had been taking the 
japanese drug fk506 since her last operation on feb 20 
stormie will receive higher doses of fk506 intravenously until 
she is discharged probably within a few days and will take the 
drug orally when she goes home gordon said monday 
when youre using a new drug youre a little sensitive to 
toxicity oversensitive perhaps we now realize we lowered our 
dosages a little too much he said 
modifications in dosages also will be made for many of the 400 
transplant patients currently taking fk506 the food and drug 
administration approved the drug for use only at childrens and 
nearby presbyterianuniversity hospital 
i think weve been making that error systematically over the 
last few months gordon said 
in 1984 stormie received the double transplant to control a 
congenital condition that left her cholesterol levels 10 times 
higher than normal she received a new liver this year after 
hepatitis damaged her first donor liver 
the surgeon said stormie this time had a mild rejection episode 
which he said is not uncommon the first few months after a 
transplant 
were not alarmed he said we dont think this liver is 
in jeopardy or that shes looking at another transplant 
thats good news for stormie who has been awaiting a party for 
her 13th birthday on may 31 said her mother lois suzie 
purcell 
thirteen is a very special time in someones life she said 
shes excited shes running around all over the place

a group of revolutionaries who helped 
topple dictator nicolae ceausescu have come up with an unorthodox 
offer for communist party members to buy a way out of their 
political past 
for just one leu less than one cent communists can buy a 
certificate saying the holder no longer wants to be a member of the 
hated party or its youth branch 
the anticommunist group 21 december whose 2200 members 
all fought in the december revolution have decided to put aside 
the first 100 forms for the use of romanias new leadership 
we expect president ion iliescu to be on top of the list 
organization president alexandru nacu said monday iliescu the 
former communist official who leads in early returns from sundays 
elections fell out with ceausescu in 1971 and was demoted 
the romanian communist party never formally dissolved but 
nobody claims membership anymore all party property has been 
assigned to different organizations but the party still legally 
exists 
before the revolution there were some 37 million communist 
party members and about 4 million young communists 
we fought against communism in university square in december 
and we continue to do so therefore we believe we are morally 
entitled to certify the dissolution of the romanian communist party 
when it happens said lucian mihai the organizations legal 
expert he referred to a downtown bucharest square 
the december 21 group wouldnt predict when that might happen 
but the certificates could turn out to be quite lucrative for 
the group it plans to declare the two organizations dissolved only 
when enough certificates have been issued to cover at least half of 
the communist membership 
at a news conference monday launching the new plan the group 
sold at least five certificates including one to its leader nacu

appear before a grievance committee investigating his conduct in 
the tawana brawley case

found by a grand jury to have concocted a tale of rape at the hands 
of a gang of whites 
in 1988 attorney general robert abrams filed complaints with a

against officials and investigators 
robert h strauss chief counsel for the committee said the 
suspension imposed monday will remain until maddox agrees to 
cooperate maddox has repeatedly refused to respond to the 
complaints or testify the panel said 
maddox charged that the suspension was an attempt by abrams to 
punish him for his vigorous and zealous representation of miss 
brawley the case raised racial tensions in new york city in 
198788 
this was expected we knew that mr abrams had to have his 
way this is a prosecutorial vendetta maddox said i will not 
be taking it lying down this wont be lowering the racial 
temperature in his town 
abrams office refused to comment on the suspension 
miss brawleys advisers maddox lawyer c vernon mason and the 
rev al sharpton had told her her not to cooperate with the 
investigation of her charges on the grounds it was part of a racist

operation rescue declared no court will deter 
its members from blocking abortion clinics in new york boston or 
atlanta 
the us supreme court on monday allowed a permanent ban on 
operation rescue demonstrations that blocked access to abortion 
clinics in the new york area it was the third legal setback in two 
weeks for the antiabortion group 
the justices without comment or any recorded dissenting vote 
left intact a federal judges order barring operation rescue 
members from interfering with women entering the clinics 
our sole purpose is to stop these women from taking their 
children in said operation rescue spokesman bob jewitt if we 
can save a child we will do that we will continue to do that 
injunctions wont stop us 
abortion rights advocates acknowledged the difficulty of 
stopping the protests 
i know they will not go away said diana m gurieva 
president of planned parenthood of new york city but the 
decision will strengthen the resolve of law enforcement and the 
lower courts to at least punish these people appropriately 
last week the high court voted 54 to leave intact a similar 
ban on operation rescue blockades at clinics in atlanta also 
monday massachusetts attorney general james m shannon secured a 
court order barring antiabortion groups from obstructing access to 
clinics in that state 
the courts order in the atlanta case was preliminary in a 
dispute that reached the justices as a request for emergency help 
before georgia courts had finished studying the controversy 
randall terry founder of operation rescue said in a statement 
that no court can prohibit us from rescuing babies 
these judges have joined the heritage of nazi judges who 
sanctioned the murder of the innocent the day of judgment will 
hold terrifying consequences for them he said 
auxiliary bishop austin vaughn a suburban new york cleric who 
rebuked gov mario cuomo for supporting abortion rights said he 
wondered how martin luther king jr would have reacted to an 
order that told him it was illegal to continue his civil 
disobedience 
bill baird who operates two long island abortion clinics 
called the supreme court decision a tremendous victory that 
recognizes women have the right to go in a building 
but id like to see the courts go further and assign federal 
marshals to escort women in just as they escorted blacks into 
buildings in the 1960s he said 
he said he doubted the courts announcement would end harassment 
outside clinics youre dealing with religious zealots here 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said she couldnt be more pleased with the ruling but she also 
warned abortion rights supporters not to get too optimistic 
this is the only victory weve had since webster she said 
referring to the supreme court ruling last summer that gave states 
more room to restrict abortion

a federal judge has demanded prosecutors 
disclose who approved the alleged kidnapping of a mexican doctor 
charged in the murder of us drug agent enrique camarena 
us district judge edward rafeedie asked for the information to 
be divulged at a hearing scheduled for friday on the manner in 
which dr humberto alvarez machain was brought to the united states 
for trial 
witnesses said the 42yearold gynecologist was abducted april 2 
from his office in guadalajara at the behest of the drug 
enforcement administration 
the affair has strained relations between the united states and 
mexico president carlos salinas de gortari said mexicos 
sovereignty had been violated 
at a conference monday the judge told prosecutors id like 
to know the highest level of authority who authorized this 
the judge has delayed the trial pending the outcome of the 
hearing 
camarena 31 was kidnapped off a guadalajara street in 1985 
testimony at the trial of three men in 1988 revealed that he was 
tortured and interrogated by drug lords before being slain along 
with his pilot their bodies were found on a ranch 65 miles outside 
guadalajara 
prosecutors maintain that alvarez administered drugs to revive 
camarena so the agent could tortured further before he was slain 
three mexicans and a honduran are on trial for their alleged 
roles in the murders of camarena the pilot and two tourists who 
prosecutors said were mistaken for drug agents 
outside court alvarez lawyer robert steinberg said he would 
call four or five witnesses at the hearing among them he said 
will be antonio garate bustamante a former mexican police officer 
who has said he arranged the doctors abduction at the behest of 
the dea 
dea officials have vowed to capture and prosecute every person 
involved in the camarena murder 
steinberg said he would argue that rafeedie has no jurisdiction 
over the alvarez matter and should either send it to the world 
court for resolution or return the doctor to his native mexico 
give it to the mexican authorities and let them prosecute it 
if they wish the attorney said

the rainswollen trinity river hit its 
highest level here in 48 years but the vast amounts of water being 
released into the river through the floodgates of livingston dam 
dropped

second of water roar through the dam engineers reduced the amount 
monday to 98400 
the releases dictated by the rising water have flooded 
thousands of acres below the dam normally 8000 to 9000 cfs pass

late monday the trinity was at 2983 feet in liberty 
surpassing the previous record depth of 2951 feet in 1942 said 
jim mitchum coordinator of the liberty county emergency management 
office

the home of howard pipkins in the past two weeks the home which 
had been remodeled after it filled with two feet of water last 
summer had become an island 
i hate to see that happen said mitchum he worked real 
hard to get that house from getting water he was talking earlier 
about jacking up the house in case it broke 
the red cross estimated 4600 homes have been affected by 
flooding in the sevencounty area spokesman bill barron said 500

a dispute over the hatfield town bell 
appears to have rung to a close with a judges ruling that the 
hourly tolling must cease 
the ruling was met with relief by a pair of newcomers living 
next door to the bell and with dismay by townsfolk who had argued 
the chiming was a treasured part of the new england character of 
the 320yearold farm community 
a certain part of the heritage of the town has been 
disrupted selectman thomas hurley said monday after superior 
court judge john f murphy ordered that the 92yearold bell be 
stilled between 9 pm and 7 am 
selectman chairman george zgrodnick jr said the ruling would 
mean turning off the bell permanently because the town cant afford 
an automatic timer the bell was sounded monday night but was to be 
turned off this morning 
richard and pamela carnall who had moved from nearby 
northampton in 1988 had claimed the chiming was keeping them up at 
night 
after selectmen refused to stop the chiming the couple sued the 
town a jury may 14 declared the bell a nuisance but decided that 
only mrs carnall was injured by its ringing and that the couple 
was not entitled to damages 
based on the ruling the carnalls asked the judge to silence the 
bell at night 
w michael ryan the carnalls lawyer said the ruling actually 
recalls an old tradition of ringing the bell at curfew weve 
ended a 20thcentury tradition and revived a colonialfederalist 
era tradition he said 
the carnalls had earlier offered to pay for a timer but the 
offer has been withdrawn ryan said 
the carnalls were unavailable for comment monday ryan said 
when the carnalls bought their 19thcentury house across from 
the first congregational church the bell was not working but six 
months later it was fixed the couple who have a young daughter 
complained the bell deprived them of sleep

nato should consider revamping its 
military structure by using multinational forces as us troop 
levels in europe are reduced us defense secretary dick cheney 
said today 
cheney taking part in his second nato defense ministers 
meeting in two weeks said the western alliance must adapt if an 
eastwest conventional arms pact is reached and the threat of war 
against the warsaw pact recedes 
if all present positive trends continue then we can 
contemplate new ways of doing business cheney told reporters 
aboard his plane en route to brussels 
i think based on a first look the notion of a multinational 
force has some appeal cheney said i think its worth 
pursuing 
cheney arrived in brussels today for a twoday meeting of nato 
defense ministers to discuss the alliances future military posture 
the ministers are holding a series of discussions in advance of 
a summit of nato leaders in july president bush proposed the 
summit as a way to discuss changes in the role of the north 
atlantic treaty organization in light of the upheaval sweeping 
eastern europe and the soviet union 
the defense ministers meeting comes at a time when german 
unification is advancing rapidly and pressure is growing in 
washington for sharp cuts in military spending and reductions in 
the 300000strong us force based in europe 
using multinational forces in nato could offer cost savings and 
ease nationalist sensitivities particularly in west germany where 
most nato troops are stationed said a senior defense official 
traveling with cheney 
such forces could also help blunt any drive to take a unified 
germany out of nato 
one way to emphasize the multilateral nature of the nato 
alliance is to have units that are composed of troops of various 
nations cheney said such a plan would also emphasize the fact 
that germany is not treated any differently than anyone else 
as an example cheney said a multinational corps could be formed 
with three divisions each from a different nation a us division 
is made up of about 15000 to 18000 soldiers 
at present nato land forces defend territory under a socalled 
layer cake formula by which an army from an allied nation 
defends a certain sector 
us forces for example are stationed primarily in southern 
and central west germany while french and british forces defend 
other regions 
with the elimination of the border between east and west 
germany such a system would have to be revamped 
under a multinational system us german or british soldiers 
could be dispersed among several nations said the senior defense 
official he spoke on condition of anonymity 
soldiers of multinational units could be based in britain or 
canada for training exercises the official said 
such an arrangement for example could help reduce complaints 
among the west german public west germans have grown increasingly 
irritated with nato military exercises and accidents caused by 
lowflying aircraft 
today there is the sense that germany is singled out because 
the majority of troops are on their soil the official said 
but the official cautioned that setting up multinational forces 
poses many problems including language barriers and varied weapons 
systems 
he said he expected the defense ministers to propose a study of 
the multinational force concept during their twoday session 
mainly they are trying to ask themselves how should nato 
look in this new environment in europe the official said

bostons public school system must maintain 
courtordered racial hiring guidelines and not base proposed 
teacher layoffs solely on seniority a judge has ruled 
us district court judge arthur w garrity said monday the 
school system must still achieve a teaching and administrative 
staff of at least 25 percent blacks and minorities after the court 
ends its involvement in boston school desegregation 
garrity made his remarks during a hearing on his plan for a 
final judgment that would end litigation in the longrunning case 
in 1974 garrity ordered the citywide busing of black and white 
children to integrate the citys schools the move sparked several 
years of busingrelated violence 
garrity said his final order in the case to be issued at an 
undetermined date will ensure that the quota remains in effect 
until minority teachers have achieved enough seniority to protect 
them from immediate layoffs 
several hundred city teachers are expected to be laid off 
because of budget cutbacks if minority quotas are eradicated 
black teachers fear they will be among the first to go because they 
have little seniority 
according to the boston teachers union contract layoffs are 
made solely on seniority the union has fought the continuation of 
the minority quota system 
garrity told the hearing that he wanted to end the courts 
direct involvement in the case because of a new school assignment 
plan implemented last year it goes into effect in september 
the principle reason for ending the involvement is that we 
dont have a plan anymore he said the controlled choice plan 
is in effect but its not the courts plan and we shouldnt be 
involved 
garrity monitored the citys compliance with the desegregation 
order until 1987 when a federal appeals court ruled that the 
schools were finally desegregated and gave control over student 
assignment back to the school committee

residents who maintain that their wisconsin 
community is the hamburgers birthplace are asking hamburg ny 
to change names with their town 
we just think its appropriate that we become hamburg said 
tom duffey honorary burgermeister of seymour 
duffey and his home of the hamburger inc organization contend 
the first hamburger was developed at a local fair in 1885 
he said hamburg should accept the name change because he 
contends their claim to being the hamburgers birthplace is false 
he said switching the name to seymour would be fitting because a 
former new york governor was named horatio seymour 
home of the hamburger inc grilled a 5250pound hamburger last 
year as part of its effort to promote the claim of seymour about 
10 miles west of green bay 
hamburg mayor richard hansen said he had not seen the letter 
from duffey requesting the move but would not agree to a change in 
names 
we believe very strongly that were the home of the 
hamburger he said we take great pride in that i dont care

north and south yemen merged their 
impoverished nations of tribespeople into a unified republic of 
yemen today and the new country stood on the brink of oil wealth 
gen ali abdullah saleh president of the unified state raised 
the new countrys red white and black flag atop the portside 
presidential council building 
the aden coast guard fired several cannon shots and ships 
hooted their horns as the flag went up 
the united republic of yemen has newly discovered oil field 
reserves estimated unofficially at 2 billion barrels 
at a later rally attended by 2000 people saleh said the 
united nation would remain committed to all treaties that either of 
the yemens had concluded 
the republic of yemen will be a factor for stability and 
security in the arabian peninsula and the gulf region and a strong 
bastion for the arab nations the arab league and joint arab 
action he said 
saleh said yemen would work for development and progress 
pledged to an opening up economically culturally and socially 
in line with the spirit of the age saleh said 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat was the 
only arab leader to attend the ceremony in aden 
the 48yearold saleh president of north yemen since 1978 was 
elected to head the fiveman council that will rule the new state 
at a meeting of senior leaders from the two yemens held before the 
flagraising ceremony 
ali salem albeidh secretarygeneral of south yemens ruling 
yemen socialist party was elected vicepresident 
the council named heider alattas the president of formerly 
marxist south yemen prime minister and asked him to form a cabinet 
on monday north yemens prowestern parliament approved a plan 
by saleh to merge with socialist south yemen 
north yemen radio reports said the 159member shura council or 
parliament had agreed with a sweeping majority to merge the 
yemens which are among the worlds least developed states sana 
the north yemeni capital is to serve as capital of the newly named 
yemen republic 
south yemens parliament the supreme peoples council also 
held a special session monday to approve unification of the two red 
sea nations 
it was the second such union between two arab states in this 
century in the 1950s egypt and syria joined as the united arab 
republic but the merger collapsed after three years because of 
internal squabbling 
the new state binds 11 million people 9 million from the north 
and 2 million from the south 
south yemen became the arab worlds only avowedly marxist state 
after it gained independence from britain in 1971 but it began to 
reform as democratic changes swept through the soviet union and 
eastern europe 
the two yemens are poor and undeveloped labor unrest in south 
yemen has been aggravated in recent months as western goods were 
transported from north yemen to the south 
strikes mushroomed in most government offices and factories in 
south yemen 
the merger bid has been outwardly promoted by oilrich nations 
on the arabian peninsula such as saudi arabia which is eager to 
snuff out soviet influence 
scores of cuban and east german military experts are said to 
have left aden the capital of south yemen in recent months a 
friendship pact entitles the soviets to maintain as many as 18000 
troops in the port city but the extent of their deployment is 
unknown 
the merger was originally planned for nov 30 but in recent 
days there had been pressure to speed up the schedule so the two 
yemens can attend an emergency arab summit on may 28 in baghdad 
iraq as one state 
the new flag is similar to the black white and red one of north 
yemen but without the stars 
a draft agreement on unification was agreed to by leaders of 
both nations on april 22 in the city of taiz halfway between aden 
and north yemens capital of sana 
a planned transition period of 2 years coincides with the 
remainder of the fiveyear terms for both legislatures

senior leader deng xiaoping blamed poor party 
leadership as the root cause for last years prodemocracy 
demonstrations west german sources said today 
the new communist party chief jiang zemin says he cannot rule 
out more such demonstrations this year the sources said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the comments came in talks with monday with former west german 
chancellor helmut schmidt they said 
the sources said deng and jiang took a generally conciliatory 
stance toward students who took part in the prodemocracy 
demonstrations which were crushed by the military in june 
deng chinas 85yearold patriarch said poor party leadership 
was the root cause of the popular drive for democratic reform 
thenparty chief zhao ziyang dengs protege was purged in june 
for being sympathetic to the student movement since then many of 
zhaos followers have been jailed or lost their jobs in a sweep 
against the ideologically suspect 
schmidt told deng that china suffered a serious loss of prestige 
when the military killed hundreds perhaps thousands in ending the 
democracy movement and that the west had no other choice but to 
downgrade relations with china 
the sources said jiang told schmidt the possibility of new 
demonstrations could not be excluded he said hostile forces 
are trying to make use of anniversaries of events during the 
demonstrations last may and june 
jiang said china has built up its riot police which is now 
betterequipped with nonlethal weapons 
luo gan secretarygeneral of the state council also told 
schmidt that only police forces not the military would be used to 
put down any future political unrest 
the sources also disclosed schmidt had recently exchanged 
letters with zhao who has not been seen since an emotional meeting 
with student hunger strikers on tiananmen square on may 19 1989 
he is being held under virtual house arrest in beijing 
the contents of the exchange were not disclosed but it was the 
first known incident of zhao being able to communicate with the 
outside world 
dengs meeting with schmidt was not mentioned by the chinese 
press today although the jiangschmidt talks were reported on the 
front page of the partys official peoples daily 
deng retired from his last official post as head of the state 
central military commission in march and the absence of press 
coverage of the schmidt meeting and a meeting on may 13 with 
egyptian president hosni mubarak are an apparent attempt to 
emphasize he is now a private citizen 
deng however is still regarded as chinas most powerful man 
with final say over major policy decisions 
the sources quoted schmidt as saying deng who is frequently 
rumored to be seriously ill appeared to be in better health than 
at their last meeting two years ago 
also today a chinese provincial newspapers editor and 
communist party secretary now in the united states has been 
expelled from the party for ideological mistakes his former paper 
reported tuesday 
the expulsion of cheng kai former editor of the hainan daily 
was the latest in a series of expulsions of reformists from party 
ranks since the student prodemocracy movement last year 
the hainan dailys brief frontpage report on cheng did not 
explain what ideological mistakes he made

and i hope its not going to be long casey said they said it 
had to do with technical difficulties with the airplane 
casey is flying a singleengine cessna equipped with pontoons 
that allow it to take off and land only on water 
casey had submitted a flight plan to soviet officials from 
nome to wherever theyd like me to go i told them i wanted to go 
from nome alaska to helsinki 
he suggested a route consisting of 500mile legs between places 
where he can land his plane called liberty ii on water near an 
airport 
the voyage is timed to get casey back to seattle in time for the 
opening ceremonies of the goodwill games on july 21 his departure 
from seattle on sunday marked the 63rd anniversary of the beginning 
of charles a lindberghs first solo transatlantic flight

path of the first globecircling flight by a pair of douglas world 
cruisers casey said 
im working out an alternate plan right now through the 
aleutian chain through attu towards japan but i still need one 
stop in the soviet union in the kuril islands he said 
casey and his project coordinator in seattle dan hood planned 
to contact soviet air traffic officials today 
his flight so far through alaska casey said was the way its 
always been beautiful 
he said he spent years flying in alaska as a bush pilot 
one main reason im doing this is im trying to promote the 
safety and versatility of general aviation especially in the lower 
48 he said 
the only place thats left doing what aviation was originally 
designed for is alaska up here flying is almost like driving a 
car you dont get all the problems that make flying difficult in 
the rest of the united states up here its survival it should be 
shown its a very very safe form of transportation

the carcasses of 16 wild elephants 
killed by gunfire were found in a sanctuary in eastern sri lanka 
the government said today and it blamed tamil rebels for the 
killings 
the dead elephants were found in the first two weeks of may in 
kumana jungle a wildlife and bird sanctuary 130 miles east of 
colombo 
the eastern and northern regions of sri lanka where most of the 
minority tamil population lives have been under the virtual 
control of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam rebel group since 
march 
a statement by the information department said the tamil tigers 
were illegally chopping down trees killing deer and wild buffaloes 
and setting up an explosives factory in kumana 
it said the elephant killings were under investigation but that 
the slaughter was probably an act done by the liberation tigers 
of tamil eelam to protect the laborers cutting trees 
a rebel spokesman denied the allegation saying it was made to 
tar our image he spoke on condition of anonymity 
hunting wildlife in sri lanka is banned and killing elephants 
can carry long prison sentences 
the kumana killings the single largest slaughter of elephants 
in the island in recent years has caused an uproar among 
conservationists and lawmakers 
sri lankas population of wild elephants has declined from 7000 
a decade ago to 2000 
the rebels moved into eastern and northern sri lanka after 
forcing the evacuation of indian peacekeeping troops who arrived in 
1987 under an indiasri lanka accord intending to disarm the tamil 
tigers and smaller secessionist groups 
the tamil tigers refused to disarm however and the sri lankan 
government eventually demanded that the indian troops withdraw 
the rebels began their independence campaign in 1983 
the tamils accuse the sinhalese majority of discriminating in 
jobs education and the use of sinhala language at least 11000 
people including 1100 indian soldiers have been killed in the 
rebellion 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent and control the government and the 
military

idahos attorney general hoped to garner votes in the southern 
and eastern parts of the state today in his underdog effort to win 
the republican us senate nomination over a veteran congressman 
the threeway republican race for the right to a longshot bid 
at stopping democratic gov cecil andrus from claiming an 
unprecedented fourth term seemed to have narrowed to state sen 
rachel gilbert and former majority leader roger fairchild 
late campaign polls showed a large share of gop primary voters 
still undecided and stockbroker milton erhart the only 
gubernatorial candidate with an abortionrights position needed a 
heavy turnout fueled by abortion backers to have any chance of 
overcoming limited statewide name recognition 
attorney general jim jones who spent only a few thousand 
dollars in radio commercials said i think a small to average 
turnout would be helpful to me a larger turnout would be a 
response to a massmedia campaign like us rep larry craig has 
conducted 
state election officials predicted an average turnout for a 
statewide primary of 30 percent to 35 percent 
for his part craig a solid favorite to succeed retiring 
republican sen james mcclure took nothing for granted he greeted 
voters in the boise and nampacaldwell areas before casting his own 
vote later in the day 
i think it will be a good win a strong win said the 
fiveterm lawmaker who hopes to become idahos third consecutive 
1st district congressman to win a us senate seat 
craig benefited from the campaign organization that helped 
mcclure win three senate terms 
he outspent jones 101 forcing his opponent to concede defeat 
in the more democratic 1st district of northern and western idaho 
and concentrate on the conservative southern and eastern 2nd 
district where craig had never run before 
boise businessman ron twilegar the former state senate 
democratic leader was the heavy favorite to win his partys 
nomination over political newcomer david steed 
in the campaigns final weeks steed has forced twilegar to 
defend himself against charges of financial impropriety in a 
federally backed venture capital company he ran 
the senate seat one of just three nationwide this year in which 
no incumbent is running has been held by republicans for all but 
eight years this century

nelson mandela today called 
the police killing of seven blacks a massacre and warned that 
efforts to end apartheid will collapse unless the government ends 
violence by the security forces 
the african national congress leaders comments came two days 
after police opened fire on protesters at welkom in the orange free 
state he said sundays killings cast doubt on the white 
governments commitment to its promises of major reform 
the government must not talk of negotiations and peace and 
expect us to join in the massacre of innocent people is 
inexcusable mandela said on his return from a visit to zimbabwe 
police commanders said welkom was tense but quiet today as armed 
police patrolled the area 
welkom has been the scene of several bloody confrontations 
between blacks and rightwing whites opposed to government plans to 
abolish apartheid and end whiteminority rule extremists have 
formed paramilitary white defense groups in the area 
police said they were forced to open fire sunday when hundreds 
of black protesters attempted to march from welkoms black township 
to the white town 
mandela said the government must curb the security forces and 
end a growing wave of violence that has claimed hundreds of lives 
in recent months 
the responsibility to end violence is that of the 
government he said 
the anc and the government of president fw de klerk are 
engaged in talks on ending whiteminority rule and sharing 
political power with south africas black majority mandela 
threatened to call off the talks when police killed black 
protesters in march but he later relented 
meanwhile another black leader mangosuthu buthelezi urged 
mandela today to meet with him to find ways to end violence in 
natal province where several thousand blacks have died in fighting 
between buthelezis inkatha group and ancbacked groups 
i can think of no two leaders who could make a greater impact 
in standing together to shame violence than mr mandela and 
myself buthelezi said 
a previous plan for talks in march between buthelezi and mandela 
collapsed after protests by some anc leaders who did not want any 
dealings with inkatha 
the anc and inkatha have a number of leadership and political 
differences inkatha favors a more conservative plan for south 
africa after whiteminority rule ends

yasser arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization is seeking permission to attend an 
emergency un security council session in new york but us 
officials said today no decision has been made on granting him a 
visa 
arafat made an indirect request for an entry visa in a letter to 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar expecting it would 
be passed on to the state department which denied him a visa two 
years ago for a similar mideast debate 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said no 
decision had been made they said the situation is hypothetical 
because he has not made a formal request it could remain so if the 
state department passes word back to the plo that the visa request 
would be denied 
arafat speaking monday in baghdad iraq appealed to president 
bush to pressure israel to stop what the plo chairman described as 
atrocities against palestinians 
arafat rejected israeli claims that the lone israeli gunman who 
shot and killed seven palestinian workers near tel aviv sunday was 
mentally unbalanced he accused prime minister yitzhak shamir of 
planning a criminal scheme against the palestinians and the 
intefadeh 
intefadeh is the arab name for the revolt against israels 
control of the west bank and gaza which were surrendered by jordan 
and egypt in their war against israel in 1967 
we appeal to president bush this time not to let the 
palestinian people down and to refrain from protecting the israeli 
crimes arafat said at a news conference 
arafat asked the united states not to use its veto to kill 
whatever resolution condmening israel migh be adopted by the 
security council at the request of the plo 
if arafat is allowed to attend the un session in new york it 
would elevate the plos stature at a time when israel is under 
pressure for using force to try to stem a violent uprising by 
palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
when the reagan administration declined to permit arafat to 
attend a un general assembly session in november 1988 the debate 
was shifted to geneva a month later in a reversal of policy the 
administration opened talks with the plo 
arafat acceding to us instructions had by then publicly 
renounced terrorism and said he recognized israels right to exist 
however the plo covenant still calls for dismantling the jewish 
state 
if the visa is granted arafat would have an opportunity to take 
charge of plo demands that the security council condemn israel for 
its treatment of palestinian arabs 
the state department in march reported to congress that the plo 
was adhering to its commitment renouncing terrorism nearly 30 
border and rocket attacks were launched by palestinian groups 
against israel since december 1988 but the report said we have 
no evidence in those cases or any others that the actions were 
authorized or approved by the plo executive committee or by arafat 
personnaly 
in denying the plos application for a visa in 1988 
thensecreretary of state george p shultz said the us 
government has convincing evidence that plo elements have engaged 
in terrorism against americans and other targets 
shultz said then that arafat knows of condones and lends 
support to such acts and is an accessory to such terrorism 
a month later schultz took the lead in opening us talks with 
the plo which are continuing in tunis the plo headquarters

nato defense ministers met today to 
take a hard look at the military strategy that guided the western 
alliance during the cold war years but now may be outdated 
the north atlantic treaty organizations key twoday meeting was 
to review what us defense secretary dick cheney called new ways 
of doing business in an era of reduced eastwest tensions 
on monday west european defense ministers meeting separately 
at the alliance headquarters in brussels urged nato to adapt to 
the changing security environment 
the ministers said it was of crucial importance to decide 
what level of defense was needed in a changing world 
we consider that discussion in the alliance on these issues is 
timely the ministers said in a statement at the end of their 
talks 
they also said west european countries must prepare to pay more 
in common defense costs as the united states moves to substantially 
reduce its military presence in europe 
as an example of new nato strategy in response to the impending 
unification of germany cheney raised the idea of a nato corps with 
divisions from different nations 
such a force would also emphasize the fact that germany is 
not treated any differently than anyone else he told reporters 
aboard his flight to brussels 
if all present positive trends continue then we can 
contemplate new ways of doing business cheney said 
less than two weeks ago the nato defense ministers held a 
meeting of the alliances nuclear planning group in kananaskis 
canada and agreed that there was a diminishing need for 
battlefield nuclear weapons in europe 
their current meeting this time as the defense planning 
committee is part of a series of discussions among highlevel nato 
officials that will culminate in an early july summit between 
president bush and the other alliance leaders 
nato is under pressure to move toward a political rather than a 
military role in an era of reduced eastwest tensions 
i think everybody accepts that business as usual is not 
possible said a nato diplomat discussing the meeting on 
condition of anonymity 
the defense officials were expected to take a look at the actual 
threat now posed by the sovietled warsaw pact the status of 
conventional arms reduction negotiations in vienna austria 
shrinking military budgets and the increased use of multinational 
forces 
they also will likely discuss their strategy of forward defense 
brought into question by the prospect of a united germany 
forward defense refers to the stationing of troops to defend the 
front line during an attack the idea is to defend territory at its 
border and not give up any land to invading soldiers the border 
between east and west germany soon to be erased is now considered 
part of the front line 
the ministers will likely call for studies of some of these 
issues as they review their future strategy 
there are many things which have been done for 40 years in a 
certain way which need to be revisited said the nato diplomat 
the ministers were considered certain to scrap a guideline in 
effect since the late 1970s that called for increasing military 
spending by 3 percent annually 
many countries have failed to meet that goal in recent years 
with easing tensions even fewer will hit the target now some 
countries like greece and turkey may keep spending up because of 
regional problems rather than fears of soviet aggression 
the ministers also will be asked to endorse defense plans based 
on an assessment of the current military threat posed by the soviet 
union said a senior nato official also on condition of anonymity 
he said the alliance needs to adopt a degree of prudence 
because of the uncertainty of the political upheaval in the east 
bloc but he said it also needs to be flexible to respond to future 
changes 
all 16 nato nations except france are represented at the 
meeting france is not a member of the alliances integrated 
military structure iceland which has no armed forces attends as 
an observer

nearly 2 million workers nationwide staged 
a 24hour strike today to protest government economic austerity 
measures shutting down transportation and businesses 
rallies were held throughout the country to denounce price 
increases and the abolition of inflationlinked wage increases for 
civil servants measures that were adopted after premier 
constantine mitsotakis took office in april 8 
it was the second general strike this year and labor officials 
said there could be more 
athens international airport the main gateway to greece was 
brought to a standstill when control tower and airline employees 
stayed off the job from 730 am to 130 pm only airlines with 
their own ground crews in athens resumed flights after the air 
traffic controllers returned to work 
public transportation in major cities banks and many businesses 
were closed down ferry service to the nearby islands was disrupted 
and piraeus the nations key port offered limited services 
the strike was called by the general confederation of greek 
workers the civil servants union adedy and smaler labor groups 
across the country the organizations claim a combined membership 
of 185 million workers 
the strike was a great success dimitris hadzisokratis a 
member of the workers confederation said in a telephone interview 
we are totally satisfied 
he said however that talks today with national economy 
minister george souflias had been disappointing 
the minister said that the government was not prepared to 
negotiate more labor action will follow he said 
labor minister aristides kalatzakos said the strike would only 
hurt greeces economy 
with todays strike it is estimated that 16 million hours 
of precious work time and over 14 billion drachmas 86 million 
are being sacrificed in the general attempt to overturn the 
governments economic policy he said in a radio interview 
greece faces 20 percent inflation this year and a 2 billion 
budget deficit some economists say the deficit could reach 4 
billion and prompt the international monetary fund to step in and 
force the country to take tougher measures 
premier mitsotakis who was elected april 8 has been visiting 
european capitals to win support and investments for greeces 
recovery he has said he would rather fall from office than tone 
down the austerity measures 
trade unions spurred by gains during the eightyear socialist 
government that ended last june say the austerity measures have 
seriously hurt the average workers buying power 
the measures include large increases in the basic costs of 
services and goods ranging from 20 percent for bus fares to 300 
percent for water 
we do not care whether the government remains in power or 
falls the secretary general of the workers conference dimitris 
kostopoulos told a rally in athens 
our concern is that the workers do not fall victim to capital 
and also that the law of the jungle does not prevail he said 
the last general strike was staged in january to pressure the 
coalition government in power at the time to uphold a promise that 
living standards would not be affected by austerity measures at the 
time those measures proved ineffective however and the economy 
deteriorated further

a packet marked nuclear triggers sent to the 
iraqi embassy contained harmless electronic components used in home 
appliances the foreign office said today 
iraqi diplomats said the packet received in the embassy mail 
last week was another campaign against their country and an 
attempt to strain britishiraqi relations 
but the foreign office said the episode appeared to be the 
work of a hoaxer 
these devices are widely available in hardware shops and have 
a range of domestic appliance use a spokesman said on condition 
of anonymity they would not require an export license and do not 
have a nuclear weapons application 
the spokesman said the iraqis had not handed over the envelope 
in which they said the devices arrived and it was impossible to 
trace where the letter was mailed 
the foreign office had the 28 small devices examined by defense 
ministry experts after the iraqis handed them in 
in march british authorities working with the united states 
seized a consignment of usmade capacitors at heathrow airport 
us prosecutors said the devices were powerful capacitors for 
detonating nuclear warheads 
iraq maintained they were destined for use on a nonnuclear 
university laser project 
britain subsequently expelled iraqi airways executive omar 
latif arrested in connection with an alleged plot to smuggle the

three teenagers appeared in court here 
today for painting antisemitic graffiti on the walls of a jewish 
cemetery in this community in eastern france 
two were paroled by the juvenile court after being formally 
charged with vandalism and racial injury and the third was freed 
the two charged were told not to meet withone another or carry 
weapons 
the youths who reportedly told police that they were inspired 
by hatred for foreigners were accused of painting long live 
hitler and dachau on the walls of a jewish cemetery on may 4 
that was a week before mourners discovered that 34 graves had 
been defiled and a corpse mutilated at the jewish cemetery at 
carpentras in southern france 
the carpentras incident outraged france and set off nationwide 
demonstrations against a perceived rise in racism and antisemitism 
there has been a wave of incidents involving desecration of

jeanmarie le pen leader of the farright national front of 
creating an atmosphere of racial hatred that set the stage for 
the carpentras desecration 
le pen in an interview today with the daily newspaper le 
quotidien de paris termed joxes behavior stalinist saying 
the minister was accusing him of crimes without conducting an 
investigation

his hometown of trinitesurmer who decided monday not to allow 
him to host a meeting of extremeright european leaders there next 
month 
municipal councillors in the atlantic coast town of 56000 
people said they were tired of being associated with le pen

political parties runs contrary to the fundamental principle of 
free assembly guaranteed by our constitution le pen said today

reward for information leading to the arrest of whose who 
desecrated the cemetery at carpentras

willie nelson the scruffy king of country music 
is carrying a business card these days and some who cherish his 
outlaw image may cringe because it lists him as a corporate 
chairman of the board 
nelson is heading up one of the latest entries in cable 
televisions entertainment channel boom his station is the cowboy 
channel and yes he really is chairman of the cowboy television 
network inc 
chief cook and bottle washer was how nelson described his 
duties during a brief interview monday at the national cable 
television associations annual convention 
nelson was just one of several celebrity attractions at the 
threeday convention but unlike the athletes movie stars and a 
playboy playmate of the year signing autographs for the crowd 
nelson also was there on business 
hes trying to drum up support among local cable systems for his 
new network which will feature cowboy movies and country music 
when it begins telecasts in november 
traveling around the country and around the world at 2 
oclock in the morning or 2 oclock in the afternoon its very 
difficult to find what i like to see which is a good western movie 
or some good music nelson said thats exactly the reason i 
got into this 
like many cable tv newcomers nelsons channel probably wont 
appeal to everyone and thats no mistake 
cable is narrowing its target audiences with an abundance of 
special interest stations and that specialization will dictate how 
cable is sold and delivered in the future experts say 
cable always has been an outlet for specialized programming like 
allsports espn and allnews cnn but newcomers are narrowing the 
approach even more with these new stations on display at the show 
in court television for legal junkies offers live coverage 
of noteworthy trials from us courtrooms as well as from abroad 
the golden american network for viewers that werent born 
yesterday features entertainment for an older audience with 
such veteran stars as steve allen morey amsterdam shirley jones 
and monty hall

islamic militants set off 11 bombs and 
youths fired bullets in the air to honor kashmirs top moslem 
clergyman who was buried today as 300000 mourners wailed and 
screamed 
security forces kept their distance apparently to avoid a 
recurrence of mondays violence when paramilitary police shot and 
killed at least 58 mourners 
maulvi mohammad farooq a recent convert to the kashmir 
independence movement was slain monday by three unidentified 
gunmen 
a few hours later security forces fired on a huge crowd that 
defied a curfew and carried farooqs body six miles to his office 
witnesses and official sources said 58 people were killed and 300 
were wounded the witnesses said the gunfire was unprovoked but 
some officials said the security forces were returning fire from 
moslem militants 
as massive crowds nearly onethird of srinagars population 
gathered again today the government withdrew all security forces 
along the route of the funeral procession which wound its way from 
islamia college to martyrs cemetery on the outskirts of srinagar 
farooqs rosecovered coffin was in a truck at the head of the 
milelong procession it took four hours to travel the four miles 
to the cemetery 
thousands of men and women weeping beating their chests and 
waving at the crowd lined the streets boys fired pistols and 
revolvers in the air 
farooqs blood will bear fruit we will attain independence 
they shouted 
as the funeral cortege reached martyrs cemetery militants set 
off 11 bombs at the far end of the adjoining prayer ground 
the crowd seemed to be expecting the blasts and bowed their 
heads then they screamed independence slogans 
farooqs son umar announced over loudspeakers that his fathers 
last wish was for kashmiris to unite in the fight for 
independence 
forty to 50 militant youths fired kalashnikov rifles and 
revolvers in the air after umar farooqs announcement the firing 
continued for 10 minutes until the coffin was in the ground 
the crowd dispersed after the burial 
some of farooqs aides blamed his killing on rightwing hindus 
while government officials accused moslem militants who thought 
farooq was too moderate 
supporters or representatives of several militant groups 
including the jammukashmir liberation front and the hezbul 
mujahedeen took the microphone at islamia college to tell mourners 
they were not responsible 
this has not been done by any militant one speaker said 
farooqs prominence in the troubled valley had been eclipsed by 
moslems fighting for an independent nation after the crackdown 
began on jan 20 he joined the demand for independence before 
that however farooq had urged a political settlement of the 
problem 
at the united nations monday secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said he was shocked and saddened by the assassination 
and he appealed for restraint by all sides 
because the violence and independence drive have heightened 
tensions between india and neighboring pakistan and perez de 
cuellar has been careful in his statement not to take sides 
today indias regular army troops were standing by in srinagar 
but were not deployed on the streets which were guarded by 
paramilitary police forces 
we are keeping watch over the situation said hamidullah 
khan chief secretary of law and order for jammukashmir he was 
contacted by telephone in srinagar 
mondays shootings pushed the death toll in the kashmir valley 
to about 460 since jan 20 when the government began its harshest 
crackdown on a violent separatist campaign of bombings kidnappings 
and assassinations 
the majority of those killed have been moslem militants or their 
supporters shot during antiindian demonstrations or while defying 
the curfews that have become a way of life in srinagar 
the secession movement has flared on and off since 1947 when 
india and pakistan were partitioned along religious lines upon 
independence from britain 
both india and pakistan claimed the territory 
initially most secessionist groups sought to join kashmir with 
moslem pakistan but in recent years the most militant groups have 
demanded unconditional independence 
two indianpakistani wars in 1948 and 1965 failed to resolve 
the kashmir question the region is split between the two nations 
along a contested frontier 
the western part of kashmir went to pakistan while the eastern 
part became part of indias jammukashmir state it is the only 
moslem majority state in india where 82 percent of the population 
of 880 million is hindu 
in jammukashmir moslems comprise 64 percent of the 6 million 
inhabitants hindus living mostly in the jammu region form 32 
percent

a census worker has been suspended for 
violating the us census bureaus tradition of confidentiality 
because he informed the police that a resident he questioned 
appeared to be using marijuana 
the bureaus cedar rapids office said stephen larson should have 
informed his superiors and let them decide whether to inform the 
police larson said he was told monday he was being suspended 
pending an investigation 
tom moss the district offices director said census 
enumerators make assurances that nothing will come out of this to 
anybody other than the census bureau

his report

cloud of marijuana smoke when a tenant opened his door he said he 
completed the census form with the resident who was cooperative 
and later went home and reported him to police 
i did what i thought was right at the time larson said 
but according to them his bosses you cant even notify the 
police when you witness a murder going on if it occurs in a house 
youre doing for the census 
moss said confidentiality does not take precedence over 
criminality or even suspected criminality 
i am not saying there is a higher priority on confidentiality 
over anything even a suspicion said moss im simply saying 
that whatever our people can do we must keep the confidentiality we 
promised people we promised the public that we wont tell 
sgt glenn fox of the narcotics division in cedar rapids said 
larson waited until late at night to make his report by then 
there was so little information we couldnt have acted anyway we 
added it to our intelligence file and that was it fox said 
fox said he can understand the census bureaus insistence on 
confidentiality but i admire the guy for standing up for what is 
right 
the mistake he made and no offense he should never have told 
the news media about it wed never have told anybody if he 
hadnt he said

positions and the hungarian armed forces state of preparedness

the senate agriculture committee voted tuesday 
for a bill that would require that fish processed as food be 
inspected in much the same way as meat and poultry 
currently less than 12 percent of american seafood undergoes 
some kind of inspection or grading said sen patrick leahy 
dvt chairman of the committee only 7 percent of almost 2000 
seafood processors nationwide participate in these voluntary 
inspection programs 
meat and poultry undergo rigorous inspection by the agriculture 
department 
a consumer advocate who has been campaigning since 1986 for 
similar standards for fish praised the bill but said it was 
missing two essential features 
ellen haas founder of public voice for food and health policy 
said she hoped to see an amendment added on the senate floor that 
would require fishing boats to be inspected 
she also said she was disappointed the committee removed 
whistleblower provisions in the bill that would have protected any 
employees of inspection programs who call attention to alleged 
misconduct or deficiencies 
they are the insurance of a program with integrity said 
haas senator leahy said he is committed to fight for it on the 
floor 
haas said the bill is strong as it stands but gives a great 
deal of responsibility to the industry 
similar legislation is pending in the house but has not yet 
been approved by the agriculture committee there 
under the senate bill the agriculture department would 
set standards for processing fish 
determine sources of potential contamination 
require prevention and cleanup procedures for contaminated 
areas 
assure through inspections that fish and food made from fish 
are processed under sanitary conditions 
the food and drug administration which administers the limited 
fish inspection program that exists would continue to decide the 
level of contamination that is considered harmful 
the commerce secretary would be authorized to close waters that 
are considered too contaminated for safe fishing 
imported fish would have to comply with all the standards set 
for fish harvested domestically 
grants totalling 2 million would be provided each year to 
educate fish processors on proper handling methods

the superintendent of yellowstone national 
park says a new study that maintains the return of wolves to the 
park will have little impact on other wildlife is the most thorough 
look yet at the proposal 
but us rep ron marlenee rmont calls it poppycock 
adding that the 586page report shipped to capitol hill on monday 
says exactly what the national park service and the us fish and 
wildlife service proponents of the wolf recovery proposal 
wanted it to say 
us sen james mcclure ridaho is expected this week to 
introduce legislation calling for wolves to be transplanted to 
yellowstone as well as the frank churchriver of no return 
wilderness in central idaho 
the study put together with comments from wolf experts 
worldwide and researchers from three universities predicts little 
impact on wildlife or livestock near yellowstone if wolves are 
returned 
however it speculates that some wolves would head beyond 
yellowstones boundaries and have to be controlled by one means or 
another to protect livestock interests 
although some critics of the recovery plan fear wolves would 
decimate yellowstones big game herds the study said the available 
prey was at least five times greater than that which 100 wolves 
the ideal recovery population would be expected to reduce or even 
limit 
bryce dustman press secretary for us sen conrad burns 
rmont said he wasnt surprised by the reports claim that wolves 
would have little effect on wildlife or livestock 
he said it jumped out at him that the park service and fish 
and wildlife service wrote a study saying the wolf wouldnt have a 
detrimental effect on livestock or big game 
barbee acknowledged the park service supports the wolfs return 
but said the two agencies didnt manipulate the reports contents 
mcclures proposal is expected to call for three breeding pairs 
of wolves to be transplanted into the two core areas and protected 
within those areas 
the wolves would not however be protected outside those areas 
and would be managed under state law rather than the federal 
endangered species act

prime minister margaret thatcher said tuesday that 
economic sanctions against south africa should be lifted because 
president f w de klerks reforms have made them almost 
irrelevant 
answering a question in parliament from a prosouth african 
lawmaker mrs thatcher issued her most forthright call so far for 
waiving sanctions 
it came four days after de klerk met mrs thatcher in england 
during the south african presidents ninenation tour of europe 
praising de klerks integrity and courage mrs thatcher 
said he had made reforms which are irreversible which will bring 
an end to apartheid and lead to a democratic government on a 
nonracial basis 
i believe that there is no place now for sanctions and 
indeed they are almost irrelevant she said those people who 
want south africa to have a prosperous economy should not support 
sanctions in any way 
mrs thatcher has been consistently at odds with britains 
partners in the 49nation commonwealth and the 12member european 
community in opposing sanctions 
in february after de klerk released black leader nelson 
mandela mrs thatcher acted alone and lifted some minor 
restrictions 
britain now appears determined to press the community at 
meetings next month to ease sanctions the main european communisty 
embargoes are bans on the purchase of south african coal steel and 
gold coins and on new government investment 
de klerk was in switzerland on tuesday where he voiced 
confidence that support for his reform policies will lead to the 
lifting of sanctions perhaps before the end of the year 
de klerk spoke to reporters after meeting with members of the 
swiss cabinet 
he warned that failure to recognize that his country is 
inexorably on the road to a new south africa would play into 
the hands of the radicals of those who do not want a peaceful 
solution 
the time has come for the world to take off its apartheid 
glasses he said we are aiming at a situation where there 
wont be any underdogs in south africa

they were only digging for worms but 
three boys came up with pay dirt instead when they found what 
appears to be a rare honus wagner baseball card dating back to the 
early 1900s 
the card featuring the pittsburgh pirates hall of fame 
shortstop also known as the flying dutchman was found dry and 
in good condition with the colors still bright and corners neat 
and square said arlo quint 12 
the boys raced to a collectors shop and compared the card 
against a reprint and it appeared to be genuine the boy said 
tuesday 
i cant believe it said quint who found the card monday 
if proven authentic it could be worth 10000 or more an 
expert said 
the boy said he will probably sell the card and share the 
profits with his family and chris deck and eric love both 13 who 
were looking for fishing worms with quint when he unearthed a 
small bent toothpowder can that also contained three other cards 
quint said the boys cant make out whose pictures are depicted 
on the other cards wagner a baseball legend who played for the 
pittsburgh pirates from 1897 to 1917 posted a 329 lifetime 
batting average 
quint has been collecting baseball cards since he was 5 and has 
about 5000 cards in his collection 
a wagner card in real good shape is worth 100000 said 
brad shaw of the fussbudget sportscards center in augusta 
even one in rough shape is worth 10000 to 15000 
although it could fetch more at auction shaw said tuesday 
the card discovered by quint was thought to have been 
distributed in 1909 by the piedmont tobacco co 
wagner a teetotaler who did not smoke demanded that the 
tobacco company cease publishing his card because he said it 
implied an endorsement shaw said no more than 50 wagner cards 
remain intact 
coincidentally another honus wagner card was discovered about 
30 miles away in stockton springs about a month ago

victorious presidential candidate ion 
iliescu today offered to form a coalition with losing parties but 
one opposition leader ruled out the idea and another said he 
planned to challenge the vote 
hundreds of angry antigoverment demonstrators camped out in 
downtown bucharest today chased sever georgescu a senior 
government official and forced him to seek shelter in a hotel 
the government sent georgescu to speak to 24 hunger strikers 
and as he left protesters surrounded him shouting you thieves 
you stole the revolution and we want free elections he 
escaped unharmed 
state radio urged the public to help police find people who were 
circulating leaflets calling for a demonstration against voting 
fraud in language reminiscent of former leader nicolae ceausescus 
terms for opponents the radio described the protest organizers as 
badintentioned elements 
at least two western european observer groups today questioned 
the legitimacy of iliescus victory in romanias first democratic 
elections in a halfcentury and the head of one group said western 
governments should refrain from granting aid to romania 
with 126 million ballots counted by this afternoon iliescu of 
the national salvation front had about 86 percent of the vote in 
the threeway presidential contest according to the central 
electoral bureau 
radu campeanu of the national liberal party had 102 percent and 
ion ratiu of the national peasants party had 38 percent more than 
85 percent of the 16 million eligible voters cast ballots 
iliescu the interim president had been heavily favored to win 
the election the charismatic 60yearold is credited with helping 
overthrow ceausescu in december and implementing measures to help 
the large peasant and working classes 
iliescu and the front are likely to become the first 
excommunists in eastern europe to triumph in the regions current 
multiparty elections 
he told the french tv network tf1 that he would support an 
investigation into the election he said any examination would show 
the front had won fairly 
iliescu said he would seek to form a coalition with the defeated 
opposition parties and would offer his opponents representation in 
the government based on their electoral showing 
i would like to know what hes talking about ratiu told the 
associated press when asked about the possibility of a coalition 
i havent had any approach from anybody 
campeanu ruled out a coalition with the front saying minority 
views could not possibly be heard in a government overwhelmingly 
dominated by one party 
ratiu made the fraud charge as early results showed him lagging 
far behind iliescu a former communist in the voting for president 
we will contest the election if this is the sort of result 
that we get ratiu told a news conference we will ask for them 
to be considered null and void we will ask for new elections 
a national liberal party official also claimed the election was 
marred by fraud 
we will demand the outcome of these elections be declared 
void said sorin botez the partys foreign relations secretary 
the front has won the elections but apparently it definitely 
alienated several million voters the romania libera newspaper 
said in an editorial 
it said the country had lost the chance to have a genuine 
political opposition in parliament 
in the race for seats in the twochamber parliament electoral 
bureau results based on 126 million votes gave the front about 68 
percent the liberals about 73 percent the peasants 22 percent 
the ecological movement 25 percent 
the hungarian democratic union received about 73 percent 
apparently winning broad allegiance from romanias 2 million ethnic 
hungarians the other votes went to tiny parties 
the official us government observer gov garrey e carruthers 
of new mexico called the poll a good election and a very 
giant step toward democracy 
but austrian parliamentarian andreas khol general secretary of 
the european democratic union disagreed these were a big step 
toward free and democratic elections but they were no free and no 
democratic elections said khol whose conservative political 
group also is supported by britain and west germanys governing 
parties 
the european parliament observer delegation said the results 
could be accepted but the contest could not be viewed as a normal 
election by western standards 
if the results are confirmed this doesnt seem to be the 
result of a pluralist system and this worries me said adelaide 
aglietta a lawmaker from italys green party 
various observer groups reported instances of ballots 
prestamped for iliescu front members accompanying elderly voters 
into the booth nonregistered voters casting ballots and 
individuals voting several times

the national transportation safety board 
recommended tuesday that children now flying free in parents arms 
be required to sit in separate safety seats on airliners 
all objects must be secured during takeoff and landing 
including coffee pots and luggage said board chairman james 
kolstad and yet infants our precious children are not 
the proposal approved 40 by the ntsb does not deal with who 
will provide the seats or whether children will pay fares but if 
such a regulation takes effect airlines are expected to require 
that parents generally lug along an infant seat like the ones 
required in cars and buy a ticket if they want to be guaranteed 
passage for the child 
when planes arent full the airlines are expected to continue 
to allow infants to fly at no charge 
the recommendation now goes to the federal aviation 
administration which has resisted a mandatory rule on the grounds 
that the 5000 to 10000 youngsters under 2 years old who fly in 
adults laps each day are not at great risk the faa is not 
required to follow ntsb recommendations and sometimes doesnt 
under the ntsb proposal parents who arrive at the gate of a 
fully booked flight with an unticketed baby would not be allowed to 
take the child aboard they also could be denied passage with any 
small child with or without ticket if they are not carrying an 
approved car seat 
the faa has said it will consider mandatory restraints but has 
proposed only to require that airlines allow seats on board if 
passengers chose to use them a practice now followed by most 
airlines 
the airline industry flight attendants union consumer safety 
groups and some members of congress all have called for mandatory 
restraints 
some travel agents are among opponents of the measure who say it 
would add to the cost of flying for young families and possibly 
force them to travel by automobile on shorter routes they say 
automobile travel poses greater risks per mile than flying 
a harvard medical school statistical study in the early 1980s 
theorized that three infants might be saved over five years if all 
children used safety seats on airliners 
but two recent crashes in which unrestrained infants were killed 
have led to more support for mandatory restraints two of the five 
unsecured children aboard united flight 232 that crashed in iowa 
last july died and at least one unseated child was killed aboard 
the avianca airliner that crashed in new york in january 
the ntsb proposal would prevent children under 40 inches or 40 
pounds from flying without car seats approved for airliner use 
the safety board proposal in keying on size and weight of the 
child rather than age also could lead to required seats for small 
children older than 2 who now are allowed to use ordinary seat 
belts said board senior investigator nora marshall 
the board also called for a study to develop a more effective 
restraint for children just over 40 pounds or 40 inches tall who 
may not be fully protected by ordinary seat belts 
it seems time to provide protection for those children who up 
until now have been unprotected said kolstad after the board 
vote 
asked if the possible increased cost for travelers could be 
justified kolstad said i dont think the cost of protecting an 
infants life is too much to ask 
he said the practice of allowing infants to fly in parents laps 
is a hole in the law an oversight we think needs to be 
corrected

members of the united auto workers wont 
ratify new contracts this fall unless they include costofliving 
protection for retirees benefits a local union leader warns 
but about 2000 delegates attending a threeday uaw bargaining 
convention today rejected an effort this morning to call for such 
inflation adjustments in a resolution 
a procedural motion to introduce the resolution fell short of 
the needed 329 votes on a show of hands 
alex wassell of local 1776 in willow run mich said he was 
disappointed that his move didnt work he said he didnt believe 
uaw president owen biebers statement that the issue would be 
carried to bargaining tables this summer anyway 
in his opening speech monday bieber outlined a fivepoint 
bargaining plan for contracts to be negotiated this summer with 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp it called 
for inflation protection for hundreds of thousands of retirees but 
bieber declined to say exactly how retiree benefits should be 
protected 
he said i can tell you absolutely that we will achieve the 
goals we all share of improving current benefit levels and ensuring 
that those gains are protected against inflation in future years 
for the first time in 11 years uaw contracts with the big three 
expire at the same moment midnight sept 14 contract talks 
begin after independence day 
in the past company executives and union officials have said 
costofliving adjustments or colas could be extremely expensive 
and could trigger benefit cuts for active workers cola backers say 
lumpsum payments have been eaten up by inflation 
jerry melillo a local president at fords cleveland engine 
plant warned we have to come back with cola in 90 to get 
ratification of the agreements 
inflation protection for retirees is attracting more attention 
in the union for several reasons the average age of uaw members at 
the big three automakers is about 45 and many workers are 
approaching retirement 
also there are nearly as many retirees as active workers the 
uaw contracts with the big three cover about 500000 workers 
bieber ticked off a list of priorities topping the list as 
expected is job and income security followed by wage and benefit 
increases maintenance of health care benefits help for retirees 
and more responsible management

the army used an awards ceremony at 
fort bragg to take the wraps off a secret bargebased helicopter 
unit that has been operating in the persian gulf for 2 years 
the unit task force 118 will soon become part of the 82nd 
airborne division said lt col ed hughes the units commander 
were glad we can talk about it now hughes said 
twentyfive members were honored monday for their roles in 
creating the unit developing its equipment and for action in the 
persian gulf against iranian gunboats 
chief warrant officer gregory hunter odum was responsible for 
creating or finding much of the sophisticated equipment used by the 
unit in its secret missions hughes said 
odum said most of the equipment was modified from what is 
normally used by the military although some was bought 
commercially the commercial equipment included an underwater 
breathing bottle and 30foot caving ladders light aluminum rollup 
wire ladders that can be suspended below a helocpter and used for 
picking up downed crews 
the unit uses heavily modified oh58d helicopters the most 
sophisticated and advanced helicopter in the army today odum 
said 
originally designed as a light unarmed scout helicopter the 
oh58 was upgraded in the mid1980s with improved night observation 
equipment that gives the helicopter a distinctive ball on top of 
the rotor 
the armed version of the helicopter was developed in less than 
four months when the navy asked for help escorting tankers in the 
persian gulf the navys shipboard helicopters do not have 
comparable nightfighting equipment 
in addition to 275inch rockets the armed oh58d can carry 
pods on pylons on each side the helicopter that are armed with 
hellfire airtosurface missiles stinger antiaircraft missiles or 
50caliber machine guns odum said 
the twoman flight crews fly almost exclusively at night with 
nightvision equipment and mostly over water the most difficult 
conditions to fly with nightvision equipment 
we had to keep our guys rotated out regularly to reduce the

here are some facts and figures on the republic of yemen which 
was created tuesday by the merger of north yemen and south yemen 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the land yemen spans 203645 square miles on the southwestern 
edge of the arabian peninsula and has borders with saudi arabia and 
oman the country controls the bab almandab strait the strategic 
gateway to the red sea the north is mainly mountainous with a 
narow coastal strip on the red sea the south has a sandy coastline 
along the gulf of aden backed by barren mountains 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the people yemen has 11 million people they are mainly 
tribal and the main religion is sunni islam a few hundred jews 
live in the north and there are small communities of christians 
and hindus in the south 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the economy yemen is among the poorest nations in the world 
but newly discovered oil reserves could change that unofficial 
estimates say the reserves could amount to as much as 2 billion 
barrels 
the south depended heavily on aid from the soviet bloc but the 
collapse of communism in eastern europe apparently prompted the 
south to drop its marxist policies and agreed to a merger the 
major activities in the south are the refinery of aden the citys 
port and fishing 
money from millions of yemenis working outside their country 
mainly in the oilrich gulf and from foreign aid helped prop up 
the economy of the conservative prowestern north for years 
farming is the main activity in the region and crops include 
wheat sorghum coffee tobacco and cotton 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
history by merging the north and south regained their former 
status as part of ancient arabia felix and the kingdom of sheba 
that lasted for 800 years until the 2nd century bc 
for the next 800 years it was ruled by the himyarites one of 
the earliest arab tribes then by ethiopians and persians until 
islam arrived in the 7th century 
in 1517 south yemen became part of the ottoman empire britain 
seized aden in 1839 and the surrounding territory later became a 
british protectorate 
aden won independence in 1967 after a terrorist campaign and 
south yemen became the arab worlds only selfproclaimed marxist 
state 
the northern country the yemen arab republic was established 
in 1962 after an egyptianbacked revolution ousted the saudi

prosecutors asked a judge today to change the 
wording of an indictment against an art gallery displaying robert 
mapplethorpe photographs so it would conform to obscenity standards 
set by the us supreme court 
hamilton county municipal judge david albanese said he would 
consider the request and would see the exhibit before it closes 
saturday at the contemporary arts center 
frank h prouty jr the senior assistant city prosecutor said 
the city wants the indictment to specify that photographs in the 
exhibit include a lewd graphic exhibition of the genitals 
that wording would make the indictment conform to a supreme 
court decision establishing criteria for obscenity 
the 175photo exhibition includes five photos of sex acts and 
two photos of nude children the indictment issued on april 7 
refers to the two childrens genitals only as being exposed 
h louis sirkin the art gallerys lawyer said he will oppose 
the citys request because the judge should not have the power to 
alter a grand jurys indictment 
sirkin has asked the judge to dismiss the charges arguing that 
mapplethorpes photographs are legitimate works of art he also 
contends that authorities unfairly singled out the gallery and its 
director for prosecution 
the gallery and director dennis barrie are charged with 
pandering obscenity and using children in material involving 
nudity both misdemeanors 
if convicted both face 6000 in fines and barrie faces six 
months in jail 
more than 67000 people have seen the exhibit since it opened 
april 6 with a showing to members only it opened to the public the 
next day when the indictment was returned 
sirkin raised his arguments against the charges in motions filed 
friday 
he called ohios obscenity statute vague and said grand jurors 
may not have been told that the us supreme court has ruled that 
pictures found to have artistic value cant be ruled obscene 
for any one of the issues raised in the motions i think the 
case should be dismissed sirkin said i think the most 
important are the selective prosecution and the motion to dismiss 
based on lack of prior judicial determination of probable cause 
sirkins motion notes that prosecutors took no action against 
cincinnatis taft museum for earlier displaying some of the 
pictures mentioned in the indictment 
the photographs also are available in books at the hamilton 
county library and at the university of cincinnati the motion 
says it also notes that the tylerdavidson fountain a downtown 
landmark includes a statue of a nude boy

congress is going after the gasoline in your 
cars fuel tank as lawmakers try to clean up the nations 
smogclogged air 
what the fuel of the future will be is unclear but one thing 
seems certain something other than conventional gasoline will run 
the car of the late 90s 
tougher auto pollution controls that will be included in clear 
air legislation now before congress for the first time not only 
requires new control technology on automobiles but demands that 
oil companies change the chemistry of their gasoline so the fuel 
burns cleaner 
smogcausing pollutants will be reduced as will toxic emissions 
the bills also are being crafted to open the way for an array of 
gasoline alternatives including alcohol fuel blends such as 
methanol and ethanol and in some cases pure methanol compressed 
natural gas or propane 
proponents of the various fuels are lobbying intensely for 
provisions that might give them an edge 
the oil industry has spent 1 million in recent months for a 
thusfar unsuccessful effort to thwart provisions that could 
require ethanol blended gasoline in some of the largest cities that 
account for more than a fifth of the nations gasoline market 
the legislation already approved by the senate and a similar 
version coming to a vote this week in the house will require that 
gasoline meet tougher emission standards 
the petroleum industry hopes to meet those requirements by 
reworking the gasolines chemistry so that aromatics the chemicals 
that boost octane are replaced by cleaner additives 
some oil companies including arco and shell already have begun 
selling reformulated gasoline in some limited markets 
some members of congress say that doesnt go far enough 
a compromise agreement announced in the house this week requires 
even cleaner fuels to be sold in areas with serious smog problems 
the provisions similar to one in the senate bill require 
reformulated gasoline to have a certain oxygen content likely to 
be achieved by adding ethanol if it is sold in nine cities with 
the greatest smog problems and in 44 cities with excessive levels 
of carbon monoxide during some months of the year 
it will not ony clean up the nations air but give credibility 
to the growing ethanol industry said rep bill richardson 
dnm sponsor of the amendment 
some estimates say the provisions could more than double the 
demand for ethanol which is made from grain 
the oil industry argues the government should not impose a 
recipe for motor fuels and has vigorously fought not only efforts 
to require the use of ethanol but also methanol another 
alternative fuel derived from natural gas 
automakers say they are developing cars that run on methanol 
blends a mixture of as much as 85 percent methanol and 15 percent 
gasoline 
however both the auto and oil industries are opposed to pushing 
too quickly the sale of vehicles that burn only fuels other than 
gasoline 
the house this week will consider an amendment to the clean air 
bill by rep henry waxman dcalif that would require automakers 
by 1997 to build 1 million cars a year powered by a fuel other than 
gasoline and sell them in the nine cities with the worst smog 
problems 
those cities are los angeles chicago houston san diego 
philadelphia baltimore new york city hartford conn and 
milwaukee 
president bush made a similar suggestion a year ago but the 
white house backed away from the production mandate under intense 
pressure from the auto industry attempts to impose such a mandate 
failed in the senate but both environmentalists and auto lobbyists 
say the house vote could be close 
the aim is to cut total smogcausing emissions from those cars 
by 75 percent a requirement the auto industry says can only be 
achieved by making cars that run either entirely on methanol or on 
compressed natural gas 
the automakers have vigorously fought a production requirement 
for alternative fuel cars fearful that consumers may not buy them 
because of concern about reliability and the availability of fuels 
were talking about 30 or 40 percent of the vehicles sold in 
the nine cities its a preposterous notion said robert 
liberatore a lobbyist for the chrysler corp 
oil companies fear losing market share in a 100 billion annual 
gasoline business to the natural gas industry if the congress 
requires production of cars that cant meet emission standards by 
burning even reformulated gasoline

the house voted 40320 today for legislation 
prohibiting discrimination against disabled americans 
the americans with disabilities act goes to house and senate 
negotiators after the memorial day recess to work out the one major 
difference in the two versions 
the difference is a house amendment passed 199187 last week 
to let employers reassign aidsinfected workers to keep them from 
handling food 
opponents say the amendment would allow discrimination against 
one group of people despite overwhelming medical evidence that aids 
is not transmitted through such casual contact 
president bush has urged speedy passage of the bill aimed at 
doing for disabled americans what the civil rights act of 1964 set 
out to do for blacks and other minorities guarantee access to 
jobs businesses services transportation and telecommunications 
supporters say at least one american in six 43 million is 
disabled 
prior to passage the house 227192 to defeat an amendment 
limiting the remedies disabled workers could seek from employers 
who willfully discriminate the white house supported that 
amendment 
among key provisions of the bill 
discrimination in hiring and on the job would be prohibited 
the requirement would be phased in over two to four years 
depending on the size of the company companies with fewer than 15 
employees would be exempt 
hotels restaurants shopping malls drug stores and business 
and professional offices along with any other public 
accommodation would have to make themselves accessible to 
disabled people accessibility includes structural adjustments 
such as wheelchair ramps and widened doors and services 
transportation public and private would have to be made 
accessible fixedroute bus systems would have to be accessible for 
people with wheelchairs special facilities would be available for 
people with other disabilities who cannot use regular transit 
amtrak greyhound and commuter rail systems are covered 
timetables for implementation vary according to system 
people with speech and hearing impairments would have access 
to telephone service by means of relay services these services 
would have to be provided by phone companies within three years

a woman who accused journalist hunter s 
thompson of sexual assault leveled allegations of drug abuse 
against the writer during a court hearing today 
the testimony from gail palmerslater 35 came during a 
pretrial hearing for thompson who faces five felonies and three 
misdeamor charges 
ms palmerslater of port huron mich testified that she saw 
thompson plunge his nose into a pile of white powder at his 
secluded mountain home and later boast of a ready supply of cocaine 
she testified thompson never offered her drugs and admitted 
under crossexamination that she had no proof the white powder 
actually was cocaine 
thompson was fidgety during the morning testimony and at times 
leaned over to one of his attorneys and whispered loudly bull 
thats bull 
thompson 53 was charged after the alleged sexual attack in 
february prompted a twoday search of his home that turned up 
narcotics and dynamite 
his fight against the charges was expected to hinge on questions 
about the validity of the the extensive search 
the writer whose chronicle of the hells angels accounts of 
political campaigns and shark hunts in hawaii vaulted him to 
literary stardom in the 1960s and 1970s pleaded innocent to the 
three misdemeanor charges april 9 
at the hearing pitkin county district judge charles buss was to 
evaluate evidence behind the five felony charges including three 
drug possession counts one charge of using cocaine and one charge 
of possessing explosives 
thompsons defense was expected to question the validity of the 
extensive search 
the misdemeanors include thirddegree sexual assault 
thirddegree simple assault and possession of marijuana 
the charges stem from a complaint by ms palmerslater a 
businesswoman and former xrated movie actress who claimed 
thompson threw a drink at her twisted her breast and shoved her 
during a visit to his home on feb 21 she contended that he became 
angry when she refused to conduct a business discussion in his hot 
tub 
thompson claims he never assaulted the woman he told reporters 
the woman was drunk and allegedly was pressuring him to have sex 
with her when he pushed her away 
searches feb 26 and feb 27 resulted from her complaint police 
say they found a small amount of cocaine more than an ounce of 
marijuana 39 lsd tablets the tranquilizer diazepam four sticks 
of dynamite and several blasting caps 
thompson who lives in nearby woody creek could receive a 
maximum of 16 years if convicted of all eight charges deputy 
district attorney charles mccrory has said the writer is free on 
2000 bond 
i stand for everything they dont like thompson said as he 
left the courthouse april 9 its a witch hunt 
supporters who created the hunter s thompson legal defense fund 
bought a fullpage advertisement the same day in the aspen times 
daily that reads beware today the doctor tomorrow you 
thompson whose lifestyle and exploits inspired the character 
duke in the doonesbury comic strip ran unsuccessfully for 
pitkin county sheriff in 1970 
his news columns magazine articles and books are written in a 
style dubbed gonzo journalism because they include seemingly 
exaggerated accounts of his own rowdy behavior brought on by drug 
and alcohol abuse

president bushs expected call for renewal of 
major trade benefits for china brought sharp rebukes tuesday from 
lawmakers objecting to chinas humanrights policies 
republican leaders braced for a major new chinapolicy battle 
after bush told them he planned to act within the next day or two 
im not sure id like to have that vote come up this 
afternoon house minority leader bob michel rill said he told 
the president at a morning white house meeting 
bush narrowly won a bruising veto fight with congress last 
winter over a bill extending visas for chinese students 
michel who supports extension of the mostfavorednation trade 
benefits said he believed the administration could overcome any 
attempt by congress to block such a move since that would take 
twothirds majorities of both the house and senate but he added 
we havent really taken a good temperature of the house yet on 
that 
senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said bush would propose a oneyear extension of the 
mostfavorednation preferential tariff treatment for beijing 
within the next few days 
the declaration would contain some conditions spellins republic 
will ever be satisfied by anything he does 
not all republicans supported bushs apparent decision to renew 
trade benefits 
rep mickey edwards rokla chairman of the republican policy 
committee and one of the gop members who met with bush tuesday 
said hes opposed to extension of mostfavorednation status for 
china 
i know the president thinks he has good reason but im 
bothered by the idea of granting special treatment to china he 
said 
edwards said china has cracked down more not less on human 
rights since tiananmen square 
administration officials and gop leaders said that they did not 
think that a battle over the mostfavorednation issue would be as 
emotional as last winters fight ultimately won by bush over 
chinese students 
by a single vote the senate sustained bushs veto of a bill to 
extend the visas of chinese students in the united states bush 
argued that he was offering the chinese students the same safe 
haven through administrative actions 
on tuesday the independent federation of chinese students and 
scholars asked bush to suspend chinas mostfavorednation status 
to demonstrate us commitment to democracy and human rights in 
china 
a letter signed by three students in the group said we hope 
you will agree with us that the united states cannot continue 
business as usual relationships with the current regime 
the federation says it represents some 40000 students at more 
than 200 universities in the united states

the navys shipbuilding budget would have to 
remain at its current level of about 11 billion annually for the 
service to maintain a pareddown fleet of 488 ships congressional 
analysts said tuesday 
members of the congressional budget office told a senate panel 
that the navys publicly stated goal for 1990 is 547 ships 
including 14 aircraft carriers four battleships and 34 ballistic 
missile submarines 
but recent published reports said civilian and military leaders 
drafted spending plans that suggest 488 ships including 12 
aircraft carriers 
such a fleet would require a shipbuilding budget that on 
average stays constant at todays level in real terms robert 
hale told the senate armed services subcommittee on projection 
forces and regional defense 
the shipbuilding budget for 1990 totals 114 billion the cbo 
said 
the navys proposed cut in its fleet comes in response to 
defense secretary dick cheneys orders to the service chiefs to cut 
spending by 2 percent below the rate of inflation in each year from 
1992 to 1997 
reductions in the fleet creates a need for the navy to 
reconsider its missions the cbo said 
if it has fewer ships the navy could reduce capability to 
perform each of its missions proportionately hale said that 
might mean proportional reductions in submarines that provide 
strategic deterrence ships that provide power projection by 
attacking targets on land and ships that provide sea control 
questioned by lawmakers about the navys priorities gerald 
cann an assistant secretary of the navy declined to provide 
specifics but noted cheneys current review of the planned purchase 
of the seawolf ssn21 submarine and the ddg51 guidedmissile 
destroyer 
cann also said the negotiations on the services spending plans 
submitted to cheney on may 1 will address the character and size 
of the navy 
when all is said and done we are still a maritime nation

the united states wants a new 
attackproof embassy compound in kuwait but acquiring one is 
turning out to be a diplomatic headache 
the present compound bounded by a hotel and the waters of the 
persian gulf has been deemed a security risk also the landlord 
does not want to renew the lease 
but replacing it could cost 32 million for the land alone a 
price tag that is raising eyebrows in washington relocation 
efforts are further complicated by kuwaits ban on real estate 
purchases by foreigners 
the compound which contains the ambassadors residence and the 
embassy was fortified after shiite moslem terrorists rammed a 
bombladen truck into its gates in december l983 
despite safeguards including concrete blockades and a high 
barbedwire fence that is electrified at some points security is 
not exactly airtight said an arab diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the site was rented in the early 1950s from a landlord who is a 
ruling emir of one of the gulf states according to sources now a 
boom has driven the lands value up to an estimated 13 million 
and the landlord has given notice that the lease will not be 
renewed when it expires in 1995 
some lawmakers say even if the lease werent coming up security 
concerns alone would justify a new mission 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on international operations recently traveled 
to kuwait 
he told a congressional panel the compound is a ripe target 
for terrorist activities and that he would have had a clear shot 
at the no 2 embassy official from his hotel room 
kuwait is significant to the united states on several counts 
and the embassys job reflects that its staff of 80 people about 
half of them military is the secondlargest us diplomatic 
mission in the persian gulf region after riyadh saudi arabia 
kuwait is involved in an issue of key importance to the united 
states that of western hostages in lebanon the release of 15 
proiranian convicts held in kuwaiti jails is one of the 
proiranian kidnappers demands 
the 15 were jailed for their role in bombings of the us and 
french embassies along with the international airport and other 
public utilities in kuwait in 1983 
in addition five kuwaiti oil tankers fly the american flag a 
protection extended to 11 of kuwaits 22 usregistered tankers 
during the iraniraq war when attacks on gulf shipping were made 
by both sides 
kuwait is also a major oil supplier and an importer of 
usbuild warplanes and military hardware 
whenever possible the state department prefers to own rather 
than rent embassy compounds but technically no foreigners are 
allowed to buy real estate in kuwait under laws that took effect 
after independence in 1961 
diplomats reached by telephone in kuwait said it was not clear 
if the government would bend the rules and grant the americans 
dispensation to buy land even if they do the state department 
says land costs in kuwait are among the worlds highest and the 
necessary 14 acres would run about 32 million 
despite the obstacles negotiations are apparently still in 
progress 
state department lawyers and other experts have been quietly 
traveling to kuwait to check out prospective property and work on 
other details 
through it all the embassy is maintaining a diplomatic silence 
embassy public affairs officer alberto fernandez declined to make 
any statement 
were not allowed to comment on these matters he said

the peace corps nearly 30 years after its 
founding by president john f kennedy suffers from lingering 
perceptions it is a white middleclass institution congress was 
told tuesday 
only about 7 percent of the agencys roughly 6300 volunteers 
are minorities a congressional investigative agency found and 
through 1988 no minorities held any of the top 20 management jobs 
at the agency 
efforts to improve the peace corps minority profile in the 
past have been shortlived and costly the general accounting 
office said it called for a longterm strategy to correct the 
problem 
the underrepresentation of minorities in the peace corps has 
made it difficult for the agency to teach foreign peoples about the 
racially diverse american culture the study said 
congressional researchers acknowledged however that the peace 
corps has historically experienced great difficulty attracting 
sufficient number of minorities to serve as volunteers 
part of the problem stems from the lower economic status of 
blacks and other minorities the study said who believe that 
they cannot afford to volunteer two years of their lives to peace 
corps service 
but it said that minorities also tend to see the peace corps 
as a white middleclass organization 
rep john conyers dmich chairman of a house government 
operations subcommittee examining the peace corps program said the 
agency must work toward better portraying the united states to 
the people of the beneficiary countries by providing opportunities 
to ethnic and racial groups which would represent the amalgamation 
of our many rich cultures 
the gao report released as the house panel held a public 
hearing also said the agency was failing to meet a 1985 
congressional mandate to build its volunteer force to 10000 
during its heyday the peace corps in the mid1960s had a 
volunteer force as high as 16000 and a 114 million annual budget 
but the agency was given less money and saw its volunteer force 
shrink to 5000 at the start of the 1980s 
by this fall the gao report said the agency expects to have 
6700 volunteers in 76 countries 
several lawmakers noted that president bush sought a 9 percent 
increase in the agencys fiscal 1991 budget but they said more 
will be needed if the peace corps is to move people swiftly into 
eastern europe while continuing a heavy presence in third world 
nations 
if we expect the peace corps to meet the challenges and 
increasing responsibilities ahead then we need to ensure that the 
appropriate resources are available for the agency to realize its 
goals said conyers 
sen christopher dodd dconn a former peace corps volunteer 
who appeared as a witness before the subcommittee said the agency 
has received requests for volunteers from hungary poland 
czechoslovakia romania and east germany 
the peace corps needs the resources to respond to these 
requests from eastern europe he said but it cannot rob other 
parts of the world to accommodate an area of the world to which the 
peace corps has not previously been invited

hundreds of hezbollah members burned 
effigies of the israeli prime minister as well as the us 
jordanian and saudi arabian leaders to protest the weekend slaying 
of palestinian laborers by an israeli 
with shouts of the spiteful america is the cause of the 
worlds misfortunes the crowd wound its way past garbage piles 
in the dusty alleys of beiruts southern suburbs 
the proiranian hezbollah or party of god is believed to be 
the umbrella group for extremist shiite moslem factions who hold 
most of the 16 foreign hostages in lebanon 
the march came three days after an israeli gunman killed seven 
unarmed palestinian workers near tel aviv 
an israeli judge ordered psychiatric tests for the suspect ami 
popper israeli police said the gunman was deranged and upset 
over a breakup with his girlfriend but arabs accused the israeli 
government of creating an atmosphere that led to the slayings 
both the zionist entity and world arrogance committed the 
massacre in the name of a madman said hezbollah cleric sheik 
naim kassem 
the demonstration was led by a group of boys aged eight to 13 
carrying pictures of irans late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini pasted 
on pieces of cardboard they also carried colorful flags inscribed 
we are at your disposal oh khomeini 
schools and businesses in the palestinian refugee camps in the 
southern ports of sidon and tyre went on strike to protest the 
killings 
about 125 palestinians visited the international committee of 
the red cross in tyre and asked the organization to relay a message 
to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar the message 
demanded intervention by the icrc and the un to stop the 
massacres committed against our people in the occupied 
territories

mikhail s gorbachev took another step toward 
dialogue with the baltics on tuesday by meeting with the estonian 
and latvian presidents but he stuck to his hard line against 
independence reports said 
lithuania struggling with an economic blockade the kremlin 
imposed to weaken its independence campaign said gasoline sales 
for private cars would be banned as of wednesday 
the soviet president who met last week with lithuanias prime 
minister sat down for 20 minutes with presidents anatoly gorbunov 
of latvia and arnold ruutel of estonia the estonian news service 
reported 
gorbachev reportedly told the latvian and estonian leaders the 
same thing he told lithuanias kazimiera prunskiene the baltic 
republics must either suspend or revoke their declarations of 
independence 
the estonian news service an independent information agency 
quoted ruutel as saying there was a common understanding of the 
need for dialogue but he characterized the meeting as 
unpleasant for both sides 
he did not elaborate but told interfax another independent news 
service that each side stuck to its opinion and refused to budge 
lithuania latvia and estonia are in varying stages of efforts 
to restore the independence they enjoyed before the soviet union 
forcibly annexed them 50 years ago the kremlin has declared the 
independence declarations illegal it imposed a blockade of oil 
gas and other supplies on lithuania which led the independence 
movement with its march 11 declaration 
at the kremlin meeting tuesday gorbachev repeated his view that 
the baltics independence declarations violate the soviet 
constitution the estonian report said 
elsewhere in the kremlin a lithuanian legislator told one of 
the two chambers of the supreme soviet that the blockade against 
his republic is not only immoral but illegal eduardas vilkas 
said the sanctions had cost lithuania a quarter of a billion rubles 
in lost production but had also cost the soviet union several 
billion rubles in lithuanian products it did not receive he 
demanded the blockade be lifted and his republic be compensated 
legislators in lithuania debated measures on holding the economy 
together during the blockade as well as an approach toward moscow 
the parliaments information bureau reported no decisions were 
made 
so far lithuanian lawmakers have refused to suspend the 
independence decree but have offered to consider rescinding other 
measures aimed at implementing the declaration 
starting wednesday gasoline will be sold in lithuania only for 
ambulances police cars fire trucks food trucks armored cars 
hearses and agricultural equipment algirdas brazauskas head of 
the governments antiblockade committee told parliament some gas 
will be available for limited public transport brazauskas said 
private cars had been limited to 2 gallons a month 
brazauskas also announced what he called one of the most 
difficult decisions in these days that small oil and coalfired 
power plants would be closed starting thursday because of the fuel 
shortage 
at a seminar in stockholm on baltic independence lithuanian 
vice president ceslovas stankevicius said townspeople may be 
evacuated to the countryside to conserve energy and food he said 
22000 people had lost their jobs because of the monthold embargo 
a strike by promoscow forces in estonia was in its second day 
with workers at two more plants joining the protest against the 
republics independence drive a strike committee spokesman said 
the tass news agency said the strike spread to coal mines 
shipyards and the krengolmskaya manufacturing mills the republics 
largest light industry enterprise 
tass said 21 businesses were on strike 
the strikers demanded ruutel resign and the parliament rescind 
laws challenging soviet authority said viktor tsunya a member of 
the antiindependence russian strike committee 
tass said the workers want promoscow legislators to set up an 
alternate government 
finnish radio reported a strike among members of estonia ethnic 
russian minority had prompted the owners of the baltic ferry boat 
georg ots to suspend service between the finnish capital of 
helsinki and tallinn the estonian capital 
an assistant us commerce department secretary said the bush 
administration hopes the soviet union will end its economic 
blockade of lithuania and begin a productive dialogue with the 
lithuanian people 
the official thomas j duesterberg was in moscow for talks

the hardline policies of prime minister 
yitzhak shamir have created an atmosphere of hatred that incites 
antiarab violence such as the slaying of seven palestinian workers 
by an israeli palestinians say 
they charge that israels iron fist handling of the 
29monthold palestinian uprising and the governments failure to 
begin peace talks have increased antiarab sentiment 
in addition israelis who attack palestinians face lenient 
punishment palestinian leaders said 
there is no doubt that the israeli government led by shamir 
leads to such catastrophe proplo leader faisal husseini 
said after the slayings sunday of seven unarmed palestinian workers 
by an israeli civilian the atmosphere created by such a 
government is responsible 
but shamir and his supporters have said sundays violence was 
the act of a deranged man they also accused palestinian extremists 
of using the massacre to rekindle the flagging rebellion against 
israeli rule of the west bank and gaza strip 
anyone wishing to see in this mad murder an expression of 
israeli government policy and intentions is maliciously and 
viciously distorting the picture shamir told parliament members 
from his rightwing likud bloc at a meeting tuesday 
he pledged that his government would pursue peace efforts in the 
middle east but said we dont want to live by our sword but we 
shall not be quick in throwing it out as long as it allows us to 
live in security 
shamir has headed a caretaker government since the likudlabor 
party coalition collapsed march 15 over labors insistance on 
negotiations with the palestians 
benjamin netanyahu israels deputy foreign minister said the 
us state departments call for restraint in handling the 
palestinian riots that followed the massacre was understandable 
but unwarranted 
i think the us government and american people understand 
that this was a tragedy we had nothing to do with and that we are 
doing everything we can to restore tranquility netanyahu said 
he accused the palestine liberation organization and other 
palestinian groups of fanning the flames and sustaining the 
violence 
thirteen palestinians have been killed by israeli troops in 
three days of rioting most in the occupied gaza strip more than 
800 others have been injured 
their deaths raised to 708 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians since the start of the uprising in 
december 1987 fortythree israelis have died in the violence 
ami popper 21 a cashiered israeli army soldier has been 
arrested for sundays fatal shootings of seven gaza workers in 
rishon lezion near tel aviv an israeli court ordered that he 
undergo psychiatric observation 
saeed kanaan a leading proplo businessman from the west bank 
said the violence that followed the rishon lezion killings was not 
orchestrated by palestinian leaders

a ranch owned by actress greer garson would be 
combined with the 385acre pecos national monument to make a new 
national park near sante fe nm under legislation approved 
tuesday by the house 
the legislation which passed 4150 also would preserve about 
15000 ancient indian rock carvings by creating the petroglyph 
national monument near albuquerque nm 
garsons 5500acre forked lightning ranch went on sale after 
the death of her husband texas oilman ee buddy fogelson 
environmentalists and residents of the area became involved when 
she began transactions with a developer who wanted to commercialize 
the area 
its extremely important that we act quickly said rep bill 
richardson dnm during debate on the bill 
garson 77 won an academy award in 1943 for the film mrs 
miniver during a career that spanned about 40 years on stage and 
in the movies 
she and her husband who died last year made their home at the 
ranch and in dallas texas 
richardson said one prospective buyer of the ranch wanted to 
build a huge commercial complex including a resort shopping mall 
air strip convention center and private hunting reserve on the 
land 
although mrs fogelson has decided against selling to these 
developers the land remains on the open market said richardson 
any development would pose a serious threat to the existing 
national monument 
the monument was established in 1965 and preserves the ruins of 
the nearly 600yearold pueblo of pecos and two spanish missions 
from the 17th and 19th centuries 
the legislation has the support of the bush administration 
it was attached by the house to a bill already passed by the 
senate which would make a national monument of ancient indian rock 
carvings known as petroglyphs 
the 15000 petroglyphs are part of the las imagines national 
archeological district on abuquerque nms west mesa escarpment 
lawmakers say the drawings are threatened by urbanization and 
vandalism and hundreds have already been destroyed 
aquisition of the land where the petroglyphs are located would 
cost about 90 million state and local governments have pledged 
30 million said rep robert lagomarsino rcalif a member of 
the house interior committee

african national congress 
leader nelson mandela accused the south african government tuesday 
of massacring demonstrators and causing blackonblack violence 
mandela also charged the government with defaming his wife 
winnie in a murder and assault trial involving one of her former 
bodyguards and said the anc is not satisfied with reforms 
introduced by president fw de klerk 
mandela speaking to reporters after returning from an 
eightnation african tour said de klerk has no control over the 
police force he accused police of slaughtering black people 
involved in political demonstrations 
he alleged it was government policy to keep anc supporters 
fighting members of the inkatha political organization in natal 
province where more than 5000 people have died in the past five 
years 
it is quite clear that the government does not want this 
violence to end mandela said if the government continues to 
massacre our people while they are talking of negotiations that we 
cannot permit we will have to address that question specifically 
in relation to whether these negotiations shall continue 
de klerk is hoping to begin formal talks with black leaders on 
constitutional changes that would give the black majority a voice 
in national affairs something denied them under the current 
system of apartheid 
since taking office in august de klerk has made a number of 
reforms including legalizing the longbanned anc freeing mandela 
from a life prison term and ending segregation of beaches and 
hospitals 
mandela said the anc is not satisfied 
we have got basic demands he said the most basic of 
these is the demand for everybody to have the right to determine 
his own affairs 
mandela said the government has deliberately besmirched his 
wifes name by linking her to the alleged crimes of one of her 
former bodyguards jerry richardson but not charging her 
richardson is charged with murder kidnapping attempted murder 
and assault eight other bodyguards are facing lesser charges in 
separate trials 
three men have testified in court that winnie mandela whipped 
them beat them allowed her bodyguards to keep them captive in her 
home and assault them in december 1988 and january 1989 one of the 
alleged victims 14yearold black activist stompie seipei 
moeketsi was found dead jan 6 1989 
mrs mandela denies wrongdoing and has not been charged with a 
crime 
when my wife is not charged and the whole case centers on her 
she has no way of defending herself mandela said 
but mandela said he was not calling on the government to 
prosecute his wife 
i am saying that the way the case has been conducted is 
intended to defame my wife without her having the opportunity to 
defend herself he said 
it was the first time mandela had spoken publicly on the matter 
in south africa since he was freed feb 12 from a life prison term 
for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the whiteminority 
government

a railroad strike in northwestern poland 
spread tuesday and the government ordered the army to transport 
people and food 
the strike began sunday and the solidarityled government of 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki continued to appeal to rail 
workers to return to work 
the solidarity leadership met in gdansk to draft a response to 
the strike organized without the unions endorsement 
the government has rejected negotiations because the strikers 
are not operating through their unions it also said that giving in 
to their pay raise demands could scuttle postcommunist polands 
economic reforms 
strikes were reported tuesday at eight key depots including 
slupsk and koszalin near the baltic coast there were warning 
strikes and support actions in other provinces but precise numbers 
of those who walked off the job were not immediately available 
the workers began striking sunday night in support of more than 
three dozen colleagues on fasts some of the hunger strikers have 
been fasting since may 10 three were reported to have been 
hospitalized and others joined the protest monday pap said 
a team of doctors dispatched tuesday by the ministry of health 
was under orders to hospitalize any other workers whose health was 
in danger 
only one rail route was open to polands busiest port in 
szczecin and mail lines were paralyzed more than 160 local 
trains 47 freight trains and 14 longdistance passenger trains 
were canceled monday the official pap news agency reported 
the government decided to use the military to transport goods 
especially perishables according to news reports 
the army and the railway authority were also directed to 
organize alternative bus and truck transport for passengers and 
goods pap said 
the strike was the most serious labor unrest since the 
prodemocratic reforms which included unpopular austerity 
measures went into effect on jan 1 the reforms have reduced 
buying power by 40 percent and cut subsidies to stateowned 
enterprises including railroads 
labor minister jacek kuron met late monday with national railway 
authorities and news reports said it was agreed that no government 
money was available to raise average pay of 79 per month that is 
close to the national average but less than the pay in many 
industries the news reports said 
the strikers are demanding their salaries be raised to 110 
percent of the national average or another 8 this month but 
these figures are adjusted monthly to keep up with inflation 
the government in trying to control inflation has rejected pay 
or benefit increases that cannot be supported by the budgets of the 
enterprises or the government 
the strike represents a challenge to solidarity which has been 
trying to define its role in society whether it should focus on 
serving as a trade union backing workers or a political party 
supporting the government 
solidarity leader lech walesa reiterated his contention that the 
government his movement created was moving too slowing with reforms 
and failing to win the understanding of working poles 
the slupsk strike committee spokesman jerzy sadka said the 
workers support mazowiecki and do not consider their action 
political we are involved in purely worker and thus trade 
union issues and we protest against pulling us into political 
affairs he said

a proposed move toward a global ban on high 
seas driftnet fishing won approval tuesday from the senate 
commerce committee and the backing of the environmental group 
greenpeace 
this legislation sends a clear signal to those using drift 
nets that the senseless destruction of marine life for profit must 
end said sen slade gorton rwash a member of the panel 
gorton and sen ted stevens ralaska cosponsored the amendment 
to the magnuson fishery management and conservation act calling for 
an end to high seas driftnet fishing by june 1992 
todays action will increase pressure on the governments of 
japan taiwan and south korea to put an end to their high seas 
driftnet fleets stevens said 
gorton said the drift nets some stretching as long as 35 miles 
are environmentally devastating 
greenpeace spokesman alan reichman of seattle said the nets 
cause large kills of dolphins porpoise northern fur seals and 
seabirds the fleets also intercept north american salmon and 
threaten the viability of albacore tuna and red flying squid 
stocks he said 
the driftnet provisions would provide new leverage to gain a 
global ban on this destructive fishing technology which is 
threatening ocean environment reichman said 
the measure establishes a congressional goal of gaining a global 
moratorium on high seas driftnet fishing through a resolution the 
united nations general assembly approved in december that 
resolution calls for the moratorium on largescale driftnet 
fishing to go into effect next year

boris n yeltsin won applause from russian 
congressional deputies on tuesday with a call to wrest control of 
the republic the soviet unions largest from the kremlin 
yeltsin a rival of soviet president mikhail gorbachev is 
seeking the presidency of the republic which includes moscow 52 
percent of the nations population and threequarters of its land 
he told the russian congress the topheavy soviet political 
system continues to cling to life though its time has passed and 
has hurt russia most of all 
yeltsins sovereignty proposal for the republic resembles 
measures passed by the three secessionist baltic republics in the 
beginning of their independence drives 
under it the republic would have final say over whether soviet 
laws and decrees are valid on its territory which stretches from 
the baltic sea to the pacific ocean the russian republic embraces 
11 time zones and the vast oil gas mineral and gold reserves 
congress was expected to vote on various sovereignty proposals 
wednesday or thursday then turn to nominations for president the 
president is chosen by the congress rather than in general 
elections 
yeltsin is running against russias premier alexander vlasov and 
several others he has said he believes about onethird of the 
congress 1059 deputies support him 
a yeltsin victory could mean a loss of face for gorbachev whose 
policies are frequently and stridently criticized by yeltsin 
yeltsin is a leader of the democratic russia bloc that made major 
inroads into local and republic councils in march elections 
the sovereignty plan outlined by yeltsin would involve allowing 
republics and businesses to set trade contracts freely among 
themselves rather than having to go through the central government 
other deputies offered more extreme proposals irina zalevskaya 
a newspaper editor from the ural mountains city of perm declared 
that russia must break from the soviet union if it wants true 
control over its own affairs 
full sovereignty requires the republics secession from the 
soviet union she said russia should eventually seek un 
membership form its own army and set up embassies in the other 14 
republics she said 
her vehement speech won hearty applause

district of columbia police warned visitors monday to stay away 
from georgetown on weekend nights because with reduced budgets 
they could not promise to prevent the violence that rocked the 
trendy nightclub strip over the weekend 
police said there was one incident in which a crowd of men 
attacked an officer trying to make an arrest and a police union 
spokesman said five officers in all were hurt in confrontations 
during the weekend 
fifty officers instead of the usual six were supposed to have 
been patrolling the area and a mobile headquarters was to have been 
set up as part of a special summer anticrime effort but police 
citing budget cuts said there wasnt enough money 
police chief isaac fulwood on tuesday reinstated the weekend 
summer anticrime patrols but shopkeepers said extra police will 
not repair the changing nature of georgetown 
its not just police that are needed one shoe store owner 
said its a whole different kind of person than the kind that 
used to shop here its too many young kids with nothing to do 
area residents say robberies and muggings have been on the 
increase for some time and shopkeepers and residents said tuesday 
they are mourning the loss of the neighborhood they sought out for 
its history vibrancy and elegance 
georgetown once a separate city still has cobblestone streets 
small row houses and sprawling mansions it has been populated by 
kennedys cabinet members and the citys most famed socialites and 
diplomats and is home to the citys most prestigious university 
but the old antique and rare book shops are gradually being 
replaced with national chain clothing stores and the nightclub and 
restaurant strip is thriving 
with those changes have come increasing numbers of youths either 
too young or too broke to shop or dine shopkeepers say those 
people have begun preying on the customers who are beginning to 
stay away 
were definitely getting a security guard said william 
myers manager of hats in the belfry which stays open until 1045 
pm we get rowdy people and im getting tired of chasing 
shoplifters down the street 
im beginning to second guess whether i want to stay said 
the manager of a sports clothing store who asked not to be named 
i would have to see major changes if i got an offer to get out 
id take it 
the last thing i want to hear is that the police are giving up 
on this area he added i spend more time being a policeman 
now chasing riffraff and shoplifters out than i do selling that 
hurts 
mehdi mokhtari owner of shoe inn said he has chased out 
children with wads of cash crumpled in their hands they came 
back later he said and sprayed his tiny store with a 
foulsmelling aerosol which kept customers away for hours 
david friedman a longtime resident who owns susquehanna 
antiques says his store will be replaced this year with an 
upscale i hate that word clothing store he said even the 
old georgetown types no longer think of the neighborhood as a 
place to find fine furniture and head for new york or boston 
instead 
others however say georgetown has faced such phases 
periodically through its history especially in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s with race riots and hippies and will survive this trend

leaders of the three baltic states 
appealed tuesday to the united states and europe for diplomatic 
recognition and economic help for their independenceminded 
republics 
with an apparent eye to the upcoming superpower summit they 
also called on president bush to suggest that the kremlin begin 
negotiations with the three republics on independence 
the call which came at the end of a twoday seminar on baltic 
independence was signed by estonian foreign minister lennart meri 
latvian vice president dainis ivans and lithuanian vice president 
ceslovas stankevicius 
the twoday seminar was arranged by swedens institute of 
foreign affairs a panel of representatives of the three baltic 
republics and the soviet union were among about 150 participating 
diplomats government officials and international law experts 
earlier lithuanias vice president said some city and town 
dwellers may be evacuated to the countryside to conserve energy and 
food 
moscow imposed a blockade of oil natural gas and raw materials 
a month ago to force the republic to back down on its march 11 
declaration of independence stankevicius said by the latest count 
22000 people were out of work because of the embargo i cannot 
say how long we can survive this situation he told the seminar 
it is a threat 
he said lithuania is establishing direct economic ties with 
other soviet republics and towns outside lithuania to get around 
the blockade 
we are ready to supply food in exchange for raw materials 
he said 
meri of estonia said his republic has made arrangements to 
receive workers from lithuania and that latvia was taking similar 
steps 
in lithuania legislators said gasoline sales to private cars 
would be banned as of wednesday because of shortages caused by the 
kremlin sanctions private cars had been limited to 2 gallons of 
gasoline a month 
the baltic leaders in stockholm appealed to the 35 countries in

an environmental protection agency study still 
under scientific review suggests that there is increasing 
scientific evidence of a link between heavy electrical currents and 
some types of cancer 
the study an epa official said tuesday shows that research 
over the last decade has established at least a tentative 
connection between leukemia and some other cancers and the slowly 
varying magnetic fields created by powerful alternating electric 
currents 
richard guimond director of epas office of radiation said the 
report has no original research but rather is a review of a 
variety of scientific studies of the human body effects of 
longterm exposure to magnetic fields created by power lines 
at one time he said studies showed no link between electrical 
current and human cancer the new report however said guimond 
suggests that there is in fact stronger and stronger evidence 
being developed as more and more of these studies are done 
over the past 10 years studies have been developed that show 
evidence of links between cancer and electrical current he said 
guimond said the epa review tries to analyze all of those studies 
to determine if there is a weak link a strong link no link 
after the report is reviewed by a group of scientists it will 
be available for public review sometime this summer probably in 
july he said 
until then he said we cant say that it is final and what 
the final conclusions are going to be 
he said an independent panel will review work done by epa 
staffers to assure that our methodology is correct and to 
give us some advice as to whether or not our evidence is strong 
enough to declare that this long term exposure to magnetic fields 
is a probable human carcinogen or not 
there have been more than two dozen studies by various 
organizations and scientists on the possible link between illness 
and the electromagnetic fields created any time an electrical 
circuit is energized though there have been findings suggestive of 
a cancer effect the link has not been universally accepted by 
scientists 
a new understanding in recent years of how individual cells can 
be affected by even very low levels of electromagnetic radiation 
however has caused a closer look at a possible link between 
electrical currents and cancer 
for instance a 1987 study in denver claimed that children 
living near electric power lines were 17 times more likely to 
develop leukemia than denver children living away from power lines 
other studies in recent years have suggested there is a higher 
incidence of leukemia and brain tumors among people exposed to 
electrical fields on the job these would include electrical power 
line and telephone line workers 
other studies have shown that even very low levels of 
electromagnetic radiation such as from ordinary household 
applicances can affect specific cells but whether or not these 
cells are actually injured remains a controversial question 
all households and almost all power lines use alternating 
current changing direction 60 times a second and producing an 
electromagnetic field varying at the same frequency only a handful 
of very high power transmission lines use direct current which 
produces a steady magnetic field

parliaments finance committee said tuesday it 
approved spending 205 million to improve jewish settlements in 
the occupied territories at the request of prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
the decision came monday after a plea from shamir who asked the 
committee in a letter to allocate the funds to the housing 
ministry a copy of shamirs letter was obtained by the associated 
press 
shamir asked that the money be used to develop settlements and 
roads beyond the green line which divides israel from the 
territories it captured in the 1967 middle east war a shamir 
spokesman insisted the money would be used only to improve existing 
settlements not build new ones 
two new settlements established by shamirs caretaker government 
have sparked protests from the united states which says 
settlements in the occupied areas are an obstacle to peacemaking 
shulamit aloni a finance committee member and leftwing 
legislator condemned the decision to allocate the money 
this decision was passed by a completely insane system at a 
time of political unrest aloni said he said it could hurt us 
aid to israel and endanger soviet jewish emigration 
thousands of soviet jews are expected to immigrate to israel 
this year and there is concern in the soviet union and among arab 
countries that some could settle in the occupied lands 
israel denies it has a policy of steering immigrants to the 
occupied territories 
a report by an israeli diplomat in washington released tuesday 
in the daily haaretz supported alonis claims 
yoram ettinger aide to deputy foreign minister benjamin 
natanyahu said the us congress appeared to be less motivated to 
maintain strategic cooperation with israel and more inclined to 
support palestinians in their struggle for statehood haaretz 
reported 
the arab states see any settlement move as an attempt to push 
out palestinians from the occupied territories 
government officials insisted that the money approved by the 
finance committee would not be used to form a new jewish presence 
in the occupied west bank or gaza strip 
we are talking about already existing settlements not forming 
new ones shamirs spokesman avi pazner said 
the allocated money included 25 million to strengthen new 
settlements and 3 million for developing and expanding existing 
settlements 
a separate sum of 25 million was allocated to purchase 
prefabricated houses and strengthen settlements in the west bank 
ariel weinstein who represents shamirs likud bloc on the 
finance committee said the government decided on a policy of 
settling the occupied territories and they should be treated as any 
other israeli town 
they need new roads schools nobody thinks the government can 
decide not to fulfill these needs weinstein said 
in egypt president hosni mubarak warned tuesday that settlement 
of soviet jewish immigrants in israelioccupied lands threatens 
new bloody confrontation in the middle east 
he spoke at the opening session of socialist international a 
nongovernmental grouping of 89 socialist parties from 47 countries

money to help developing nations phase out chemicals that damage 
the ozone layer 
the bush administration refused last month to go along with 
international efforts to help developing countries curtail the use 
of such chemicals as chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs that are 
damaging the ozone layer 
the ozone layer protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation 
under a plan floated by several european countries at a 
conference in geneva 100 million would be provided by industrial 
nations over three years 
but the assistance plan reportedly was opposed by john sununu 
white house chief of staff and richard darman director of the 
office of management and budget 
legislation introduced in the senate on tuesday would authorize 
the spending of 25 million annually for the assistance program 
over the next three years it was not known tuesday whether efforts 
would be made to specifically earmark money for such assistance in

interim president ion iliescu defeated 
the opposition in romanias election by such a large margin that 
fears were raised tuesday in his own party about entrenching 
democracy in this former communist bastion 
iliescu captured 859 percent of the vote in the threeway 
presidential race with nearly all ballots counted his national 
salvation front party had more than twothirds of the seats in the 
twochamber parliament 
the 60yearold former communist politburo member had been 
expected to win romanias first multiparty election in 53 years 
last sunday but his overwhelming victory astonished many romanians 
and foreign observers 
iliescu says he wants to turn romania into a swedishstyle 
social democracy and that he will seek a coalition with the 
opposition 
but his two opponents said they will seek to nullify the 
election on grounds of fraud and indicated it was unlikely they 
would join a national unity government 
a monthlong protest by anticommunist demonstrators in downtown 
bucharests university square flared into what almost became a 
violent confrontation with government officials who tried to 
establish a dialogue at least 4000 protesters filled the square 
tuesday night shouting the election was a fraud 
silviu brucan the fronts power behind the scenes and one of 
its campaign organizers said the turnout of more than 85 percent 
meant romanians have passed magna cum laude the first class in 
democracy 
but he said the fronts share of the vote was too high 
this is no good for democracy because i stick to my statement 
that a strong opposition is essential in a democracy particularly 
at a time when that democracy is in the making he said 
iliescu who announced communist dictator nicolae ceausescus 
execution at the climax of decembers revolution capitalized on 
his personality and his grassroots support from industrial workers 
and peasants 
in an editorial the outspoken independent daily romania libera 
said the front has won the elections but apparently it 
definitely alienated several million voters and the country has 
lost a chance the chance to have a genuine political opposition in 
parliament 
some foreign diplomats and observers monitoring the election 
said the fronts control of parliament means it could overwhelm the 
process of writing a new constitution which is to take place 
within 18 months 
if the results are confirmed this doesnt seem to be the 
result of a pluralist system and this worries me said adelaide 
aglietta a lawmaker from italys green party who was an observer 
for the european parliament 
i think people here were not helped to understand exactly what 
democracy means they still think that other political parties are 
the enemies and they havent understood what a political dialogue 
in a democracy is she told a news conference 
andreas khol leader of the european democratic union observer 
group drawing together western europes powerful conservative 
parties said in vienna the election did not give iliescu or the 
front the legitimacy of new governments in hungary or poland 
he said it was an important step toward democracy but did not 
express the free will of the romanian people 
khol said western governments should refrain from granting 
romanian aid and leave any help to private firms 
but robert waring a british lawmaker from the socialist labor 
party called the election free and fair and said when we 
get back we will tell the british government please please help 
romania with credits for investments to see that industries are 
reequipped 
with 13 million ballots counted tuesday night iliescu had 859 
percent of the vote radu campeanu of the national liberal party 
had 103 percent and ion ratiu of the national peasant party 38 
percent according to the central electoral bureau 
more than 85 percent of the 16 eligible million voters cast 
ballots authorities said 
in the senate race the front won 6817 percent the liberals 
646 percent the peasants 227 percent the ecological movement 
245 percent 
in the lower chamber of deputies the front got 6730 percent 
the liberals 60 percent the peasants 231 the ecological 
movement 269 percent 
the hungarian democratic union apparently winning broad 
allegiance from romanias 2 million ethnic hungarians emerged as 
the largest opposition party in parliament taking 741 percent in 
the senate and 743 percent in the chamber of deputies 
the other votes for the 506 parliamentary seats went to tiny 
parties 
justice minister teofil pop was mobbed by protesters and 
government secretarygeneral sever georgescu was grabbed by the 
collar when they visited 24 hunger strikers in university square 
tuesday night both had to flee 
the hunger strikers want a ban on former communist officials 
holding public office for 10 years

experiments have shown for the first time that 
human blood cells carrying foreign genes will zero in on tumors 
opening a new strategy for treating cancer researchers said 
tuesday 
the preliminary study conducted on seven patients is the first 
approved attempt at human gene therapy inserting potentially 
helpful genes inside the body in places where nature failed to put 
them 
the experiment was intended to show that the approach was 
possible physicians introduced a bacterial gene that had no effect 
on the patients cancer 
soon however they plan to equip patients blood cells with a 
gene that delivers a powerful natural cancerkilling substance 
known as tumor necrosis factor the researchers hope that will cure 
the disease by blitzing the tumor with extremely high levels of 
toxic proteins 
this is the first study in which foreign genes have been 
introduced into humans with survival of those cells said dr 
steven a rosenberg this is meant to pave the way to introducing 
genes that can improve the survival of cancer patients 
his pilot study showed that not only did the cells survive they 
homed in on tumors and produced a foreign protein there 
rosenberg outlined his results at the annual meeting of the 
american society of clinical oncology a more detailed report is 
scheduled to be published in the new england journal of medicine 
dr robert young of philadelphias fox chase cancer center noted 
that while biologists have isolated genes that make potentially 
useful substances transferring that knowledge from the petri dish 
to cancer patients has been difficult 
the introduction of foreign genes and transferring them into 
human cells and putting them back into humans is an extremely 
important observation young said of rosenbergs work the 
potential of doing this and asking therapeutic questions is now 
possible 
rosenberg a national cancer institute researcher developed a 
cancer treatment known as adoptive immunotherapy intended to 
harness the bodys own cancerfighting chemicals to control the 
disease 
his first results using the protein interleukin2 attracted 
wide attention when they were announced five years ago followup 
research showed only a small minority of patients perhaps 5 
percent to 10 percent respond with complete reversal of the 
disease 
the latest work is an attempt to boost the power of those 
natural chemicals by delivering them directly to the tumor at 
tuesdays meeting rosenberg described the results of experiments 
over the past year on his first five patients 
first doctors removed socalled tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes 
from each patient those are cancerhunting white blood cells that 
had invaded the tumors of patients dying of melanoma a form of 
skin cancer 
then doctors isolated a gene that gives bacteria the ability to 
resist the antibiotic neomycin they put that gene into a crippled 
virus which in turn carried it into the patients white blood 
cells 
finally they multiplied the blood cells in test tubes with 
interleukin2 a growth hormone injecting 200 billion of those 
cells into each patient 
because the cells carried a bacterial gene doctors could track 
them through the patients bodies they found that the manipulated 
cells persisted in the blood for up to 189 days 
they performed biopsies on two patients and found the cells in 
the tumors making the bacterial protein 64 days after the 
injections 
all of the patients treated were expected to die within three 
months two of them responded well to the boosted levels of 
tumorinfiltrating cells and the melanoma has disappeared in one 
completely for 10 months 
rosenberg said the experiment worked just as his team had hoped 
there were no suprises in this he said i am looking 
forward to trials that hopefully will help cancer patients 
he said he and colleagues had already succeeded in inserting the 
gene that makes tumor necrosis factor into human blood cells those 
cells make 100 times higher levels of the protein than are 
ordinarily present 
rosenberg said he hoped to win approval within a few months from 
several regulating committees so he can try the next step on 
melanoma patients

iraq and the palestine liberation 
organization claimed tuesday that western allegations about a 
super gun said to be able to launch nuclear weapons at israel 
were a prelude to an attack against iraqi installations 
but arab diplomatic sources requesting anonymity also said 
tuesday that iraq was behind a conciliatory message to be sent to 
the united states and soviet union at their summit may 30 
foreign minister tariq aziz and the plos political department 
chief farouk kaddoumi linked western charges about an iraqi 
weapon to the influx of soviet jews into israel and the weekend 
killing of seven arab laborers near tel aviv 
an increase in jewish immigrants in israel is seen as a threat 
to arab settlers in israelioccupied territories the two officials 
said these were antiarab developments that could lead to an attack 
on iraq 
theres no doubt that this political and propaganda campaign 
is a prelude for a strike against our technological and 
scientific installations aziz told the arab foreign ministers 
they spoke at the inaugural session of an arab foreign ministers 
meeting at the alrashid hotel the meeting convened to prepare for 
a special summit of arab leaders in baghdad set for may 28 
the summit was called by plo chairman yasser arafat to discuss 
the emigration of hundreds of thousands of soviet jews to israel 
iraq asked that its confrontation with the west be included on the 
agenda 
jerusalem is calling you o leaders of the arab world said 
banners flying in the streets of the iraqi capital others said 
arab unity is the shield against threats to our scientific 
development 
but efforts to achieve the longsought unity suffered a setback 
tuesday when syria and lebanon failed to show up 
damascus had said it would not attend a summit in iraq its main 
arab foe lebanon twothirds of its territory under control of 
40000 syrian troops had said it would participate if all other 
arabs did 
iraqi president saddam hussein brushed aside the feud with 
syria ruled by a rival wing of the arab baath socialist party he 
sent an envoy to damascus on monday to persuade president hafez 
assad to change his mind but assad refused 
arafat had insisted the arab meeting be held before the may 
30june 3 superpower summit between president bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in washington 
arab diplomatic sources insisting on anonymity said the arab 
leaders would send a message drafted by iraq to bush and 
gorbachev 
it urges bush and gorbachev to work for reviving arabisraeli 
peace initiatives and to curtail jewish immigration to israel the 
letter requests that the united states and europe open their 
borders to some immigrants 
the message also reassures washington and moscow that iraqs 
scientific and technological projects were for peaceful purposes 
britain said in march it confiscated a shipment of 40 electronic 
capacitors destined for iraq the devices can be used to trigger 
nuclear weapons 
shortly after britain impounded steel tubes it said was part of 
a giant gun greece turkey and italy later said they seized 
shipments that may have been components of the gun

president bush on tuesday signed into law a 
bill making it illegal to develop and possess biological weapons 
i call upon the leaders of all nations to join us in our drive 
to rid the world of biological and chemical weapons and to do 
everything in their power to stop the proliferation of these 
weapons of mass destruction bush said in a statement 
praising congress for passing the legislation bush saluted the 
leadership for its commitment to our shared goal of destroying 
forever the evil shadow these weapons have cast around the world 
the measure puts into effect a 1972 treaty against biological 
weapons 
biological weapons are harmful forms of bacteria viruses fungi 
or naturally occuring toxins that could be directed at an enemy a 
biological weapon could be unleashed on an unsuspecting public by 
using it in a liquid to contaminate water or in an aerosol that is 
dropped by bomb 
in 1925 the geneva protocol banned the first use in war of 
biological and chemical weapons but did not address the 
development production possession or transfer of the weapons 
fortyfour years later president nixon ordered the defense 
department to destroy its arsenal of biological weapons the united 
states then spearheaded the fight for an international ban on 
production and possession of them 
on april 10 1972 in washington moscow and london 111 
countries signed the biological weapons convention which prohibits 
production and possession of the weapons

east germany on tuesday accused a former top 
communist official of squandering government money the first 
formal criminal charges to be brought against a member of the old 
regime 
also tuesday lawmakers from the ruling coalition called for the 
resignation of interior minister petermichael diestel for trying 
to use an excommunist spymaster as an adviser and for failing to 
fully dismantle the former governments system of police informers 
peter przbylski a spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office said werner krolikowski 61 a member of the former 
communist partys ruling politburo and a deputy prime minister 
faces trial in an east berlin city court on charges of abuse of 
trust 
no trial date has been set he said 
the charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison 
krolikowski has been under house arrest since authorities began 
investigating past abuses of the former regime early this year 
he has been accused of using his powerful position to build 
homes with swimming pools for his son przbylski said the 
properties were worth in excess of 600000 
although he is the first former top official to be charged with 
a crime he may also be the last several members of the aging old 
guard are not expected to see the inside of a courtroom 
former communist party leader erich honecker 88 and several 
other officials ousted in last octobers prodemocracy revolt are 
under investigation for abuse of power corruption and other 
charges but many of the charges have been dropped 
honecker is in a soviet sanitorium in east germany and is 
reported seriously ill 
diestel a member of the coalition government that replaced the 
communists has come under increased fire for what critics say is 
his unwillingness to purge his interior ministry of police linked 
with the old regime 
on tuesday lawmakers from his own political party called for 
his resignation 
he has not smashed the old structure of the ministry for state 
security said juergen schwarz a spokesman for the german social 
union delegation in parliament 
schwarz said a majority of lawmakers believe that the mistrust 
is pronounced and his resignation is urged 
diestel said he was surprised and troubled by the call for 
his resignation 
members of prime minister lothar de maizieres christian 
democratic union have also called for diestels resignation 
west german and east german lawmakers have joined in sharply 
criticizing diestel for trying to bring in former communist 
spymaster markus wolf who is wanted in west germany to help with 
the dissolution of east germanys notorious communist secret police 
critics say diestel still has hundreds of members of the former 
secret police on the payroll and has shown little enthusiasm for 
investigating past crimes of the muchfeared security network

a treaty to sharply reduce us and soviet 
troops in europe is unlikely to be concluded by the end of the year 
unless a halfdozen thorny issues are settled this summer a senior 
bush administration official said tuesday 
soviet concerns about german unification and about the 
reliability of its warsaw pact allies are leading reasons for the 
setback the official said at a white house briefing 
president bush predicted a year ago that the treaty would be 
completed within six to 12 months it would be signed by 35 nations 
at a summit meeting in paris 
since then however most of the soviet allies in the warsaw 
pact have replaced hardline governments with more moderate 
regimes west germany and east germany are on track to unify this 
summer 
secretary of state james a baker iii was unable to overcome the 
slump in troop negotiations during four days of talks last week in 
moscow but he reached agreement with president mikhail s 
gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to cut us 
and soviet nucleartipped cruise missiles and to end production of 
chemical weapons 
bush and gorbachev are expected to act on both agreements at 
their summit meeting in washington may 31june 3 
before the slowdown the united states and the soviet union 
agreed last december on new troop levels in europe 195000 for 
each in central europe and an additional 30000 us troops in 
western europe 
to get down to that ceiling the soviets would have to pull some 
400000 troops back behind their borders about 100000 americans 
would come home 
the treaty also would set limits on battle tanks artillery 
armored combat vehicles combat aircraft and combat helicopters 
requiring cutbacks in all categories 
the purpose of the treaty is to reduce eastwest tensions across 
the vast expanse of europe from the atlantic in the west to the 
ural mountains in the soviet union the negotiations technically 
are being conducted by the north atlantic treaty organization and 
the warsaw pact but the negotiators in vienna take their cues 
from the united states and the soviet union 
the official said there is disagreement over aircraft tanks 
troop limits how weapons would be destroyed and over safeguards 
against cheating 
he said the soviets did not engage in serious negotiations 
with baker on these issues in moscow but the official stressed the 
slowdown had deeper causes what he called the dissolution of 
the warsaw pact and concerns about german unification 
if we dont have substantive agreement by this summer it will 
be hard to have a treaty by the end of the year he said 
that would mean postponing the paris summit of nato warsaw pact 
and neutral nations as well the official said 
having lost some 20 million people some estimates are as high 
as 26 million in world war ii the soviets are apprehensive about 
confronting a powerful german army while their own troops and tanks 
are being scaled back 
also the warsaw pact countries that stood between germany and 
the soviet union are drifting away

two members of congress called on the bush 
administration on tuesday to use its authority to lift immigration 
restrictions on people infected with the aids virus 
the administration says only congress can change the 
restrictions but reps henry waxman dcalif and j roy rowland 
dga said that according to a legal opinion from the general 
accounting office the administration has the power to modify the 
aids exclusion policy 
the policy should be changed now waxman said 
a statement issued by the department of health and human 
services said that officials read with interest the gao legal 
opinion but still hold to the administrations view 
the administration has maintained it lacks the authority to lift 
the restrictions because they were ordered by congress in 1987 
congress directed the president to add infection with the aids 
virus to a list of diseases used to bar entry to the united states 
the administration continues to believe that the issue of 
amending or reversing this recent congressional mandate imposed on 
the president by a vote of 960 in the senate rests with the 
congress the statement said 
officials at the federal centers for disease control in atlanta 
in march recommended that infection with the aids virus be removed 
from the list 
rowland and waxman introduced a bill last month that would give 
federal health officials authority over the list of contagious 
diseases 
but in view of the gao opinion waxman said the question is 
now plainly before the president 
the departments statement said the extent of the 
administrations power was that the attorney general could grant 
waivers to aliens infected with the aids virus for temporary visits 
in that regard the administration announced last month a new 
10day visa for foreigners attending certain white houseapproved 
conferences in the united states travelers with the visa do not 
have to reveal whether they are infected with the aids virus 
the action was taken in response to criticism from international 
organizations that have said they will boycott an international 
conference on aids in san francisco next month

state health officials have no explanation 
for a mystery illness which has stricken at least seven children 
and possibly many others prompting hundreds of calls from worried 
parents 
we are in for the long haul dr dennis perrotta the texas 
department of healths director of epidemiology in austin said 
tuesday this is going to be a tough one 
the disease causes high fevers debilitating joint pain sore 
throats and rashes it has been confirmed in seven children between 
the ages of 3 and 12 some of the children have been hospitalized 
for up to a month 
so far none of the cases has been fatal and victims seem to 
make a full recovery said dr jeffrey w jundt who has treated 
the seven confirmed cases 
state health officials said tuesday they have gotten 200 to 300 
calls from concerned parents and others since word first surfaced 
in newspapers during the weekend investigators from the centers 
for disease control in atlanta have been called 
jundt an arthritis specialist at scott amp white memorial 
hospital and clinic in temple said the seven confirmed cases 
appeared in rural east and central texas 
the ailment has been dubbed palestine fever after the east 
texas town in which the three earliest cases surfaced starting in 
march palestine is about 100 miles southeast of dallas 
we traveled to temple and palestine and talked to the 
physicians and visited with the some of the families perrotta 
said we have corroborated what dr jundt has told us we have 
not been able to come up with the answer it does look like there 
are more cases 
he said the department would probably complete an exposure 
questionnaire by wednesday and begin collecting more followup 
information by the weeks end 
the treatment involves aspirin and antibiotics jundt said 
he sees a similarity between this ailment and lyme disease a 
tickborne illness lyme disease had been going on for a long 
time jundt said but it wasnt recognized until a cluster of 
cases at lyme conn raised a question he said 
theres a possibility this disease has been around for a 
while he said 
one patient 11yearold michael sharp of copperas cove lost 21 
pounds in the seven weeks he suffered from the ailment

a laotian man who used opium to treat an 
18yearold war wound faces deportation proceedings under a federal 
law his attorney says wasnt intended for cases like his 
chao yang 38 says he began smoking opium as a painkiller in 
1972 after his knee was shattered by a bullet during a battle with 
north vietnamese soldiers in laos 
still using crutches yang is in custody at sherburne county 
jail waiting to see if the government wants to deport him because 
he shipped opium through the mail 
he was admitted to the country seeking political asylum and the 
decision on his application has yet to be made 
attorney sam myers said yang faces deportation proceedings 
because of a 1988 law that congress enacted to crack down on 
foreign drug kingpins 
i think everyone was surprised because i dont think anybody 
realized this would be the effect of the law myers said 
myers said the government agrees yang is not a drug dealer 
in laos ethnic hmong people have cultivated opium for 
generations and many used it the way westerners use 
overthecounter painkillers 
when he emigrated to the united states in 1985 yang who is 
hmong tried legal medications 
he went to st paulramsey medical center and all they gave 
him was tylenol geez that didnt do any good myers said yang 
went back to opium 
after his arrest in april 1989 yang was convicted on drug 
charges and served six months in a federal medical prison in 
rochester when he finished his sentence last month he planned to 
return to his wife and two teenage daughters in st paul 
but under the omnibus crime and control act of 1988 yang was 
held without a court hearing by the immigration and naturalization 
service the law was designed to prevent foreign citizens convicted 
of drug offenses from fleeing automatic deportation efforts 
myers said yang is not a flight risk 
complicating the case is a washington order barring the 
immigration service from sending immigrants back to vietnam 
cambodia or laos because many fled political persecution and face 
prison or death if they return 
myers said he will challenge the constitutionality of the acts 
provision that allow detention without a bail hearing yangs 
deportation hearing was scheduled for july 25 in minneapolis 
if one is looking for a bad guy here its congress myers 
said because congress passed a law that allowed for no 
exceptions and any time you pass a law with no exceptions youre 
just begging for injustice

amnesty international said wednesday that 
pakistans human rights record has improved under prime minister 
benazir bhutto but abuses reportedly persist including torture 
rape and whippings 
the report by the worldwide human rights group said 2029 death 
sentences were commuted after mrs bhutto took office in october 
1988 thousands of prisoners were freed and compensation was 
promised for torture victims 
but amnesty said scores of people were reportedly tortured in 
police stations last year including at least eight women who were 
allegedly raped torture in prisons has decreased but is still 
likely to recur as those responsible have not been brought to 
trial 
the allegations appear in the summary of a memorandum submitted 
to the bhutto government following an amnesty visit to pakistan 
last summer 
it said whipping remains as a punishment for certain crimes 
fetters are used in prisons imprisonment on religious grounds 
continues 
also special courts which do not conform to international 
standards for fair trials can impose the death penalty and try 
certain political offenses the government has taken some steps 
to monitor police abuses by setting up a body to monitor police 
atrocities the report says 
but it calls for further safeguards including strict limits on 
incommunicado detention prompt access to lawyers doctors and 
relatives prompt referrals to magistrates independent 
investigations of torture allegations and special measures to 
protect detained women and children 
it said whipping amputation and stoning to death introduced by 
the previous government of the late president mohammed zia ulhaq 
remain on the law books and that two public floggings took place 
last year 
fetters are still used on prisoners including children 
while thousands of prisoners jailed under zias martial law were 
released several hundred martial law convicts remain imprisoned 
including possible political prisoners 
the report says special antiterrorism courts are increasingly 
used in sind province where internal violence has left thousands 
dead in the past years the courts fail to meet international 
standards for fair trial because they presume the defendant guilty 
in certain circumstances it said

romanias newly formed government tolerated 
violence and voter intimidation before last sundays national 
elections the coleader of an international observer team said 
tuesday 
sen joseph lieberman dconn just back from bucharest after 
monitoring romanias first free elections in 53 years said the 
united states should supply humanitarian aid immediately but he 
said further aid should be conditioned on the new governments 
ability to move toward democracy 
there was a lot of unfairness in the preelection process 
lieberman told reporters some of it was intentional by the 
government party and some of it was unintentional 
a problem facing the opposition parties he said was a lack of 
time to organize a campaign against the governing party which 
dominated media outlets 
what happened on sunday was a significant step forward toward 
democracy but there is a lot more to be done lieberman said 
theyve come a long way they deserve some help but they also 
need some pressure to continue to move toward more human rights 
more political freedom and greater recognition of the rights of 
minorities particularly hungarians 
according to results reported tuesday interim president ion 
iliescu defeated the opposition in romanias election with 859 
percent of the vote 
the victory was expected but the margin was large enough to 
worry some observers and even some in iliescus own party about the 
goal of establishing a true democracy with a strong opposition 
party 
iliescus two opponents said they will seek to nullify the 
election on grounds of fraud and indicated it was unlikely they 
would join a national unity government and at least 4000 
protesters filled bucharests university square shouting that the 
election was a fraud 
lieberman who said the romanian capital was still riddled with 
bullet holes from the fighting that led to the overthrow of 
dictator nicolae ceausescu said violence and intimidation were 
reported by members of the opposition parties but he said the 
reports of telephone harassment and even some beatings could not be 
linked conclusively to the iliescu government 
while i could not conclude that the government party and the 
president himself had anything directly to do with that violence 
and intimidation the president did not go out of his way to 
condemn it lieberman said and i think that contributed to an 
unfortunate atmosphere there 
lieberman said the united states should provide training and 
emergency aid particularly for babies in romanian orphanages many 
of whom have suffered from a lack of medical care 
but we ought not to write a blank and permanent check to the 
government he said longterm funding should be made 
contingent upon continued movement toward democracy 
lieberman was one of three coleaders of a 60member 
international delegation sponsored by the national democratic 
institute for international affairs the group is chaired by former 
vice president walter mondale and includes many prominent democrats 
among its senior advisers

stormie jones the worlds longest surviving 
heartliver transplant patient was released from a hospital 
tuesday and doctors said a mild episode of liver rejection appeared 
to be under control 
were out of the hospital and are staying with friends said 
stormies mother lois suzie purcell 
shes doing better they know she doesnt like to be in 
the hospital so they are trying to make it as comfortable for her 
as possible 
stormie could return to her white settlement texas home within 
a few days possibly by may 31 her 13th birthday mrs purcell 
said 
stormie returned to childrens hospital of pittsburgh on sunday 
after routine tests showed high liver enzyme levels a sign of 
possible organ rejection 
further tests revealed the rejection was moderate and could be 
controlled with increased doses of an experimental antirejection 
medication stormie has taken since november said hospital 
spokeswoman sue cardillo 
doctors do not think stormie will need a third liver transplant 
stormie takes fk506 which the food and drug administration 
approved for use only at childrens and nearby 
presbyterianuniversity hospital 
she received the drug intravenously in the hospital and will 
resume taking it orally 
dr robert d gordon transplant surgeon at childrens said 
monday when youre using a new drug youre a little sensitive to 
toxicity oversensitive perhaps we now realize we lowered our 
dosages a little too much 
modifications in dosages also will be made for many of the 400 
transplant patients currently taking fk506 i think weve been 
making that error systematically over the last few months gordon 
said 
in 1984 stormie received the double transplant to control a 
congenital condition that left her cholesterol levels 10 times 
higher than normal 
she returned to pittsburgh for a second liver transplant 
performed early this year after hepatitis damaged her first donor 
liver

white house and congressional negotiators 
moved toward a consensus on tuesday that they must find about 500 
billion in new taxes and spending cuts over the next five years to 
balance the budget participants said 
at the third round of highlevel deficitreduction talks in the 
capitol the bush administration also unveiled a new higher 
estimate of the costs of rescuing the savings and loan industry 
the administration now says the bailout could cost as much as 61 
billion next year participants said about 11 billion higher than 
previous estimates 
democrats and republicans remained divided over precisely how 
much savings would be needed to balance the budget within five 
years democrats said 500 billion or more was necessary citing 
estimates by the nonpartisan congressional budget office 
republicans said the total necessary could be between 400 
billion to 500 billion they relied on projections by the white 
houses office of management and budget which until now has been 
saying that an improving economy will allow the budget to be 
balanced by 1995 omb presented figures tuesday showing that unless 
action is taken the budget would still be 32 billion in the red 
in 1995 
nonetheless both sides emerged from their meeting having 
narrowed their differences somewhat over the size of the deficit 
problem the government faces they also spoke optimistically about 
their prospects for finding a solution 
the future looks very good to me in terms of us being able to 
get it done said sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking 
republican on the senate budget committee 
theres no consensus yet but i dont think wed characterize 
the meetings as containing any sharp disagreements said senate 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
negotiators did not discuss proposals for how budget savings 
would be achieved a stage that participants say is weeks away 
tuesdays threehour session was dominated by technical discussions 
by white house and congressional budget experts about how large the 
federal deficit appears to be 
were continuing to define the problem sasser said 
participants said the administrations new estimated costs of 
the savings and loan bailout remained uncertain house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif called the 61 billion 
figure a real hitandmiss number 
before tuesdays meeting sasser said he believed social 
security benefits should be offlimits as negotiators search for 
ways to shrink next years federal deficit 
sasser in stating his opposition to paring social security 
payments raised an issue nearly as politically sensitive as the 
question of new taxes 
members of both parties are reluctant to antagonize the nations 
39 million retirees who receive social security benefits 
republicans lawmakers in particular have been cautious on the issue 
ever since they backed an effort to limit benefits in 1985 from 
which thenpresident reagan eventually backed away 
sasser conceded that negotiators would talk about everything 
but said it would be unfair to turn to social security for deficit 
reduction 
the payroll tax paid by workers and their employers has been 
boosted this year he said noting that the social security system 
is running an annual surplus of tens of billions of dollars 
i dont see the equity in that sasser said of benefit 
cutbacks 
social security is expected to cost the government about 265 
billion next year about onefifth of the total budget advocates 
of trimming benefits as part of a deficitreduction package argue 
that it comprises too large a portion of the budget to ignore 
the retirement system is expected to run a 74 billion surplus 
next year as it builds up a cushion to pay for retiring baby 
boomers in the next century the payroll tax rate edged up by 014 
percent in january to 765 percent 
its likely to be several meetings before budget negotiators 
begin swapping proposals about cutting the deficit for the next 
fiscal year which begins oct 1 the opening discussions have 
focused on technical issues 
the goal of the talks is to find ways to reduce the 1991 
shortfall to 64 billion the target set by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
if the budget gap exceeds that amount by 10 billion the law 
triggers whatever spending cuts are necessary to lower the gap to 
64 billion 
the white house has been increasing its projection of the 1991 
deficit since january when it said a 100 billion shortfall was 
likely 
last week the administration estimated the shortfall at between 
123 billion and 138 billion that excluded the costs of shoring 
up the savings and loan industry which could have a 50 billion 
pricetag 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates a 1991 
budget gap between 149 billion and 159 billion with the thrift 
bailout the gap could grow to as much as 246 billion cbo said

hundreds of demonstrators chased a 
highranking government representative into a downtown hotel 
tuesday evening forcing him to abandon his attempt to hold a 
dialogue with hunger strikers 
anticommunist protesters have occupied university square and 
blocked the capitals central intersection since april 22 
on tuesday the government made its most determined effort to 
date to establish a dialogue with the demonstrators 
justice minister teofil pop and sever georgescu the 
governments secretary general were sent to speak to 24 hunger 
strikers some of whom have been without food for more than three 
weeks 
six of the hunger strikers passed out but were revived monday 
the demonstrators who numbered at least 4000 tuesday and 
hunger strikers have been demanding the exclusion from politics of 
former communists such as interim president ion iliescu the 
protesters now also are charging that sundays election was 
fraudulent they are demanding a televised dialogue with iliescu 
and prime minister petre roman 
iliescu and his national salvation front won resounding 
victories in sundays elections they have dominated political life 
here since dictator nicolae ceausescu was deposed and executed in 
the december revolution 
the hunger strikers had not been informed of the delegations 
impending arrival but news media were notified and dozens of 
journalists converged on the crowded tent encampment in the square 
we have had enough of the bbc and the americans who 
acknowledged the government said dumitru dinca a spokesman for 
the antitotalitarian front protest group we shall do justice by 
ourselves without either the russians or the americans 
when georgescu arrived he was surrounded menacingly by a 
fastgrowing crowd of people who took him for interior minister 
mihai chitac whose resignation has been demanded by the protesters 
the crowd grew increasingly vocal and violent then one 
protester grabbed georgescu by the collar forcing him to flee into 
the intercontinental hotel 
he left the hotel through a back door as hundreds of whistling 
booing protesters berated him and shouted you thieves stole the 
revolution 
pop continued talking with the hunger strikers without being 
disturbed but as he tried to leave he too was surrounded by 
angry demonstrators and had to be protected by hunger strikers as 
he plowed his way to his official car 
the government later released a statement saying its 
representatives were unable to hold a dialogue with the hunger 
strikers because of the aggressive intervention of some people 
who through their violence gave their political demands a 
profoundly undemocratic character 
these people are violating the laws of the country both in 
their political actions and in their physical aggression against 
the representatives of the government in violation of the 
elementary laws governing public peace and order 
iliescu called for the square to be cleaned out last week 
but the goverment chose to tolerate the demonstration through the 
election

british defense secretary tom king on 
tuesday raised the possibility that negotiators would fail to wrap 
up an accord this year to slash troops tanks and other nonnuclear 
weapons in europe 
we havent got an agreement yet and we arent sure when 
were going to get one king told reporters at a meeting of the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
western officials have complained in recent weeks that the 
soviet union has slowed progress in reaching a conventional arms 
treaty although they have said they were optimistic a deal could 
be struck in the fall 
the west has insisted an agreement must be reached before the 
holding of a summit of leaders of the 35 nations that form the 
conference on security and cooperation in europe the soviets have 
urged the conference be held this year 
the key twoday nato meeting was to review what us defense 
secretary dick cheney called new ways of doing business in an 
era of reduced eastwest tensions 
on monday west european defense ministers meeting separately 
at the alliance headquarters in brussels urged nato to adapt to 
the changing security environment 
as an example of new strategy in response to the impending 
unification of germany cheney said a nato corps could be formed 
with divisions from different nations 
such a force would also emphasize the fact that germany is 
not treated any differently than anyone else he told reporters 
aboard his flight to brussels 
king who met with highlevel soviet officials in moscow last 
week said there was certainly a risk that a conventional arms 
agreement would not be reached this year 
were not happy about it he said we want to see an early 
resolution theres no change in our position 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg told reporters 
in a separate news conference that the arms talks have become more 
complicated 
negotiators for the 16 nato nations and the seven members of the 
sovietled warsaw pact have been bargaining in vienna to try to 
bring both sides to equal ceilings in main battle tanks armored 
combat vehicles artillery troops combat aircraft and combat 
helicopters 
the two sides are still trying to agree on a ceiling for combat 
aircraft and on measures to verify compliance with the accord 
king said the kremlin was concerned about the talks in light of 
the political upheavals in its onetime staunch warsaw pact allies 
theres no doubt there are worries he said 
he said it was unclear whether the soviets were dragging their 
feet as a bargaining ploy or not but he said they appeared to be 
placing more emphasis on the international talks on german unity 
he said the soviets appeared to feel there would not be any 
great embarrassment if there were a delay of a few months 
a key clause of the proposed deal called the sufficiency rule 
would limit the holdings of any one country to a certain 
percentage of the overall number of tanks artillery and other 
equipment 
the soviets however argue that countries like czechoslovakia 
hungary and east germany are not as tightly bound to the kremlin as 
they once were and east germany may soon be joining west germany to 
form a united country

prosecutors sought tuesday to modify charges 
against an art gallery being prosecuted for obscenity for 
exhibiting photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe 
at a hearing originally called on a request by the contemporary 
arts center to dismiss the charges hamilton county authorities 
asked to reword an indictment to conform to wording in a us 
supreme court ruling on obscenity 
the wording is one of the grounds on which the art center is 
seeking to have the charges dismissed hamilton county municipal 
judge david albanese set a hearing for thursday to review the 
prosecution request 
the judge said he planned to visit the 175photograph exhibit 
which closes saturday before ruling on the request to dismiss the 
charges 
such conservative lawmakers as sen jesse helms rnc and 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif have attacked the national 
endowment for the arts for supporting mapplethorpes exhibition 
gallery director dennis barrie and the gallery are charged with 
pandering obscenity and using children in material involving 
nudity if convicted they would face 6000 in fines barrie also 
would face six months in jail 
the charges concern seven photos five of homoerotic acts and 
two with nude or nearly nude children 
senior assistant city prosecutor frank h prouty jr said the 
city wants the indictment to specify that photographs of two nude 
children in the exhibit include a lewd graphic exhibition of the 
genitals 
the indictment issued april 7 says the exhibition includes a 
photograph of a minor male child with his genitals exposed and 
a photograph of a minor female child with her genitals 
exposed 
prouty also asked to add a phrase to the indictment to allege 
that five pictures of sex acts in the exhibit are obscene as 
defined by the supreme courts ruling in miller vs california 
in the 1973 decision the supreme court said that in order to be 
obscene material must violate community standards depict clearly 
offensive sexual conduct and lack artistic value 
h louis sirkin a lawyer for the art gallery said he will 
oppose the citys request contending the judge should not have the 
power to alter a grand jurys indictment it has to come from the 
grand jury he said

ivan f boesky calmly admitted tuesday that he 
paid for inside information with briefcases full of cash as wall 
streets most celebrated felon gave his first public testimony 
since his 1986 plea bargain 
testifying against former friend john a mulheren jr on 
securities fraud charges boesky recounted the crimes he committed 
with other players in wall streets insider trading scandal such 
as dennis levine formerly with drexel burnham lambert inc and 
investment banker martin siegel 
did you understand you were committing a crime when you traded 
on inside information from dennis levine asked assistant us 
attorney scott gilbert 
yes boesky said in a firm and loud voice 
boesky center of the biggest insider trading crime scandal in 
wall street history made his entrance through a back door of 
manhattan federal court where he faced mulheren and a packed 
courtroom it was boeskys first public appearance since he was 
released early from a threeyear prison term last month 
cleanshaven white hair cropped short boesky wore a charcoal 
gray suit white shirt and dark tie mulheren a wellknown and 
eccentric speculator who wears casual clothes sat at the defense 
table several yards away 
boesky testified that he received inside information about 
proposed takeover attempts from levine and siegel and that he had 
agreed to pay them up to five percent of his firms profits for 
their help 
he said he never gave levine any money siegel however 
recieved a total of 800000 in three cash deliveries boesky said 
it was assembled by a colleague out of my personal accounts 
put into a briefcase and handed by an intermediary to mr siegel 
boesky said 
a fourth cash delivery to siegel was canceled when he recieved 
word about a securities and exchange commission investigation into 
levines dealings he said 
levine the first to implicate boesky pleaded guilty to felony 
charges in june 1986 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
seigel also pleaded guilty to securities fraudrelated counts and 
is awaiting sentencing 
boesky is the governments main witness against mulheren on 
charges of stock manipulation and other securities fraud 
violations his testimony was expected to be the high point of the 
trial 
the two once were close friends but mulheren became enraged when 
he learned boesky had implicated him in wrongdoing a few years ago 
at one point mulheren allegedly plotted to assassinate him with an 
assault rifle weapons charges against mulheren were subsequently 
dropped 
boesky who avoided eye contact with mulheren described 
mulheren as a business associate and friend who once helped save 
his trading company from collapse 
he said mulheren was one of his few friends with whom he shared 
the information he received from levine and seigel although he 
never revealed its source 
mulheren 40 is accused of manipulating one stock price and 
concealing ownership of other stocks to help boesky cheat on his 
taxes and evade federal securities laws 
for example boesky said that in july 1985 mulherens firm 
jamie securities bought 330000 shares of unocal corp stock that 
he held with the understanding boesky would compensate him for any 
losses in the stocks value boeskys testimony is expected to take 
days he returns to the witness stand on wednesday 
when asked during the lunch break for his reaction to boeskys 
testimony mulheren said not much excitement 
boesky paid 100 million in penalties and pleaded guilty to one 
felony to settle the biggest insider trading case ever in exchange 
he gave government investigators incriminating information about a 
number of others 
the biggest victims of boeskys information were the nowdefunct 
investment banking company drexel burnham lambert inc and its 
junkbond trading specialist michael milken both have pleaded 
guilty to numerous fraud charges that include fines with a combined 
total exceeding 1 billion 
mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy securities 
fraud mail fraud and violating federal recordkeeping laws he 
faces a maximum five years in prison and 250000 fine on each 
count

the house agriculture committee voted tuesday 
to establish a national dairy program that guarantees farmers 
1010 per hundred pounds of milk as long as surpluses stay below 5 
billion pounds 
the section of the 1990 farm bill differs from a plan approved 
earlier by the panels subcommittee on livestock dairy and poultry 
that proposal included producer assessments and set up a 
twotiered price support system that would have given farmers one 
price for the bulk of their milk and a lesser price for the amount 
considered excess by the government 
rep charles stenholm dtexas chairman of the subcommittee 
said the bill brought before the full committee was changed because 
so many people in congress and the industry disagreed with the 
original plan 
this is an effort to allow everyone to have an opportunity to 
have their opinion heard said stenholm who presented the new 
plan with rep steve gunderson of wisconsin the ranking republican 
on the subcommittee 
this is a dairy support program to provide stability to 
producers said gunderson 
the two lawmakers successfully fought off amendments offered in 
committee that would have further redesigned the dairy program 
the government traditionally has supported dairy farmers by 
setting a price it will pay for storable dairy products such as 
cheese butter and nonfat dry milk that arent bought by 
processors in the open market 
however overproduction has been an expensive problem for the 
government that lawmakers have been trying to correct 
the plan adopted by the committee tuesday would maintain for the 
next five years the current price of 1010 per hundredweight of 
milk if surpluses bought up by the government are between 35 
billion and 5 billion pounds if surpluses fall below 35 billion 
the government would pay 1055 per hundredweight 
however if dairy farmers produce between 501 billion and 7 
billion pounds more than the market will bear the government will 
pay only 985 to 960 per hundredweight 
if more than 7 billion pounds of surpluses result in any one 
year of the fiveyear farm bill the agriculture department would 
be authorized to establish an inventory management program 
stenholm emphasized that the price support system does not 
include assessments or a rigid quota system these portions of the 
earlier version of the bill were considered its main problem

warning that she would be killed unless she stopped talking 
judge remigio gonzalez moreno interviewed mrs menem at her 
private residence and told reporters she informed him regarding two 
threats allegedly made by an anonymous male caller who warned her 
not to make any more statements 
gonzalez moreno was named to investigate after mrs menem 
reported receiving the threats last month at the official 
presidential residence in the buenos aires suburb of olivos 
mrs menem often has made public statements highly critical of 
political and economic policies by her husband president carlos 
menem who was inaugurated july 8 she also has charged her husband 
is surrounded by corrupt and untrustworthy aides and advisors 
menem 59 a former provincial governor and member of the 
laborbased peronist party has surprised many argentines by 
advocating replacement of the countrys inefficient 
statecontrolled economy with a freemarket economy in the hopes of 
ending four decades of inflation and economic stagnation 
mrs menem 46 maintaining friendships with several of her 
husbands political foes has adhered to a more traditional 
peronist view questioning in public her husbands policies and the 
effect they will have on workers retirees and the poor in this 
nation of 32 million residents 
she charged in january that the telephones at the presidential 
residence had been tapped and her outgoing calls blocked in what 
she described as an effort to isolate her that charge also is 
under investigation by a federal judge

the residence and would seek a legal separation or divorce from his 
wife the couple married 24 years but reported for years to have 
been estranged has two children daughter zulema eva 19 and son

us defense secretary dick cheney and 
other nato defense chiefs on tuesday backed using their soldiers to 
form multinational armies in europe to keep nato solidarity alive 
the proposal if enacted would result in an overhaul of the 
40yearold pacts military structure 
supporters say it is aimed at producing renewed political 
support for the alliance among member nations as they face the 
evaporation of the warsaw pact and as they prepare to welcome a 
unified germany into their ranks 
given the changing threat there is no alternative said 
cmdr stefan lang a spokesman for the west german defense 
ministry existing forces will be hollowed out and we have to 
reconfigure them 
gen vigleik eide who serves as chairman of the alliances 
military committee formally declared natos primary military foe 
conquered at the morning session telling reporters it is our 
clear assessment that the threat from a united warsaw pact no 
longer exists 
but the norwegian general cautioned the soviet union despite 
its economic and political turmoil still wields forces that are 
very impressive and continues to modernize its forces 
given chances for reduced troop levels in europe with the 
completion of a proposed eastwest accord on conventional forces 
and prospects for sharp cuts in us troops based in europe the 
idea of using multinational military units in nato nations has 
garnered support among the defense ministers lang and other nato 
officials said 
the proposal was discussed as the ministers began a twoday 
session to review the pacts military strategy at this time of 
reduced eastwest tension 
during their conferences the ministers also agreed to take a 
thorough look at their military strategy that has guided the 
alliance through the cold war years 
we reached agreement on that said britains defense chief 
tom king were keen to see it go ahead 
italian defense minister mino martinazzoli said the study must 
be daring 
the officials said the study should take a look at the whole 
range of military practices that nato has followed for many years 
including exercises conventional and nuclear weapons and the 
deployment of forces along the front line which has been put in 
question by prospects of a unified germany 
the ministers also agreed in their closeddoor talks to scrap 
the defense spending guideline that calls for an annual 3 percent 
increase 
nato officials said they would also like to bring france which 
is outside the joint military structure into the alliances 
defense planning 
cheney speaking with reporters en route to brussels backed the 
idea of building multinational forces 
at present nato land forces defend territory under a socalled 
layer cake formula by which an army from an allied nation 
defends a certain geographic sector 
with the elimination of the border between east and west 
germany such a system would have to be revamped 
if all present positive trends continue then we can 
contemplate new ways of doing business cheney said 
i think based on a first look the notion of a multinational 
force has some appeal cheney said i think its worth 
pursuing 
using multinational forces in nato could offer cost savings and 
ease nationalist sensitivities particularly in west germany where 
most nato troops are stationed said a senior defense official 
traveling with cheney 
such forces could also help blunt any drive to take a unified 
germany out of nato 
one way to emphasize the multilateral nature of the nato 
alliance is to have units that are composed of troops of various 
nations cheney said such a plan would also emphasize the fact 
that germany is not treated any differently than anyone else 
as an example cheney said a multinational corps could be formed 
with three divisions each from a different nation a us division 
is made up of about 15000 to 18000 soldiers 
soldiers of multinational units could be based in britain or 
canada for training exercises the official said 
such an arrangement could help reduce complaints among west 
german citizens west germans have grown increasingly irritated 
with nato military exercises and accidents caused by lowflying 
aircraft 
but the official cautioned that setting up multinational forces 
poses many problems including language barriers and varied weapons 
systems

mikhail s gorbachevs presidential council of 
advisers approved a plan tuesday that would double food prices next 
year and introduce other radical reforms to ease the soviet union 
into a market economy by 1995 
the council stressed the need to help the poor survive the high 
prices by introducing compensation and indexing the official news 
agency tass reported 
the government plan will be presented to the supreme soviet 
legislature on thursday by premier nikolai i ryzhkov foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told reporters 
an accompanying resolution decrees that prices on bread so 
cheap some of it is used to feed cattle will be raised as early as 
july to offset higher grain prices but it also calls for immediate 
compensation to help poor people buy bread their main staple 
the resolution also says new laws are needed on free enterprise 
antitrust foreign investment income indexing employment 
banking and customs it requires the laws be ready for passage in 
september 
the program is designed to rescue an economy plagued by huge 
shortages strikes and ethnic conflicts 
while outlining major price increases and other reforms the 
report emphasized the need to control inflation unemployment and 
other social ills 
the government will continue to regulate the cost of basic 
foodstuffs including meat bread and cooking oil a draft of the 
planned reforms said the reforms would stagger the cumulative 
shock over five years instead of the two discussed earlier 
soviet officials are wary lest abrupt increases in food prices 
set off riots and strikes like those that toppled polish communist 
governments in the 1970s and 1980s 
the plan is far more radical than the government program 
presented in december to the soviet congress the supreme soviets 
parent parliament but it falls short of the freemarket measures 
in poland that led to a spurt of rapid inflation the past six 
months 
the earlier plan basically called for three more years of a 
centrally planned economy but sentiment is growing that faster 
steps are needed to improve production and distribution 
a report by ryzhkov on the revised plan said the negative 
effect of political instability strikes and interethnic conflicts 
is growing ever stronger it asked workers to refrain from 
striking 
a parliamentary opposition group attacked the proposed program 
and plans to present an alternative economic blueprint advocating a 
market economy 
the independent news service postfactum quoted siberian 
economist gennady filshin as saying this is just another ploy to 
intimidate the people with the idea of a free market and 
consolidate its own positions 
the kremlins new readiness to take harsh measures become more 
understandable in the light of disturbing figures on current 
economic performance in the first quarter of 1990 cash incomes 
grew by 134 percent while the gross national product declined the 
report says 
up to april political strikes and interethnic conflicts led to 
the loss of 95 million manhours compared to 7 million manhours 
lost in all of 1989 
prices in state stores for many basic foods presently are low 
potatoes cost as little as 8 cents a pound and beef 180 a pound 
but the soviet economy is plagued by shortages with commodities 
rationed in some regions and beef at about 16 a pound at free 
prices in farmers markets and new potatoes at up to 8 a pound 
about 290 million people live in the soviet union

us and european television programs will be 
broadcast to the soviet union by the end of the decade to satisfy 
viewers who are tired of watching politics a soviet official said 
on tuesday 
the western programs will be transmitted via satellite and the 
number of national televsion stations will be raised from two to 
five said mikhail nenachev president of the state committee for 
broadcasting 
there is no political problem with western programs he told 
reporters at the media summit a conference of broadcast 
specialists and policy makers from europe and the united states 
as far as european and us programs are concerned we are 
working very hard to receive them in the soviet union he said 
but because of technical difficulties i do not think we will 
have it on a large scale in the near future 
he said soviets are bored of watching the often televised 
political debates and are hungry for european and american movies 
television shows music and youth programs 
in these days of glasnost and perestroika our television 
uses most of its time for political items its too much he 
said he was using the two russian words for president mikhail s 
gorbachevs system of political reforms 
we forgot about culture news and music we want to make it 
more balanced nenachev said 
he said soviet television also wants to show a european music 
channel and will add three more national stations channels for 
alternative companies such as trade unions or youth groups are 
also under study nenachev said 
but private stations are still out of the question 
we are not ready for that he said 
to accommodate the increase in channels and broadcast time the 
soviet union plans to launch 10 commercial satellites over the next 
three years

gonzo journalist hunter thompson was 
ordered tuesday to stand trial on drug and explosives charges after 
a hearing featuring some lowkey antics by the celebrity defendant 
mesa county district court judge charles buss ruled there was 
sufficient evidence to try the author of such books as fear and 
loathing in las vegas on five felony charges of possessing drugs 
and possessing and storing explosives illegally 
the judge threw out charges of cocaine use in the case which 
stemmed from complaints by a woman who also alleged thompson 
assaulted her in his home in february misdemeanor assault charges 
werent considered tuesday 
thompson 53 figeted throughout the hearing and at times 
muttered under his breath thats bull or ah come on 
particularly during testimony by his accuser 
she is gail palmerslater 35 of port huron mich a business 
entrepreneur and former porn film producer who had written thompson 
several weeks earlier saying she wanted to meet him 
the case began when she complained to pitkin county authorities 
that she had been sexually assaulted while visiting thompson she 
said thompson threw a drink at her twisted her breast and shoved 
her during the visit 
her complaint led to a twoday search in which authorities found 
lsd cocaine diazapam and marijuana and four sticks of dynamite 
at thompsons house 
thompson father of socalled gonzo journalism has written 
books on subjects as diverse as political campaigns and the hells 
angels dwelling as much on the drugdrenched antics of the writer 
as on the subject at hand 
at the noon break thompson the inspiration for the duke 
character in the doonesbury comic strip left the courthouse 
followed by photographers and reporters and at one point stopped to 
pose 
let me do a nixon he said stopping to raise his arms and 
flash a vforvictory signal with both hands 
later asked to comment on the ruling he growled todays pig 
is tomorrows bacon 
protesters outside 99yearold courthouse waved signs saying 
when the going gets weird the weird go to jail another read 
today the doctor tomorrow you in an apparent reference to a 
search of his home that thompson has called excessively thorough 
thompson denies assaulting palmerslater maintaining she was 
drunk and pressuring him to have sex with her when he pushed her 
away 
hal haddon thompsons attorney argued the drugs couldnt be 
proven to belong to thompson because he has so many visitors he 
said the explosives didnt belong to thompson but to someone who 
used them to blow up beaver dams stumps and other obstacles to 
irrigation water

isnt likely to occur soon 
the uscanada freetrade initiative proposed in 1985 and 
begun in january wasnt signed into law until last year 
the recommendations will be the framework in which my 
administration will carry on mexicos trade negotiations salinas 
told 55 senators at the presidential residence

group interested in promoting latin american trade we in the 
us must do all we can to ensure the future of free markets in the 
americas because our nation has a stake in the economic health of 
this hemisphere 
mexican commerce department adviser jaime zabludovsky denied 
reports that a partial freetrade agreement would be signed when 
salinas and bush meet june 1012 
salinas said he would study senate recommendations with an eye 
toward integrating mexico which has about 85 million residents in 
the changing economic world 
mexico will not be left out of the new world configuration 
the speed of the changes requires decisive answers on all fronts 
in all markets he said 
the senate recommendations also advise salinas to take advantage 
of mexicos strategic location next to the united states to expand 
trade with pacific rim countries and europe 
we have given the president a broad mandate in all foreign 
trade relations said senate foreign relations committee 
chairwoman blanca esponda 
the 64member senate is the only authority that must approve 
presidential agreements with foreign countries 
its recommendations were based on trade strategies proposed by 
academics entrepreneurs and politicians sponsored by the senate 
at salinas request 
the majority of the participants said that one of the main 
advantages of free trade agreement between mexico and the united 
states would be a greater flow of foreign investment to mexico due 
to the unbridled access to the us market that mexico would 
have senate president maximiliano silerio esparza said in 
reading its recommendations to salinas 
the recommendations were based on hopes of permanent access to 
the us market and lowering us trade barriers on agricultural 
textile and cement products silerio esparza said 
he said the recommendations include a transition period to let 
mexican industry change to survive an onslaught of american goods 
onto the mexican domestic market 
until recently high mexican tariffs kept out many american goods 
or made them more expensive than similar mexican products because 
of a lack of foreign competitition the prices of mexican products 
were in some cases artificially high 
mexican industry began feeling the pressure from lowerpriced 
imports after mexico joined the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade in 1988 
silerio esparza noted some participants in the trade strategy 
forums opposed closer commercial ties with the united states on the 
grounds they would promote dependence a topic of particular 
concern in mexico 
salinas agreed to senate recommendations that mexico stop short 
of seeking an economic union with the united states of the type 
planned by europe for 1992 
he said such union is not compatible with the national 
objectives of sovereignty that we will always defend 
in campaign speeches leading up to july 1988 presidential 
elections salinas opposed a freetrade agreement with the united 
states but the uscanada agreement and the pending european plan 
have posed new threats of competition to mexicos export market

miramax films said tuesday it would sue the 
motion picture association of america in hopes of getting the x 
rating rescinded for tie me up tie me down 
a statement issued by miramax said the suit to be filed 
wednesday in new york accuses the mpaa of being motivated by a 
prejudice toward foreign films and a prejudice toward independent 
distributors as well as a bias in favor of films released by major 
studios 
asked to comment on the announcement late tuesday mpaa 
officials in los angeles referred calls to the organizations new 
york office which was closed 
tie me up tie me down in which a lovesick man kidnaps a 
fading movie star was directed by spanish filmmaker pedro 
almodovar the director also made the offbeat comedy women on the 
verge of a nervous breakdown which in 1989 received an academy 
award nomination for best foreign film 
the mpaa doesnt publicly announce a reason for giving the 
rating which means no one under 17 is permitted to see the movie 
but a passionate lovemaking scene is believed the reason 
on april 24 miramax appealed the decision to the mpaas rating 
appeals board which upheld the rating on a 66 vote the suit 
alleges the decision was arbitrary and capricious 
in 1968 the mpaa and the national association of theater owners 
devised the voluntary system under which filmmakers submit their 
movies to be rated 
filmmakers have the option of releasing a film unrated and 
that was done with tie me up tie me down 
amanda marashinky a publicist at miramax noted that many 
theaters wont show xrated or unrated pictures and that many 
newspapers wont accept advertising for them 
i think a lot of people have brought up the fact that it isnt 
really voluntary marashinsky said 
in the past few months wild orchid henry portrait of a 
serial killer and the cook the thief his wife amp her lover 
another miramax film have also been rated x last year the 
miramax film scandal was rated x but reduced to r 
after an orgy scene was recut 
marashinsky said the distributor is seeking an r rating for 
the film meaning that no one under 17 would be permitted in the 
theater without being accompanied by an adult 
tie me up tie me down opened may 4 in new york and los 
angeles and is also being shown in theaters in miami and fort 
lauderdale fla marashinsky says the film which opens wide on

bill cosby invited to address black 
graduates at the university of notre dame drew anger and tears 
when he publicly criticized a football player for failing to attain 
a 30 gradepoint average 
i was in shock kenneth b durgans director of minority 
student affairs said tuesday i understood the underlying 
message but he was really offbase 
cosbys remarks made sunday before about 300 people mostly 
black graduates and their guests went largely unnoticed beyond the 
room until those present voiced their anger this week 
a spokesman for cosby in los angeles david brokaw couldnt 
immediately provide comment from the entertainer 
cosby delivered an upbeat and humorous speech at the 
universitys commencement later sunday the earlier smaller group 
had expected a message of challenge and congratulations 
he said essentially that if you do not give 100 percent of 
your effort and attempt to exploit your potential each and every 
day that youre compromising said william p sexton vice 
president of university relations who attended the meeting and 
when you do that you get into a habit and its a habit thats 
hard to break 
when we left there he said i cannot be party to celebrating 
any result that has not been part of the very best effort to reach 
excellence he said 
the unfortunate thing was it became personal sexton said 
i badly regret some of the folks there found it too tough 
robert price a 22yearold architecture student and member of 
the campus black cultural arts council said at first he thought 
cosby was joking 
i was saddened by the whole thing really unimpressed said 
price i was utterly insulted the person sitting next to me was 
in tears 
durgans and price said cosby singled out football tackle dean 
brown 
he asked him whats your grade average and he said 
25 said price cosby said thats nothing 
during the exchange that followed brown began crying and cosby 
brought him onto the auditorium stage price said adding that 
brown tried to explain to the actorcomedian his difficulties in 
balancing studies and football 
no one answered the telephone at browns dormitory tuesday and 
college officials were unable to provide his whereabouts 
another student came to browns defense and began arguing with 
cosby then walked out said price 
in all fairness to cosby he had a rationale said 
durgans i think a majority didnt agree with how he dealt with 
his rationale 
in los angeles cosby spokesman brokaw noted that cosby has 
donated millions of dollars for black higher education and has 
criticized alumni of black colleges for not helping more

lucien bouchard followed up his resignation from 
the cabinet by quitting prime minister brian mulroneys 
conservatives on tuesday and declaring that he thinks quebecs best 
bet is sovereignty in association with canada 
mulroney struggling to stem the damage to his government caused 
by the defection of his old friend and close political ally 
admitted in the house of commons that the future of the meech lake 
accord is in serious doubt 
the proposed constitutional amendment would give all 10 
provinces special powers and recognize quebec as a distinct 
society within canada by law all 10 provinces must ratify meech 
by june 23 or the proposal will expire 
bouchard the former environment minister opposes any change to 
the 1987 accord recommendations for change are now before the 
government 
bouchard campaigned for an independent quebec in 1980 before 
joining mulroney and the tories the 1982 constitution instituted 
in canada did not recognize the largely frenchspeaking province of 
quebec as a distinct society the meech lake proposal remedies 
that omission 
about 67 million of canadas 25 million people live in quebec 
the constitutional dispute over the accord has revived 
independence talk in quebec 
bouchard who was mulroneys chief lieutenant in quebec told a 
news conference tuesday he thinks quebecers must act because the 
country isnt functioning well 
i believe that the solution is sovereigntyassociation he 
said its a term thats never been properly defined english 
canadians refer to separatists this is a cold term we have to 
remake the country 
in the commons mulroney fervently defended meech saying it was 
simply designed to welcome quebec back into the canadian family 
mulroney told commons lastminute efforts to rescue the meech 
lake accord are not going well 
i am advised that the progress has not been substantial he 
said 
in his speech to commons later bouchard advised quebec premier 
robert bourassa not to attend any conference of mulroney and the 10 
provincial premiers to hear a committee report on changes 
he said if bourassa boycotts such a conference he will have 
not just my support but that of all quebecers 
bouchard told reporters if his resignation means stopping a 
compromise that dilutes meech lake i will have done something 
very important 
if my resignation helps some individuals to be realistic in 
what they are doing and to realize once again that its meech all 
or nothing my resignation will have powerfully served the will of 
the people 
sen lowell murray mulroneys personal meech lake emissary 
said bouchards departure may have scuttled the idea of an 
11thhour meeting of mulroney and the 10 premiers to save 
mulroneys cherished constitutional agreement 
lucien bouchards letter of resignation raises the question of 
whether its worthwhile to do this murray said 
in his letter of resignation bouchard scoffed at those who 
would attempt hopefully in vain to convince quebec to come to a 
conference that is boobytrapped in order to wrest from it ultimate 
concessions that could only be humiliating 
the cracks in meech and in mulroneys party spread tuesday 
gilbert chartrand tory member of parliament for verdunsaint 
paul announced he was quitting the party too saying he was 
unable to toe the party line and would be ashamed if he didnt 
speak up against proposed changes to meech 
the charest report prepared by a special committee led by 
quebec tory jean charest produced 23 recommendations last week in 
hopes of producing a meechsaving compromise in the face of 
opposition by some provinces it would have the federal prime 
minister and the provincial premiers state firmly that recognition 
of quebec as a distinct society does not supersede the charter of 
rights it says the federal government should be allowed to promote 
as well as protect linguistic duality 
bouchard vehemently opposes the report

four teenagers were indicted tuesday on 
charges of sexually assaulting a mentally retarded girl more than a 
year ago 
charged were twins kevin and kyle scherzer 19 peter quigley 
and richard corcoran jr with aggravated sexual assault 
prosecutors allege that the scherzers cocaptains of the high 
school football team quigley and corcoran assaulted the girl with 
a broomstick and a miniature baseball bat while nine others 
participated or watched 
defense lawyers dont contest what occurred but say the girl 
consented lawyers for quigley and corcoran deny that their clients 
were actual participants 
essex county prosecutor herbert h tate jr has said the girl 
now 19 is mentally retarded with an iq is between 49 and 67 
the four were arrested last may more than two months after the 
march 1 1989 incident which took place in the scherzers 
basement in glen ridge an affluent suburb 15 miles west of new 
york city 
they have been free on bail pending a grand jury investigation 
the indictment also charges another teenager john maher with 
conspiracy for allegedly asking the victim identified as mg to 
return to the basement the next day 
it charges mari carmen ferraez 19 with witness tampering for 
allegedly contacting the victim in an attempt to have her change 
her story 
and it names as unindicted coconspirators three juveniles 
under arrest in the case and a fourth who has not been charged 
tate said 
prosecutors have asked that the three juveniles charged be tried 
as adults no ruling has yet been made on that request 
tate said the grand jury investigation took so long because of 
the large number of people involved and discovery of the taped 
conversation between ms ferraez and mg also slowing the 
indictment was a recent state appeals court ruling that the victim 
in a separate case is mentally defective only if she is unable to 
understand that others may not have sex with her without her 
consent 
tate said the investigation was continuing but declined to 
elaborate 
defense lawyers say the girl was intelligent enough to have said 
no 
but the grand jury found that mg was one whom kevin 
scherzer and kyle scherzer and peter quigley and richard corcoran 
jr knew or should have known was physically helpless mentally 
defective or mentally incapacitated 
those four are each charged with four counts of firstdegree 
aggravated sexual assault four counts of thirddegree aggravated 
sexual contact and seconddegree conspiracy to commit aggravated 
sexual assault and aggravated sexual contact 
maher is charged with one count of conspiracy ms ferraez with 
two counts of thirddegree witness tampering and fourthdegree 
obstructing administration of law or other government function 
if convicted the scherzers quigley and corcoran face a maximum 
of about 20 years in prison officials said maher faces 10 years 
ms ferraez five

actor marlon brando sat stonefaced tuesday 
as a judge refused to set bail for his son who is charged with 
killing his sisters boyfriend but later spoke emotionally of the 
suffering of both families 
the whitehaired brando sat in the front row of the packed 
courtroom and stared straight ahead as his son christian was 
brought in the two did not acknowledge each other as cameras 
clicked and flashes went off 
william kunstler the civil rights attorney summoned by the 
elder brando to defend his son said the shooting of dag drollet 
26 at the brando estate last wednesday was an accident and that 
christian brando was drunk at the time 
kunstler presented affidavits from friends and neighbors 
including actor jack nicholson who attested to the younger 
brandos good character 
his father is not going to help him flee in any way he 
wants this process to go on kunstler said in requesting bail 
but municipal court judge rosemary shumsky denied bail 
christian brando 32 a welder and treetrimmer was arrested 
after police received an emergency call from his father and rushed 
to the hilltop estate to find the body of houseguest drollet 26 
who had been shot drollet was the boyfriend of cheyenne brando 20 
marlon brando who did not speak during tuesdays hearing later 
declared his sons innocence to reporters 
we see on the television and read in newspapers things that 
are unpronounceably sad said the reclusive actor the 
messenger of misery has come to my house he has also come to the 
house of mr jack drollet the victims father in tahiti and we 
must stand up to it 
to those people who have known this kind of tragic 
circumstances in the world no explanation is necessary and to 
those people who do not know the nature of this acute misery that 
both our families suffer no explanation is possible 
he added my son has been denied bail he has had his day in 
court and we will abide by that the decision will be appealed 
he also thanked the news media for what he called its mostly 
responsible and reasonable presentation of the case 
as he left he was asked to describe his feelings 
theres no way to describe it to you unless youve gone 
through it in your life we must just be strong and the family 
with love and supporting each other will prevail 
christian brando initially told police he shot drollet during an 
argument involving alleged abuse of his pregnant sister 
kunstler the next day issued statements saying the killing was 
an accident in which a gun went off during a struggle 
but in court tuesday deputy district attorney steven barshop 
said pictures of the body and other evidence indicate otherwise 
there was a contact wound and decedent was shot while 
seated barshop said the shot is at a 45degree angle 
decedent is holding a tv changer and a bic lighter negating any 
struggle 
kunstler disputed barshops account of the evidence 
another brando lawyer ronald kuby told the judge the younger 
brando had an alcohol problem in the past had been through a 
detoxification program and was willing to go through another if 
released 
kunstler said christian brandos bloodalcohol reading two hours 
after the shooting was 019 percent which he called one of the 
highest bloodalcohol contents ive seen in a case of this kind 
that is nearly double the states threshhold for drunken driving 
christian brando is not a famous person not a public 
person kuby told the judge he happens to have a famous 
father i beg you to treat him as you would any other person 
without the brando name 
the judge set the next hearing in the case for june 11

thousands of palestinians protesting the murder 
of seven arabs in israel demonstrated tuesday in the occupied lands 
and in neighboring jordan four people were reported killed and at 
least 47 injured

outside the us consulate in arab east jerusalem striking 
palestinians shut down schools and shops in the occupied gaza strip 
and the west bank

burned effigies of israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and of 
us jordanian and saudi leaders during a march in beirut lebanon 
israeli troops killed two palestinians and wounded 22 tuesday 
raising the toll since sunday to 13 palestinians slain and more 
than 800 injured that does not include seven palestinians killed 
sunday by an israeli civilian an incident that touched off 
widespread riots israel said he was deranged 
president bush extended personal condolences tuesday to the 
families of the seven slain palestinians and those killed later by 
security forces and asked the israeli army to act with maximum 
restraint 
bush said the political problems at the heart of the 
arabisraeli conflict must be urgently addressed and a peace 
process opened that involves all parties 
in jordan at least two people were killed and 25 wounded as 
police fired to disperse demonstrations in two cities and baqaa 
refugee camp near amman the capital jordans official petra news 
agency said prime minister mudar badran pledged to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee safety and order 
nearly half of jordans 31 million people are palestinians who 
fled israel in the 1948 or 1967 middle east wars 
shamir defended his government against criticism by arabs and 
the us state department over sundays slayings and the heavy 
casualties caused by army gunfire 
anyone wishing to see in this mad murder an expression of 
israeli government policy and intentions is maliciously and 
viciously distorting the picture shamir told legislators from 
his rightwing likud bloc 
state department spokesman richard boucher complained about the 
number of casualties caused by the israeli army and department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler told reporters it is the united 
states deeply held belief that absence of a peace process 
contributes to violence in the middle east 
motti amichai a spokesman for israels foreign ministry 
replied the main obstacle to peace in the middle east is the 
refusal of arab states to start direct dialogue with israel 
we are suprised visavis the attempt to link the actions of 
one lunatic to the peace process and the policy of the government 
of israel he said 
the protests in israel started soon after an israeli man lined 
up 50 palestinian day laborers in a tel aviv suburb sunday and 
opened fire with an assault rifle seven people were killed and 11 
injured 
authorities say the suspect 21yearold ami popper was 
deranged and also upset by an unhappy love affair but arabs have 
said antiisraeli policies by shamirs government encourage such 
attacks 
israeli officials in turn have accused the arabs of trying to 
use the slayings to revive the flagging 29month palestinian 
uprising against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
about 7000 palestinians clashed with police tuesday in jordans 
baqaa camp and security officials said 15000 protested in irbid

rocky graziano who briefly held the 
middleweight boxing crown but was better known as the subject of a 
movie and a pitchman for products from yogurt to auto mufflers 
died tuesday he was 71 
graziano died of cardiopulmonary failure at new york hospital 
said hospital spokeswoman diana goldin he was hospitalized april 8 
after suffering a stroke 
in his 11year pro career graziano managed a 6716 record with 
52 knockouts he is best remembered for three fights with tony zale 
and it was the middle one of those which gave graziano his only 
title 
in retirement graziano became as popular as he had been as a 
fighter 
his life story somebody up there likes me was a 
bestselling book that was made into the 1956 movie of the same 
name starring paul newman 
graziano was frequently seen on television as a sidekick to 
comedienne martha raye and on commercials for all manner of 
products from yogurt and foot powder to dog food and auto mufflers 
he was elected to the boxing hall of fame in 1971 
graziano turned pro in 1942 and by 1946 he was a contender on 
sept 16 in yankee stadium he fought zale for the middleweight 
title and they staged a small war with graziano going down in the 
first round and then being knocked out in the sixth he recalled 
the knockout punch 
it was a big left hook and i see it coming but i cant stop 
it it was like the ground exploded up and hit me in the stomach 
the lights spin in a circle then dim down to a tiny little spot 
he said i try to yell but i cant make a sound i am deaf and i 
cant talk and i cant lift my arms and i am falling for the first 
time in my life i know what its like to be kod 
the fight was such a crowdpleaser that 10 months later on july 
16 1947 graziano and zale had a rematch this time in chicago 
graziano returned the favor knocking zale out in the sixth round 
to capture the championship 
graziano held the title for 11 months but in his first defense 
zale took the crown back on june 10 1948 with a thirdround 
knockout in another bloody battle 
graziano got one more chance at the championship but was 
knocked out in the third round by sugar ray robinson on april 16 
1952 he would fight just once more losing a 10round decision to 
chuck davey before announcing his retirement 
twentyfive years after his last fight graziano chortled about 
his postboxing popularity 
this author stuff tv and the movies its a piece of cake 
better than ripping off stores pays better too 
graziano often made himself and his delinquent childhood the 
butt of jokes i quit school in the sixth grade because of 
pneumonia he once said not because i had it but because i

bob graziano grew up as a street brawler who learned to steal 
before he learned to read he ran with a tough crowd and recalling 
those days later in life he called himself the worlds champion 
punk

mayor david dinkins on tuesday urged new yorkers 
to put aside racial antagonism and rededicate themselves to the 
values of justice opportunity and caring 
the public condemnation of racism the second in 12 days by the 
citys first black mayor follows a series of events that have 
heightened racial tensions in the city 
we will never get ahead if we are fighting each other for 
crumbs falling from the table of opportunity dinkins told a 
rally of 6000 
the powerless are trying to prove their power by hurting those 
who are just as powerless it must stop and it must stop now 
the most recent irritant to race relations was a pair of 
verdicts in the socalled bensonhurst case the killing of a black 
teenager by a mob of white youths 
one white teenager was convicted of killing a black youth 
during a gang attack in a predominantly white section of brooklyn 
in august a codefendant was acquitted of murder in the case but 
convicted of lesser charges 
a black boycott of a koreanamerican owned grocery store in 
brooklyn and a speech by a city university professor who espouses 
white supremacy also have brought recent frontpage headlines 
dinkins in announcing the citysponsored unity rally on monday 
said a silent majority needed to be heard above the voices of 
some activists who have been fueling instead of soothing tensions 
wherever you come from or whats been done to you you have no 
right to lash out against others dinkins told the rally tuesday 
night at the cathedral of st john the divine 
im tired of hatred ive seen too much of it too much pain 
and too much suffering and im sick of it so let me be blunt i 
need your help 
gov mario cuomo urged new yorkers to turn crisis into 
opportunity 
we need to refocus our hostility away from one another and 
onto the governments policies that neglect people in need cuomo 
said 
mr president read our lips we need your help and we are 
entitled to it 
cardinal john oconnor head of the roman catholic archdiocese 
of new york told the rally i will unite every single day with 
the religious political leaders of this city i will spend every 
waking moment and as much as possible of every night to try to help 
achieve unity 
the speeches regularly interrupted by standing ovations and 
cheers were broadcast live on local television 
inside the cathedral 2800 people were seated and at least 2000 
more stood while another 1000 listened to the speeches outside 
via loudspeakers said paul gorman a cathedral spokesman 
the mood inside was jubilant among a crowd that was about 
onethird black onethird white and onethird hispanic and asian 
and crossed all lines of age and occupation 
about a dozen black demonstrators picketed outside refusing to 
talk to reporters and holding signs that read lets take our 
peace justice and unity rally to bensonhurst that is the mostly 
white neighborhood where the august gang attack occurred and where 
blacks marching last weekend were pelted with obscenities and 
pieces of watermelon 
keith mondello 19 was acquitted of murder and manslaughter 
friday but convicted of lesser charges in the aug 23 attack on 
16yearold yusuf hawkins on thursday joseph fama also white and 
also 19 was convicted of murder in the hawkins slaying

united nations the un security council will meet friday in 
geneva to hear plo chairman yasser arafat because the us 
government has not granted him a visa to speak in new york the 
arab league announced late tuesday 
yes we definitely will go to geneva said clovis maksoud 
permanent observer of the 22nation league of arab states he made 
the statement to reporters as the security council held informal 
consultations on an emergency meeting to discuss violence in israel 
and the occupied territories 
the council was expected to make a formal statement later 
the us government had not accepted or rejected the request for 
a visa for the palestine liberation organization leader 
but arab diplomats indicated the united states did not oppose a 
move to geneva 
the plo requested an immediate us visa for arafat who is 
considered the head of the palestine state to address the security 
council in new york 
arab envoys said they decided on the geneva move in order to 
consider the pressing issue of how the council can help safeguard 
the rights of palestinians 
we do not seek confrontation we are seeking protective 
measures for the palestinian people maksoud told reporters we 
did not back down no deal has been done with the united states on 
not forcing the visa issue 
arafat last visited the united states in 1974 when he addressed 
the general assembly on palestine 
two years ago the united states refused to grant him a visa to 
address the assembly about the palestine problem on grounds his 
was a terrorist organization the assembly in defiance shifted the 
159nation assembly to geneva to hear him 
there in december 1988 arafat delivered a speech that opened a 
new chapter in middle east diplomacy he renounced terrorism and 
implicitly recognized israels right to exist within secure borders 
as a result of his statement the united states opened a 
dialogue with the plo in tunis 
the security council has met outside new york only twice in 
january 1972 in addis ababa ethiopia to discuss african matters 
and march 1973 in panama city to discuss the panama canal

when record company mogul morris levy died 
he left a legacy of shady dealing in a career that spanned more 
than 40 years 
levy who died monday of cancer at age 62 was facing a 250000 
fine and 10 years in prison for a may 1988 conviction on two 
federal counts of conspiring to extort 125 million from a 
pennsylvania record wholesaler 
free on bail levy tried to have his sentence reduced to zero in 
january because of his failing health although that was denied he 
eventually was granted a 90day stay and would have reported to 
jail on july 16 
levy owned several nightclubs in the 1940s and 50s including 
the world famous jazz mecca birdland in new york he became active 
as a music publisher and record company owner in the 1950s 
his company roulette records produced such hits in the 1950s 
as why do fools fall in love and peppermint twist and 
helped develop such stars as tommy james 
in the 1970s levy entered the record retail business and opened 
a chain of strawberries record shops in the northeast eventually 
he became linked to organized crime 
in a case authorities called an example of how the mob was 
trying to infiltrate the recording industry levy roulette 
comptroller howard fisher and reputed genovese crime family member 
dominick canterino were charged with the attempted shakedown of 
record wholesaler john lamonte of darby pa 
levy denied the allegations but after a threeweek trial in 
federal court in camden nj a jury convicted levy fisher and 
canterino 
levy appealed but a federal appeals court upheld the conviction 
in october 
prosecutors had presented hours of taped conversations obtained 
by government wiretaps at levys office and other locations 
fbi documents filed in the case said government agencies 
believed levy a selfmade millionaire had been involved with 
organized crime for 20 years 
levy had been the principal shareholder of beckzack corp which 
owned the 81store strawberries chain he sold the chain last year

yasser arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization wanted the bush administration to allow 
him to attend a un security council session in new york city 
us officials said tuesday 
but the question apparently became moot during the evening the 
arab league said in new york the security council would meet in 
geneva to hear arafat as it did once before and an announcement 
was expected from un officials 
arafat made an indirect request for an entry visa in a letter to 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar with the expectation 
it would be passed on to the state department 
the united states denied arafat a visa two years ago for a 
similar mideast debate at the united nations 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said no 
decision had been made because the situation was hypothetical 
it would remain hypothetical if the department passed word back to 
the plo that the visa request would be denied 
were hearing reports a formal application will be made but 
as of this briefing we have not received anything margaret d 
tutwiler the state department spokeswoman told reporters at 
midday 
if arafat had gone to the united nations the plos stature 
would have been elevated dramatically that would come at a time 
when israel is being pressured even by friends such as the united 
states because of the force it has used to try to stem a violent 
uprising by palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
when the reagan administration refused to allow arafat to attend 
a un general assembly session in november 1988 the debate was 
shifted to geneva a month later in an electrifying reversal of 
policy the administration opened talks with the plo 
arafat following us instructions had publicly renounced 
terrorism and said he recognized israels right to exist however 
the plo covenant still calls for dismantling the jewish state 
the state department told congress in march that the plo was 
adhering to its commitment renouncing terrorism 
in denying the plos application for a visa in 1988 despite 
overwhelming pressure from many other un members thensecretary 
of state george p shultz said the us government has convincing 
evidence that plo elements have engaged in terrorism against 
americans and other targets 
shultz also said that arafat knows of condones and lends 
support to such acts and is an accessory to such terrorism 
a month later shultz took the lead in opening us talks with 
the plo those talks are continuing in tunis the plo headquarters 
through egypt the plo has registered its terms for talks between 
palestinians and israel in cairo 
secretary of state james a baker iii has been unable to 
persuade israel to adopt the terms participation by exiled 
palestinians and by residents of east jerusalem 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir is trying to shut the plo 
out of the elections he has proposed for the west bank and gaza 
arafat speaking monday in baghdad iraq appealed to president 
bush to pressure israel to stop what the plo chairman described as 
atrocities against palestinians 
arafat rejected israeli claims that the lone israeli gunman who 
shot and killed seven palestinian workers near tel aviv on sunday 
was mentally unbalanced he accused shamir of planning a criminal 
scheme against the palestinians and the intefadeh 
intefadeh is the arab name for the revolt against israels 
control of the west bank and gaza which were surrendered by jordan 
and egypt in their 1967 war against israel

peggy lipton costars on twin peaks yet 
even she doesnt know who killed laura palmer i dont know if 
anyone on the cast knows she says 
hard to believe given that someone on the show must have done 
it unless it was the bird and the bird was killed off in last 
weeks episode or maybe it was the dancing dwarf who spoke in 
reverse 
who knows but abc promises that if you watch tonights season 
finale youll know and the murder of 17yearold laura the 
driving force behind the new show with more twists than a road 
through the cascades will finally be resolved 
i dont think there is a plot line says miss lipton asked 
to explain the disjointed maneuvers of twin peaks one of the 
most publicized programs in television history its like life 
sometimes it doesnt make sense 
miss lipton plays worldweary norma jennings owner of the 
towns double r diner who is torn between two men one of them 
named big ed 
its a long way from the smokyvoiced bellbottomed julie 
barnes of tvs the mod squad 
you remember that show miss lipton michael cole and clarence 
williams iii running down an alley in the programs title sequence 
from 1968 to 1973 they played hip antiestablishment cops while 
williams spent much time uttering the word solid whenever 
confronted with something totally cool 
miss liptons role consisted mostly of looking sullen behind 
stringy blond hair and misting up every now and then she faded 
from view with the shows demise appearing on television only in 
mod squad reruns and a dismal 1979 television movie dubbed 
return of the mod squad 
after more than a decade of selfimposed exile miss lipton has 
returned her children more than half grown her marriage to 
legendary record producer quincy jones long over the actress who 
was 18 years old when she filmed the mod squad pilot is grown up 
secure and finally ready to stand on her own 
when i was doing mod squad i was really very insecure 
says miss lipton sitting in a hollywood office where she has just 
finished a photo shoot that had her lounging seductively on a 
porsche i really didnt like myself very much 
for more than 10 years after mod squad left the airwaves 
miss lipton devoted herself to her husband and her two daughters 
my mother was a career woman who wasnt home enough she says 
i never wanted my children to have that yearning 
with the exception of return of the mod squad miss lipton 
did not pursue acting again until 1985 she made a couple of 
forgettable movies divorced jones and did a lot of auditions 
people were usually very curious she said of reactions to 
her reemergence in hollywood as something other than jones wife 
but it was not until the actress met david lynch the quirky and 
decidedly different director who made blue velvet 
eraserhead and elephant man that she felt something click 
lynch and former hill street blues writer mark frost were 
about to film the pilot for twin peaks and somehow miss lipton 
was called to audition 
i dont even know if david knew who i was she says mark 
frost brought up my name someone told me later that i read for the 
part but i was so nervous i didnt remember 
she got the part as did other actors who had vanished from the 
public viewing eye for awhile michael ontkean from the rookies 
television show of the 1970s was cast as doughnutloving sheriff 
harry s truman richard beymer of west side story became 
hotelier benjamin horne 
and on the set of twin peaks the cast that also includes 
piper laurie joan chen from the oscarwinning the last emperor 
and kyle maclachlan of blue velvet found themselves in a 
surreal environment 
while we were shooting it was like a film within a film 
says miss lipton who is now 42 id never seen a crew like that 
so quiet so tuned in to david that they watched his every move 
there was not a lot of set talk all these people were quite 
mysterious 
not to mention the characters they portray from a logtoting 
woman called simply the log lady to piefixated fbi man dale 
cooper to the onearmed man that dancing midget and lauras mom 
who has psychic visions 
take a dramamine watch the final episode tonight and get ready 
for more abc announced this week that twin peaks despite its 
mediocre ratings has been picked up for the fall season

in the 1980s the american people learned the 
wonderful uses of debt government business and personal the 
underlying urge in all three being the ability to buy things now 
not later 
they also learned the penalties especially as high interest 
rates denied them the opportunity not just to buy for the future 
but to finance the present and the past as well 
the grammrudman act forced government to at least attempt 
scaling back and the phasing out of tax deductions on installment 
debt has made individuals more conscious of saving rather than 
spending 
but business debt is another matter it is still encouraged at 
least by the tax system 
at a time when concerns about corporate debt make news every 
day us tax policy continues to encourage borrowing over the 
oldfashioned way which is to finance through equities or the 
sale of ownership shares to the public 
consider the ways 
for corporations interest payments on borrowed money is a 
taxdeductible expense but payment of dividends to shareholders is 
not 
owners of common stock are taxed twice first when corporations 
pay taxes on profits and again when shareholders pay taxes on 
dividends and capital gains but interest on bonds is taxed only 
once as income to the bondholder 
the 1986 tax act raised the maximum capital gains tax rate to 
33 percent from 20 percent while lowering the maximum rate on 
ordinary income including income from interest to 33 percent from 
50 percent 
the situation causes wright investors service among others to 
warn that changes should be considered in corporate taxation if 
not specifically for the good of corporations then for the good of 
the entire economy 
it argues that while the high corporate debt doesnt assure a 
recession it certainly increases the risk and potential severity 
of the consequences in terms of bankruptcies and job losses 
in addition the first defense against inflation is greater 
productivity which means capital investment in new techniques new 
plants new equipment but capital investment is hardly encouraged 
by the tax law 
this is the direction of corporate debt 
nonfinancial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross 
national product rose to 67 percent last year from 47 percent 20 
years earlier and 39 percent 30 years ago 
in the 20 years through 1989 the ratio of interest expense to 
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent 
in the late 1980s half of all funds raised by nonfinancial 
corporations came from debt issues with the other 50 percent from 
equity offerings but as recently as the 1960s and 1970s the 
average was only 24 percent debt 
why debt was encouraged by the tax law in corporate matters 
while discouraged elsewhere in the economy is one of the mysteries 
of socalled tax reform junk bonds and their collapse can be 
traced directly to it 
not just junk bonds but other techniques for overleveraging 
that preceded the savings and loan crisis have their roots in tax 
law that in turn has led to a selfimposed tight money policy by 
banks relatively high interest rates and a sluggish economy 
could this be what the tax reformers had in mind

his apartment door last june 10 
even before soldiers and tanks rolled into central beijing on 
june 3 to end popular protests for democracy rens name had been 
raised in private official meetings as one of the very few 
counterrevolutionaries who eventually would be blamed for the 
whole movement 
friends alerted him but ren said may 27 after a last meeting 
with foreign journalists that he wasnt running 
this is my freedom of speech said the skinny bespectacled 
accountant who for six months had been writing and distributing 
essays calling for human rights and the rule of law 
i must speak it is my fate to do these things 
nine months after his arrest ren now 45 was charged with 
counterrevolutionary incitement with his prison record four years 
served for participating in a 1978 democracy movement he is likely 
to get more than the minimum five years 
i keep having this vision that ren comes home and im not 
there and he cant get in his wife zhang fengying said soon 
after his arrest 
now with hope of an early release gone friends say she has 
become deeply depressed she has not been allowed to see him only 
to deliver clothes and books 
ren is believed held in qincheng prison western beijing where 
many of last years protesters were sent but it has not been 
confirmed there have been no reports on his condition but before 
his arrest ren predicted he would manage 
im experienced he said 
a little more is known about the fate of wang dan a beijing 
university sophomore who was at the forefront of many marches and 
was arrested in july 
reports from others jailed with him and later released and from 
friends who received a postcard from jail indicate he has enough 
to eat but little exercise and is allowed to read newspapers and 
approved books 
his parents beijing intellectuals were allowed to visit in 
january a rare exception to the usual rule of no visits before 
sentencing 
some reports say wang has shown what authorities call a good 
attitude and may be released but two large prisoner releases 
573 people last winter and 211 in may did not include him 
just before martial law was declared in may 1989 wang then 20 
was impatient when asked if he feared arrest 
didnt he remember wei jingsheng another youth who led a 
democracy movement and has been in jail for 11 years 
how can we worry about one persons safety wang replied 
standing in his dormitory hall with a dinner bowl in his hand 
besides im too busy what can we do anyway if they want to 
arrest us they will 
gao xin a hunger striker released from prison in december 
believes his friend and fellow hunger striker liu xiaobo also 
will be freed 
its as if the government is sifting sand said gao who 
used to edit a university newspaper but has been unemployed since 
his release the little pieces will fall through the sieve i 
fell out early and only the big ones will be charged 
he acknowledged that liu a teacher of chinese literature with a 
passion for politics might be a big piece liu returned from 
new york where he planned to lecture at columbia university to 
take part in the spring democracy movement 
official media have singled him out frequently the government 
even compiled a slim paperback volume of criticism of the crazy 
turmoil inciter 
liu 34 has not been charged with anything so far even though 
he has been held since early june his wife and inlaws were 
allowed to visit him in january at qincheng prison a good sign 
gao said and found he had put on weight from lack of exercise 
he is allowed to read books sent from home reports are that he 
like most of the other intellectuals receives better treatment 
from guards than common criminals and is not physically abused 
despite the releases arrests continue chinese sources said 
police went to the home of a college teacher last month and told 
him to come for a walk he never returned 
a few dissidents still write political tracts and plant them 
cautiously in bicycle racks and public places but they meet only 
in very small groups of trusted friends and have no immediate plans 
for protests or acts of sabotage 
some wouldbe activists make pilgrimages to beijing seeking 
leadership recently a 20yearold worker got off a train from the 
south and began looking for an armed rebel group without 
success none is known to exist 
in our country there arent many people willing to sacrifice 
themselves he said disconsolately i am willing 
sacrifice is more prosaic for the wife of one jailed protester 
without his income she faces financial difficulty she has had to 
send their child to her parents and fears losing their apartment 
she said she is willing to deal with those problems because 
while he is in jail i should sacrifice 
when he comes out she said ill dance up a storm

the odds are daunting for the 400 or so 
candidates who will challenge incumbent congressmen this november 
chances are fewer than a dozen will win 
discontent over the pay raise that house members voted 
themselves talk of a tax increase and ethical lapses could spell 
trouble for some members of congress 
but over the years few bets have been safer than a house 
incumbents reelection the success rate has been as high as 98 
percent in recent years and many believe the reelection rate will 
approach that figure this time around 
the two parties are jostling over about 30 open seats where 
no incumbent is running but otherwise this fall generally is 
viewed as a warmup for 1992 
thats when the pattern should break the redrawing of 
congressional districts and a surge in retirements will reshape the 
house giving republicans a rare chance to regain a house majority 
or to come close 
currently the house is controlled by democrats by a 257176 
margin with two vacancies 
basically the parties have written off the house in 1990 and 
are putting all their energies into 92 said thomas mann of the 
brookings institution a liberal think tank 
with all the advantages available to members of congress high 
reelection rates have become the norm for house races much more 
so than for senators 
members of congress have an arsenal of weapons to keep their 
names in front of voters taxpayerfinanced mail privileges a 
staff to help solve constituents problems ready access to news 
coverage and an overwhelming advantage in raising money 
lets face it said rep john g rowland rconn you have 
to be a bozo to lose this job 
some call this the permanent congress it is at the heart of 
political debates over campaign finance reform redistricting even 
proposals to limit house and senate members to 12 years in office 
rowland who is running for governor is among the handful 
bypassing likely reelection republicans stymied by 36 years in 
the minority are more frequently departing the house for other 
offices eight are running for the senate this year 
for those who choose to remain the odds are good 
the rate of reelection has been 98 percent or better in the 
last two election years and it was 96 percent in the face of the 
1984 republican presidential landslide the rate hasnt dipped 
below 90 percent since 1974 the watergate year that swept 
republicans out of congress 
over the last two election years only 15 out of more than 800 
candidates who challenged incumbents were successful 
a challengers best chance to overcome the odds comes when 
scandal befalls the incumbent of the seven incumbents who were 
defeated in 1988 four had been implicated in scandal 
scandal already has claimed one seat this year republican 
donald e buz lukens of ohio lost renomination after he was 
convicted on misdemeanor charges for having sex with a 16yearold 
girl 
but even a sex scandal doesnt necessarily end a house career 
democratic rep barney frank of massachusetts who admitted he had 
a relationship with a male prostitute is given a good chance of 
winning reelection this year 
both parties congressional campaign committees have targeted 
some incumbents for defeat based on scandal or other 
vulnerability among those considered vulnerable are the 22 
democrats and 20 republicans who were elected with 55 percent or 
less of the vote in 1988 
democrats for example hope to oust rep denny smith rore 
who won reelection by just 707 votes last time is on the hit list 
of a national abortionrights group and has become enmeshed in the 
savings and loan problems 
republicans see an opportunity to oust some potentially 
vulnerable democrats but also must defend the seats vacated by 
their senate candidatesmost of their best opportunities are for 
vacant democratic seats 
their other targets include three north carolina democrats whose 
districts always produce squeakers 
the pay raise congress voted itself late last year could emerge 
as an issue for challengers even though republican and democratic 
leaders agreed to a nonaggression pact to win its passage 
some challengers are using the issue anyway it is blamed for 
the surprisingly close scrape veteran rep john murtha dpa had 
in his recent primary 
president bushs apparent willingness to consider tax increases 
as part of a budget solution could confound some republican 
candidates plans to attack democrats as tax raisers ed rollins 
head of the republican congressional campaign committee called the 
tax talk a disaster for his candidates 
charles cook who publishes a political newsletter argues that 
a surprise may be in store for incumbents of both parties this year 
congress he figures has taken a beating over the pay raise 
savingsandloan scandals sex scandals and attention on speech 
fees and campaign money since speaker jim wright was forced to 
resign 
a potentially explosive combination of unrelated events and 
news stories with a single common thread are all extremely 
unflattering to congress cook said the result may well be a 
reelection rate closer to the normal 94 percent to 96 percent 
range 
both parties need skillful challengers to exploit any 
possibilities and recruiting good candidates has been a problem 
republicans in particular have had trouble and their longtime 
minority status in the house is only one reason 
its much easier for democrats to recruit a candidate than for 
the republicans said rep mickey edwards dokla republicans 
tend to be people who want government out of their lives 
theyre just not inclined 
money is the big obstacle for any challenger specialinterest 
political action committees or pacs tend to direct their money to 
the candidate most likely to win 
political campaigns today are determined by money media and 
personal influence said harold coker a republican who lost a 
1988 challenge in tennessee if you are in you have access to 
it all but if you are out youre just out of luck 
the high success rate for incumbents who seek reelection 
doesnt mean there isnt turnover in congress since some members 
opt to run for other office or retire 
the median number of terms served by house members in the 
current congress is just five or 10 years said the brookings 
institutions mann 
the changes expected in 1992 may bring as many as 80 to 100 new 
members redistricting will encourage retirements and could pit 
some incumbents against one another 
other incumbents may decide to take the money and run since 
1992 is the last year they can pocket their unspent campaign 
treasuries upon retirement

one of the nations top cops reuben m 
greenberg is on the most wanted list of two historic southern 
port cities eager to keep him fighting crime on their streets 
the innovative officer is the onceandfuture police chief of 
charleston sc hes also midway through a sixmonth contract as 
public safety director in this bustling coastal city 
charleston expects him back in july mobiles leaders want him 
to stay 
people have got to stop zeroing in on me as the magic man 
said greenberg the author of lets take back our streets 
which details the law enforcement philosophy that has made him so 
popular on the lecture circuit 
his methods have worked like magic in charleston the murder 
rate is half what it was when he arrived in 1982 the overall crime 
rate has dropped more than 35 percent 
will his methods work in mobile a city with 2 times as many 
people and almost six times as much crime as charleston thats 
what greenberg is here to find out if his streetlevel assault is 
effective here it might work in new york or los angeles too 
greenberg does it by putting cops where the crime is in 
housing projects on street corners in front of crack houses and 
outside hotels where prostitutes take their customers 
he works to win the trust and cooperation of innercity 
residents who have lost faith in the system and have come to expect 
crime as part of their daily lives 
theyve given up whole sections of the city to the criminal 
element said greenberg 47 who arrived in mobile on feb 1 with 
the blessing of charleston mayor joseph riley jr 
its bad but it wasnt worse than what i expected he said 
what is worse than i expected is the willingness of the people to 
accept criminal activity id like to push down those 
expectations 
greenberg himself is somewhat unexpected black balding the 
grandson of a russian jew who emigrated to houston and married a 
black woman the family shortened its name to green and were 
practicing methodists but greenberg changed his name back again 
and converted to judaism 
the chief who holds masters degrees in public administration 
and city planning began his law enforcement career 22 years ago 
the last eight of which he has spent in charleston 
hes as energetic as hell charleston police major edward 
hethington said of greenberg who has taken some of his charleston 
officers to mobile to help train some of this citys force 
mobile is alabamas secondlargest city and greenberg is the 
first black to be placed at the helm of any of the states major 
municipal police forces birmingham the states largest city has 
a black majority and a black mayor but it never has had a black 
police chief or public safety commissioner 
mobiles crime problem mainly involves black perpetrators and 
black victims 
if we could have an impact on crime in the black areas youd 
have a tremendous impact on crime in the city because thats where 
the crime victims are greenberg said half of the rape victims 
in this town are black women almost all of the robbers are blacks 
and their victims are about 70 percent black as well 
early indications are that police in mobile have made headway in 
driving drug dealers out of two housing projects and prostitutes 
off the streets two recent sweeps snared 39 people seeking to buy 
sex in downtown areas long known for illicit sexual activity 
if a drug dealer is controlling a street corner greenberg puts 
an officer on the same corner every day until the dealer goes away 
the result public confidence is restored and the dealer and 
drugrelated crime disappear in the charleston projects there 
were only 18 drugdealing arrests last year 
the key to the thing is at the retail level greenberg said 
thats where you have to hit them 
public housing director james alexander said the two housing 
projects targeted by greenberg were clean as a whistle after 
the public safety commissioner opened police stations inside the 
projects and started chasing drug dealers on scooters 
youll see crime being reduced dramatically in the areas in 
which we control greenberg predicted eventually that will be 
the city as a whole i would want to see it for a sixmonth period 
i wouldnt want to see a month or two months thats 
flashinthepan 
even after a year i wouldnt be satisified until you really 
turn the corner youre going to have two or three years of 
decreasing crime in areas that youre impacting you better hope 
its not increasing in the areas youre not impacting 
part of greenbergs crimefighting strategy is to convince 
ghetto residents that the police will respond to them common 
courtesy on his officers part is one way to do it and greenberg 
sets the example 
he missed his first meeting with me in charleston by 20 
minutes because he stopped to help a woman get her car started 
mobile mayor mike dow said noting that greenberg has his officers 
carry jumper cables in their patrol cars something they didnt do 
before 
hes just very conscious of the public

fuzzy may not seem like a good feature for a 
camcorder but japanese electronics companies say fuzzy logic 
allows their new handheld video cameras to produce sharper 
jitterfree pictures 
the camcorders are the latest in a growing number of japanese 
consumer appliances to incorporate fuzzy logic which uses 
highpowered semiconductors to enable computers to reason more like 
humans and recognize the nuances of the real world 
the trend is yet another example of japanese manufacturers 
taking an innovation developed in the united states and 
incorporating it more rapidly in consumer goods 
most computers can process information only in yesno form 
such as black or white or near or far but fuzzy logic 
allows computers to think in degrees such as medium gray or 
rather close 
to make such distinctions the camcorders are packed with 
technology so much so that analysts say theyre in the same 
league as hardware used in military guidance systems or 
reconnaissance satellites 
in fact the devices share many of the same technologies ccd 
sensors that convert light images to digital signals digital 
pattern recognition circuits sophisticated semiconductors and 
computers all in superminiature size 
a camcorders microcomputer uses fuzzy logic to give more 
accurate autofocusing and autoexposure by responding more 
smoothly and quickly to changing conditions itaru ishizawa of 
sanyo electric co said 
sanyos vmes88 the first camcorder to use fuzzy logic sets 
the lens exposure by dividing the image into 64 parts by 
measuring the relative brightness of each part the camera can 
calculate the best exposure and compensate automatically for strong 
lighting in front or back of the subject he said 
most camcorders focus on whatever is in the middle of their 
field of view but the vmes88s fuzzy logic helps it stay focused 
when a subject moves away from the center ishizawa said 
the 8mm format camcorder weighs 17 pounds and is being sold in 
japan for the equivalent of 1060 sanyo plans to begin marketing 
it in the united states in july and in europe in the fall ishizawa 
said 
pentax is selling in japan under its own brand name a similar 
camcorder made by sanyo it has the additional feature of 
timelapse recording such as one frame every 10 seconds toshihiro 
tanaka of pentax said 
the company plans to begin sales in both the united states and 
europe in the fall he said 
matsushita electric industrials new camcorder takes a different 
hitech tack for sharpening images with an electronic image 
stabilizer 
the stabilizer reduces picture jitter caused by unsteady hands 
by digitally analyzing the cameras images and storing them in a 
memory it detects brief shifts from previous images resulting from 
camera shakes and recalls the earlier image from the memory to 
smooth out the picture matsushita said 
matsushita which uses the panasonic brand name overseas said 
it will begin selling the camcorder called nvs1 in japan next 
month for the equivalent of 1075 the unit which uses vhsc 
tapes weighs 16 pounds 
sony meanwhile has announced a video walkman component set 
with a separate camera deck monitor and tuner that can be used in 
any combination 
the 8mm format set featuring the worlds smallest and lightest 
video deck at 11 pounds and stereo sound will begin selling in 
japan in july for 1070 the company said 
fuzzy logic was first developed in the 1960s by lofti zadeh a 
professor at the university of california at berkeley but has won 
greater popularity in recent years in japan 
it guides elevators and subway trains to smooth starts and 
stops and helps sonys new keyboardless computer recognize 
thousands of handwritten japanese characters 
in recent months it even has appeared in the controls of washing 
machines where it measures the degree of dirt in the clothes and 
amount of laundry and in vacuum cleaners where it calculates the 
quantity of dust and type of floor 
fuzzy logics rapid rise in popularity among japanese 
manufacturers illustrates the fierce technological competition in 
japans marketplace it also shows how japanese companies struggle 
to develop a market for new technologies 
fuzzy logic is a difficult concept to explain to customers 
sanyos ishizawa said we generally explain that its a more 
human way of analyzing information 
the company has produced a videotape he said to explain the 
idea at stores selling the product

gives ibm computers and their clones the same easytouse features 
as the apple computer inc machine 
experts say the newest version of microsofts windows product 
successfully replaces the arcane technical commands of most ibm 
computers with friendly onscreen graphics and a mouse or 
handheld control device 
the development is being hailed by many computer experts as a 
watershed event for the redmond washbased software company led 
by multibillionaire bill gates 
microsoft was scheduled to present its latest windows at news 
conferences today in new york and several other cities in the 
united states and abroad 
in addition to generating a publicity deluge the introduction 
of the new software has grabbed the attention of microsofts 
competitors and pushed the price of microsoft shares to a new 
52week high 
windows could spell trouble for apple by ending the dilemma of 
many computer buyers whether to buy a userfriendly macintosh or 
an ibm or clone which are harder to use but generally cheaper and 
compatible with many office systems 
for apple it means they have seen their innovation lead in 
the market diminished said rick sherlund a computer analyst at 
goldman sachs amp co 
painewebber inc analyst stephen k smith last week downgraded 
his rating of apple stock from neutral to unattractive due 
to windows smith hailed the new product as the biggest software 
development since the advent of 123 the spreadsheet program from 
lotus development corp that is among the most popular computer 
applications 
those opinions helped send apple stock down 175 a share friday 
in national overthecounter trading to close at 3975 while 
microsoft shares also traded over the counter rose 350 to close 
at 6825 on monday microsoft rose 2 more to 7025 apple fell 
25 cents to 3950 after adjusting for a dividend 
coincidentally lotus announced late friday it had called off 
its plan to merge with software maker novell inc the merger was 
seen as providing a viable competitor to microsoft in the personal 
computer software market 
apple meanwhile isnt standing still the cupertino 
califbased company is expected later this year to introduce a 
lowprice version of the macintosh apple also filed a lawsuit 
against microsoft in 1988 contending earlier versions of windows 
and by implication the new version infringe on macintosh 
patents the case is pending 
many experts say the macintosh still is tops for 
graphicsintensive uses such as desktop publishing 
microsoft also denies it is trying to edge out the macintosh 
russ warner who headed the windows development unit says it would 
be crazy for the company to target the 7 percent of the computer 
market that uses the macintosh instead of the estimated 85 percent 
that uses ibm computers and their clones 
were talking about getting those 85 percent to understand the 
benefits of graphics warner said 
most ibm machines and compatibles use an operating system call 
msdos developed by microsoft operating systems allow a computer 
to perform such basic functions as opening files and responding to 
keyboard commands 
but msdos is notorious for its complex series of typed commands 
windows a type of program called a graphical user interface 
shields users from these commands by replacing them with onscreen 
pictures called icons and a mouse 
for example instead of having to type a command telling the 
computer to print a file windows provides a representation of a 
printer the user moves the cursor on the screen to the printer and 
pushes a button on the mouse to print the file 
windows software was introduced in 1985 later followed by a 
second version but computer experts said neither provided a true 
competitor to the macintosh 
the new version which will sell for 149 is vastly better 
they say in addition to providing a graphicsbased way to operate 
computer functions it can run several applications programs at 
once in different sections of the computer screen called 
windows it also greatly expands the amount of computer memory 
microsoft is expected to get a major boost from windows the 
company says the potential market for the software is about 30 
million personal computers already in use 
shearson lehman hutton inc projects windows and related 
products will reap nearly 500 million in revenues for microsoft in 
the fiscal year that starts july 1 
windows also is expected to help companies that make 
applications programs such as word processing and spreadsheets 
because computer users must buy specially tailored versions of 
these programs to gain the advantages of windows microsoft is 
among the major makers of these programs 
windows also is expected to have an impact on an alternative 
operating system for personal computers developed by microsoft and 
international business machines corp called operating system 2 
or os2 
os2 was promoted as a graphicsbased system for ibm personal 
computers when it was introduced in 1987 but it failed to catch on

tougher competition in the automotive 
industry threatens the united auto workers attempt to force a 
common contract on the nations big three automakers some analysts 
say 
for the first time in 11 years contracts between the uaw and 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp will expire 
at the same time midnight sept 14 
but the socalled pattern bargaining that characterized labor 
relations until 1979 may not be feasible in the hotly competitive 
1990s 
in the past decade us automakers have lost market share faced 
financial crises slashed costs joined with japanese companies in 
joint ventures closed factories and trimmed salaried and hourly 
work forces 
the moves were inspired at least in part by competition from 
japanese automakers first with cars imported from overseas and 
later with vehicles made in the united states 
as a result negotiating strategies have changed twenty years 
ago when the big three completely dominated the us market the 
uaw would pick one company as a target settle on a contract and 
then impose the terms the other two 
in turn that contract would serve as a model for other large 
industrial unions including steel and rubber workers 
but dale brickner of michigan state university says those days 
are over 
these firms have different cost factors they have different 
abilities to pay he said monday if a pattern means that you 
are going back to the years of xerox contracts those days are dead 
and gone 
uaw president owen bieber speaking after the first day of a 
threeday union bargaining convention in kansas city disagreed 
were not going to end pattern bargaining he said i just 
moved chrysler last time in 1988 to a common expiration date 
were not going to get off pattern 
in 1979 when chrysler was on the brink of financial ruin the 
no 3 automaker broke from the pattern chrysler today faces fresh 
financial problems and industry observers have said it again is the 
mostly likely company to break the newly revived pattern 
chryslers labor vice president anthony st john recently 
sounded an ominous tone when he said if the current contract is 
continued with no changes it would boost the struggling 
automakers labor costs by 16 percent 
that hinted at the possibility of chrysler seeking concessions 
from the uaw something the union reluctantly swallowed in the 
early 1980s chrysler workers returned to near pay parity with 
their counterparts at ford and gm in 1988 
this years negotiations brickner said will determine 
whether an old econmic pattern will continue at all with the 
japanese in there it aint the same game any more

greyhound lines inc acknowledging the heavy cost 
of a strike by its bus drivers has asked holders of 225 million 
of its junk bonds to sell them back at steep discounts to keep the 
company out of bankruptcy 
the company also said monday it was changing its pay scale for 
drivers and withdrawing proposed bonus and pension schemes to save 
money 
the ability to restructure the balance sheet in some way is 
very important to avoid bankruptcy said michael doyle the 
companys chief financial officer 
the comment marked a dramatic change in tone from just two weeks 
ago when greyhounds chairman confidently declared victory in the 
strike after contract talks failed 
the cost of the strike has been pretty expensive doyle 
said and cash is very tight nevertheless he said the only 
nationwide bus company is able to meet its payroll and buy fuel 
greyhound issued a variety of junk bonds to refinance debt taken 
on in a leveraged buyout three years ago 
the bonds include 150 million due in 1995 that pay interest of 
13 percent and 75 million of 125 percent bonds due in 1997 the 
two issues represented more than half of the companys total debt 
of 359 million at the end of 1989 
the company is technically in default on the first issue after 
missing a recent interest payment and noteholders could force the 
company into bankruptcy 
as a result greyhound said it was making a cash tender offer to 
redeem the 13 percent notes at 54 percent of their face value and 
the 125 percent notes at 275 percent 
doyle said both offers are higher than prices currently quoted 
for the bonds in secondary markets 
the offer is conditional on its acceptance by a majority of 
noteholders plus their agreement of a change in some terms on the 
notes especially those that restrict greyhounds indebtedness and 
call for certain levels of net worth the offer also is conditional 
on greyhound being able to find financing to buy the bonds 
the companys total debt stood at 359 million at the end of 
1989 
most of greyhounds 6300 bus drivers walked out march 2 in a 
dispute over wages and job security greyhound immediately began 
operating a reduced schedule with newly hired drivers 
after attempts to reopen negotiations collapsed chairman fred 
g currey said may 7 the strike had become irrelevant because 
the carrier had enough drivers to operate 
union officials say their strike will continue to hobble 
greyhound and the company will have to return to the bargaining 
table 
last week a national labor relations official suggested the 
company had engaged in an unfair labor practice by instituting its 
contract offer on march 2 such a finding if upheld could force 
the company to rehire union drivers 
greyhound said the strike caused it to lose 56 million in the 
first three months of the year 
the company missed a 975 million interest payment due may 15 
on the 13 percent notes and did not pay about 5 million in leases 
due at the end of april 
those missed payments left the door open for creditors to begin 
proceedings that could force the company into bankruptcy 
this is a way of starting a dialogue with noteholders doyle 
said of the tender offer the company put no time limit on the 
offer although doyle said regulations require it to be open for at 
least 20 business days 
if they were to get this exchange offer off successfully i 
would assume that they would avoid chapter 11 said analyst ken 
frankel with drake capital securities inc in santa monica calif 
if they dont get it off all bets are off 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code companies are 
protected from creditors while they reorganize 
greyhound has hired goldman sachs amp co as a financial advisor 
to help in the debt restructuring 
in another effort to save money greyhound said it would 
implement an hourly wage scale on sept 1 replacing its 
mileagebased scale for drivers 
spokesman george gravley said the change from 30 cents a mile to 
1279 an hour effectively would increase pay for drivers on the 
east and west coasts but flatten or depress wages in the 
middle of the country 
the company also withdrew bonus and pension provisions it had 
proposed but not implemented 
in a letter to all employees vice president p anthony lannie 
said we simply can no longer afford to continue these programs

rupert murdoch angrily denied a trade 
publication report that he is sounding out prospective buyers 
for tv guide and said he offered 1 million to the publications 
parent if it could prove for its story 
advertising age said monday that the head of news corp ltd was 
shopping tv guide around 
rance crain the editor in chief of ad age said he turned down 
the offer to bet me 1 million because it would have required 
revealing the magazines sources 
we stand by the story completely crain said in a telephone 
interview 
news corp acquired tv guide as part of a 3 billion buyout of 
triangle publications inc nearly two years ago that deal also 
included seventeen magazine and the daily racing form 
the report in ad age comes a few weeks after news corp agreed 
to sell star magazine a supermarket tabloid for 400 million in 
cash and securities 
murdoch confirmed in a recent interview that he had no plans for 
additional major acquisitions over the next few years and would 
focus on improving profits at existing operations which include 
magazines book publishing newspapers television stations and the 
fox tv network 
his company has an estimated 6 billion in debt and has lost 
more than 400 million in its effort to launch a satellitetv 
service in great britain 
the ad age story said unidentified publishing industry sources 
have met with a number of major publishers in recent weeks to gauge 
interest in tv guide a weekly magazine that the report said has 
been in an ad page and circulation slump since it was acquired in 
1988 
the story said the asking price is an estimated 26 billion 
but it said informal bids have been in the 15 billion to 2 
billion range 
in a statement which described him as incensed murdoch said he 
has 1 million that says tv guide is not for sale 
murdoch said he had told crain he would pay 1 million to crain 
publications if the story could be verified and if crains could 
bring forth anyone with whom news corp has had discussions 
the statement said murdoch would expect crain publications to 
write news corp a check for a similar amount if support for 
the story could not be provided it said crain declined the offer 
in the statement murdoch said the story had no basis in 
fact 
it said murdoch also said there had been no discussions of a 
sale between either he or any news corp executives with anyone 
either in the publishing or financial community 
crain said ad age had been working on the story for three weeks 
we did not rush into print he said 
he said he had received a letter from a lawyer for news corp 
that demanded the identity of the sources who supplied your 
reporter with this scurrilous gossip 
i think mr murdoch wants me to reveal our sources crain 
said i think if he were in the same boat i dont think he would 
either

the finance minister today rejected 
opposition leaders demands for changes in the new economic treaty 
with east germany and warned that delaying unification could cause 
trigger unrest among east germans 
west german finance minister theodor waigel made his remarks in 
a speech to the upper house of parliament the bundesrat which 
began examining the treaty today 
waigel appealed to the opposition social democrats not to 
attempt to delay the july 2 target date on which the two germanys 
are to be merged into one economic entity 
his comments came a day after hansjochen vogel the social 
democrats national chairman told reporters his party wants to 
negotiate with chancellor helmut kohls government over improving 
the treatys terms for east germans 
the social democrats favor the economic merger but maintain the 
treaty as written is unfair to east germans 
but waigel told the bundesrat that rejection of the treaty could 
result in worsened social and economic conditions in east germany 
a new entrance into the basic discussions on the treatys 
terms could seriously place east germanys economic health in 
question waigel said 
it could also heap up social problems and social 
explosives because of east german hopes for a better standard of 
living after economic union he said 
whoever rejects this treaty must assume the moral political 
and historic responsibiity if german unity is gambled away for a 
limitless time waigel said 
the social democrats position could spell trouble for the 
economic merger treaty which was signed friday at a ceremony in 
bonn 
the treaty must still be approved by the parliaments of both 
countries the social democrats recently won control of the upper 
house in west germanys parliament by defeating kohls christian 
democrats in two key state elections 
the bundesrat is expected to vote on the treaty june 22 the 
lower house or bundestag is scheduled to vote on ratifying the 
treaty on june 21 
volker ruehe the head of kohls christian democrats accused 
the social democrats of displaying an alarming amount of 
irresponsibility 
he appealed to the opposition party not to let in a dangerous 
risk for the future of all germans and not to reject the state 
treaty on economic merger 
vogel told reporters the social democrats cannot accept the 
proposed treaty in its present form because it falls short in 
helping create modern and qualified jobs for east germans and 
guarding against the collapse of east german businesses 
according to vogel the social democrats are demanding changes 
or amendments either within or outside the treaty text 
that seemed to leave open the possibility the treaty could be 
approved as is with additions to be worked out later 
vogel said the social democrats would determine their final 
position on the proposed treaty in light of answers to our 
demands 
the social democrats could use their majority in the upper house 
to slow approval of the treaty however they could also decide it 
is not in their best political interests to actually block the 
merger since that could cost them votes when joint german 
elections are held possibly at the end of this year 
east germanys own social democrats the sister party of the 
west german group say they will not try to block the treaty the 
east german social democrats are part of their countrys coalition 
government and participated in the treaty negotiations 
under the merger treaty west germanys mark will become east 
germanys own legal tender as of july 2 east germany will also 
start scrapping its centrally planned economy for one that mirrors 
west germanys 
thousands of east germans are already worried they could be hit 
hard by their nations economic overhaul many east german 
staterun factories are expected to shut down when they are forced 
to compete in a free market and hundreds of thousands of workers 
are likely to lose their jobs 
the east german government slashed prices on everything from 
blue jeans to television sets monday in a bid to lure back 
consumers enamored with western goods 
hans klein kohls chief spokesman said the government is 
determined to hold to the timetable of putting the treaty into 
effect july 2 
klein also rejected vogels charges the treaty does too little 
to protect east germans from joblessness and other economic shocks 
he said delaying ratification of the treaty could result in 
disappointment among east germans who are eager to get the wests 
powerful mark as their own legal currency

british airways plc said tuesday it reversed a 
loss in its traditionally weak fiscal fourth quarter and increased 
profits by 40 percent for the full year

routes to japan south america and the united states 
british airways said its profit for the three months ended march 
31 was 31 million pounds or 52 million compared with a loss of 2 
million pounds or 34 million in the same period a year ago 
the airlines earnings translated to 38 pence or 6 cents a 
share 
sales rose 13 percent to 112 billion pounds or 19 billion 
from 991 million pounds or 17 billion 
for the full year earnings totaled 245 million pounds or 414 
million compared with 175 million pounds or 296 million a year 
earlier

pence or 39 cents 
sales increased 14 percent to 484 billion pounds or 82 
billion from 426 billion pounds or 72 billion 
the company said its results were boosted by the sale of 11 
aircraft during the year 
staffing costs rose 12 percent while fuel costs soared 30 
percent because of higher world oil prices the airline said 
despite the buoyant earnings british airways chairman lord king 
sounded a note of caution for the year ahead 
we are aware that our costs require constant scrutiny 
particularly in view of the increasingly competitive nature of the 
market we serve and the softening of western economies he said

president mikhail s gorbachevs advisers decided 
today to introduce radical reforms next year to try to salvage an 
economy plagued by massive shortages strikes and ethnic conflicts 
food prices would double but the government would continue to 
regulate the cost of staple items a draft of the planned reforms 
says the reforms would not start until next year and would take 
place over five years instead of the two years discussed earlier 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a news 
briefing the presidential council approved the draft report today 
and that premier nikolai i ryzhkov would present it to the supreme 
soviet parliament on thursday gerasimov did not say whether the 
council had made any changes in the 70page plan obtained by the 
associated press 
the plan falls short of the free market measures in poland that 
led to a spurt of rapid inflation over the past six months 
soviet officials fear that sudden rises in food prices could 
touch off riots and strikes like those that toppled polish 
communist governments in the 1970s and 1980s 
nevertheless the plan is far more radical than the government 
program presented in december to the soviet congress the supreme 
soviets parent parliament 
that plan essentially proposed three more years of a centrally 
planned economy but sentiment is growing that faster steps are 
needed to improve production and distribution 
the negative effect of political instability strikes and 
interethnic conflicts is growing ever stronger ryzhkovs report 
says it appeals to all workers not to strike 
ryzhkovs draft came under immediate fire from a parliamentary 
opposition group which plans to present an alternative economic 
blueprint advocating a market economy 
this is just another ploy to intimidate the people with the 
idea of a free market and consolidate its own positions said 
siberian economist gennady filshin who developed the alternative 
plan for the interregional group he was interviewed by the 
independent news service postfactum 
the government report emphasizes the need to control inflation 
unemployment and other social ills but also outlines major price 
increases and other reforms beginning in 1991 
the retail prices on food should on the average double 
increasing by 112 billion rubles 187 million says the report 
however the prices of basic foodstuffs including bread meat 
and oil will remain under government regulation and not be 
allowed to spiral out of control the plan says 
it also provides for wage indexing to cushion the effect on the 
countrys poor 
frightening figures on current economic performance explain the 
governments new readiness to take harsh measures in the first 
three months of this year cash incomes swelled by 134 percent 
while the gross national product declined the report says 
from january to april political strikes and interethnic 
conflicts led to the loss of 95 million manhours compared to 7 
million manhours lost during all of last year 
the government plan foresees passage of all the laws needed for 
the transition to a market economy by the end of this fall it says 
predictions show that in 1995 the country will be in a position 
to accumulate the real financial means and resources to let the 
economy leap ahead 
current prices in state stores for many basic foods are 
extremely low with potatoes costing as little as 8 cents a pound 
and beef 180 a pound 
the soviet economy is plagued with shortages and free prices at 
farmers markets have rocketed to 16 a pound for beef and up to 
about 8 a pound for new potatoes commodities are rationed in some 
regions

us treasury officials and their japanese 
counterparts ended two days of talks today sharply divided over a 
us request that japan move quicker to lift interest rate controls 
us undersecretary of the treasury david c mulford said the 
japanese refusal to provide a timetable for deregulating interest 
rates on bank deposits within one year could push us regulators 
toward imposing limits on japanese financial activities in the 
united states 
japans reluctance to promise faster liberalization could aid 
passage of a legislation being considered in congress that calls 
for retaliatory action against foreign financial firms in the 
united states if their own governments do not give us companies 
reciprocal treatment he said 
rapid action to complete the deregulation process in japan 
would avoid what otherwise will become an area of serious political 
conflict mulford said 
the treasury is in the process of preparing a national 
treatment study for the us congress on the status of us 
financial firms in foreign financial markets he said as of 
today it will not be possible for the us treasury to give a 
positive report on the japanese market 
vice minister of finance makoto utsumi said the two sides agreed 
on the goals for complete liberalization of japans once strictly 
controlled financial markets but clearly disagreed on the timing 
he likened the process of reform to mountain biking 
the problem is we are now facing the final stage of 
liberalization and the slope is steeper the problems become more 
serious we have to complete the process without causing a heart 
attack he said 
utsumi declined to elaborate on the reasons why japan could not 
provide a timetable for lifting interest rates but said the 
ministry planned to eventually lift all controls on rates for bank 
deposits 
the finance ministry is reportedly considering proposals that 
would stretch the process of lifting interest ceilings to 1993 or 
later far beyond the us proposal for a oneyear deadline 
we believe it is important to complete the process as quickly 
as possible but this mountain bike is like a bicycle built for 
two and whenever we get some speed up the ministry of finance 
puts on the brakes mulford said 
analysts say the ministry faces strong opposition to interest 
rate deregulation from small and mediumsize banks that are 
already facing difficulties due to higher interest rates and 
limited liberalization 
japans central bank has raised its key rate for loans to 
commercial banks from 25 percent to 525 percent in the past year 
in turn commercial banks prime lending rates jumped from about 
55 percent to 72 percent 
the higher rates banks must pay to depositors make it more 
expensive for them to acquire funds for lending and investment 
moreover a reduction in the minimum purchase for money market 
certificates from 62500 to 6250 means banks now must pay 58 
percent interest to a growing pool of depositors compared with the 
075 percent paid on ordinary bank accounts 
utsumi bluntly disagreed with mulfords assertion that interest 
rate controls were in effect subsidizing japanese banks giving 
them a source of artificially cheap capital for loans and other 
investments and enabling them to expand their presence overseas 
to avoid foreign exchange exposure loans overseas are made 
with funds in the same currency the loans are denominated in 
utsumi said 
mulford said some progress had been made in japanese moves to 
expand ceilings on individuals overseas accounts and to allow 
their use for portfolio investment 
he said finance ministry officials had promised to approve new 
foreign exchangerelated and securitized financial products and 
allow foreign securities firms to establish banking facilities to 
handle foreign exchange services 
mulford said the us was pleased by a pledge to approve the use 
of the globex trading system by the end of june 
globex is a global electronic automated transaction system for 
the trading of futures and futures options jointly operated by the 
chicago mercantile exchange and reuters holdings plc

grain and soybean futures prices edged higher in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade amid signs of 
stronger export sales and forecasts for more rain in the midwest 
next week 
the slightly stronger opening represented a modest rebound from 
moderate to sharp losses in mondays session 
analysts attributed the early strength in part to new wheat 
export prospects including a government offer to subsidize sales 
of 2 million metric tons of us wheat to algeria 
the agriculture department also said it had accepted bids from 
private exporters to cover a sale of nearly 400000 metric tons of 
wheat to china at subsidized prices 
mondays weekly usda exportinspections report showed a 
largerthanexpected amount of corn earmarked for export last week 
wheat inspections were about as expected while soybean inspections 
were below expectations 
corn and soybean planting is progressing at a slowerthannormal 
pace according to another usda report released monday and the 
national weather services latest sixto10day forecast predicts 
wetterthannormal conditions in the midwest early next week which 
could further delay planting 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in july at 336 a bushel 
corn futures were cent to 2 cents higher with july at 277 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with july at 153 a

a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 57 cent lower to 05 cent higher with june at 
7440 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 42 cent lower 
with may at 8550 cents a pound live hogs were unchanged to 68

a colorado savings and loan that counted one 
of president bushs sons as a director made inflated loans to 
developers who had to reinvest part of the money in the thrift 
federal regulators said today 
the house banking committee opened two days of hearings on the 
1 billion collapse of the silverado banking savings and loan 
association of denver bushs son neil and other former board 
members are to testify on wednesday 
a panel of thrift regulators told the committee they found a 
quid pro quo lending program at silverado under which 
developers received loans to buy buildings at inflated values set 
by outside appraisers 
the properties values had been inflated 270 million to 300 
million they said 
the regulators told the banking committee that silverados board 
of directors operated as a rubber stamp for management they 
also said insider abuse occurred at the thrift 
because management of silverado took excessive risks engaged 
in abusive or questionable practices to generate shortterm gains 
and undertook innovative manipulations to avoid recording losses 
the role of the directors was even more crucial the regulators 
statement said throughout silverados history the board did 
little beyond rubberstamping the activities of its sophisticated 
bright and manipulative management team 
the panel of regulators testifying today included stephen p 
hershkowitz deputy director of enforcement at the office of thrift 
supervision and brian c mccormally terry sandefur and dorothy 
van cleave of the ots district office in topeka kan 
kermit mowbray former president of the federal home loan bank 
of topeka did not appear and gonzalez said he would ask the 
committee to subpoena mowbray who is in greece 
in exchange for receiving loans bigger than the market price of 
the buildings the developers were required to use the surplus part 
of the loan money to buy preferred stock in silverados holding 
company or to purchase an interest in a loan pool set up by the 
thrift 
the pool which contained both good and bad loans totaled 
around 1 billion or roughly 60 percent of silverados total loan 
portfolio the developers who bought shares in the loan pool 
received interest generated by the performing loans in the pool 
examiners said monday they believed this arrangement was unique 
in the sampl industry 
federal regulators declined to say monday whether the 
appraisers who included accounting firms coopers amp lybrand and 
ernst amp young also were under investigation 
government investigators said monday they believe robert m 
lewis former vice chairman and chief financial officer of 
silverado was the financial guru who probably invented the 
concept of the loan pool 
the december 1988 collapse of silverado now operating as part 
of columbia savings the largest thrift in colorado is expected to 
cost us taxpayers as much as 1 billion total losses from the 
nationwide savings and loan crisis which has forced the government 
to take over more than 400 failed institutions are estimated at 
around 250 billion 
the connections among silverado and other insolvent sampls are 
being examined the others include charles h keating jrs lincoln 
savings and loan association and the junk bond operation of former 
drexel burnham lambert inc financier michael milken 
ots has alleged that loans by silverado to neil bushs business 
partners developers kenneth good and bill walters represented a 
conflict of interest for bush 34 who was a director of silverado 
from 1985 to august 1988 he resigned two weeks after his father 
received the republican presidential nomination 
in january regulators began disciplinary procedures against 
bush that could result in a lifetime ban from the financial 
institutions industry bush who has denied any wrongdoing said 
early this month he will cooperate with congress the ots and any 
other agencies involved 
examiners at the ots have expressed concern about silverados 
heavy investments in colorados ailing commercial real estate 
market 
they also have focused on what they said was an exceptionally 
large number of problem transactions between silverado insiders 
and borrowers 
bush who was a partner in an oil exploration firm jnb 
exploration had business deals with two of silverados major 
borrowers good and walters 
bush has said he did not benefit directly or indirectly from any 
loan or transaction between silverado and businesses controlled by 
walters who had a 625 percent limited partnership interest in jnb 
exploration bush has said he voted in 1986 with the other 
directors in unanimously approving the walters loans brought to 
them by management because there was no conflict of interest under 
federal banking laws or colorado regulations 
good and walters are scheduled to testify at wednesdays hearing 
along with michael r wise the former chairman of silverado 
richard k vanderpool silverados former vice chairman and 
chief operating officer also is expected to appear wednesday 
along with lewis and other former directors besides bush

president bush hinted to republican leaders 
today that he is ready to grant china a oneyear extension of trade 
benefits administration sources said announcement of such a move 
would come this week 
the expected decision to renew beijings mostfavorednation 
status drew advance criticism from democrats 
republican lawmakers who met with bush at the white house said 
the president left the clear impression he was ready to grant china 
the extension 
he indicated he would present that while congress is still in 
session this week said sen alan simpson rwyo 
simpson and other gop leaders said bush made a strong case for 
extending mostfavorednation treatment arguing that to withdraw 
preferential trade status would severely damage the freemarket 
economy of hong kong 
although he did not say exactly what he planned to do bush 
demonstrated a tilt toward granting it but he was seeking our 
views said sen john chafee rri 
sen william armstrong rcolo said he gave us the 
impression he would do it 
bush was to meet with democratic leaders on the subject on 
wednesday 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said a decision on the 
issue would not be announced today 
as far as i know no decison has been taken on whether to 
continue mostfavorednation trading status for china he said 
the spokesman said bush might bring up the topic at todays 
meeting with congressional republicans it is unlikely the white 
house would announce such a move before bush conferred with 
congressional leaders 
however other officials speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the president was expected to notify congress 
formally of the move before the end of the week 
in advance of a white house announcement senate majority leader 
george michell dmaine today strongly criticized renewal of trade 
benefits to china 
should we by now giving the chinese government what it wants 
passively adopt the chinese governments casual dismissal of our 
concerns mitchell said i say we should not because it is 
contrary to our principles contrary to american interests and 
wrong 
mitchell said the bush administration by its actions is 
sowing the seeds of disaster with respect to the next generation 
of leaders in china 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he would withhold 
comment on bushs decision until one is actually announced foley 
said he understood there were conditions attached to the status 
and he wanted to find out what those conditions are i think its 
better to see what he recommends he said 
bush was planning to make the extension provisional based on 
chinas humanrights performance over the coming months said the 
officials 
sen pete wilson rcalif who accompanied bush on the flight 
said he did not expect congress to react as negatively to the move 
as it had last winter when bush vetoed legislation extending the 
visas of chinese students 
its not as emotional an issue wilson said most people 
in the nation dont even know what mfn is 
mostfavorednation mfn trading status guarantees china the 
same treatment as this nations best trading partners including 
the lowest possible tariffs 
this benefit has provided preferential tariffs for about 12 
billion in chinese products shipped to the united states each year 
mostly textiles and toys 
bush is required under law to act one way or another by june 3 
but sources said he would rather deal with the issue now than wait 
until the deadline one day before the first anniversary of chinas 
bloody repression of prodemocracy demonstrators in beijings 
tiananmen square 
the president also would like to clear the boards of the 
decision before the may 30june 3 summit with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev the officials said 
although bush has recently voiced disappointment with chinas 
failure to ease restrictions on dissidents he considers depriving 
china of mostfavorednation status a drastic step that could have 
widespread trade implications the officials said 
bush himself expressed reservations at a news conference last 
week about stripping china of the trade benefits in part out of 
fear it would harm the economy of hong kong 
some 85 billion worth of chinamade goods are reexported to 
the united states each year passing through hong kong officials 
of the enclave on the south coast of china claim revocation of 
chinas mostfavorednation status would make these goods subject 
to tariffs of up to 70 percent 
some nations including the soviet union have been denied 
mostfavorednation treatment because of their restrictive 
humanrights policies 
congress can block bushs decision but it seems unlikely it 
could muster the twothird majorities needed to do so 
bush a former us envoy to china won a bruising veto battle 
with congress last winter on a bill that would have extended the 
visas of chinese students in the united states bush argued that he 
was offering the chinese students the same safe haven though 
administrative actions 
previously the bush administration waived restrictions on us 
exportimport bank financing of business with china and granted 
permission for chinese rockets to launch three usbuilt 
satellites

southmark corp says its san jacinto savings 
association unit is insolvent and wont be able to meet required 
minimum capital levels despite plans to pump more than 100 million 
in assets into the houston savings and loan 
the disclosure monday in a federal securities and exchange 
commission filing raises new questions about southmarks ability to 
keep control of san jacinto after southmark emerges from chapter 11 
bankruptcy 
the real estate and financial services company has proposed 
selling all its remaining holdings except for san jacinto which 
would be the centerpiece of a reorganized southmark 
thrift president and chief executive lawrence connell said the 
thrift is seeking to increase its capital in part through the sale 
of 200 million in real estate that is in negotiation or under 
contract 
the thrift also has asked regulators for a temporary reprieve 
from the minimum capital standards and to delay any actions until 
it can put its business plan into effect 
san jacinto under regulatory oversight since 1988 is one of 
the largest thrift institutions in the state that hasnt been sold 
or seized by federal regulators 
in the third quarter ended march 31 san jacinto reported a loss 
of 672 million causing its shareholders equity to fall to a 
negative 508 million and making the institution insolvent for the 
first time 
it is expected that san jacinto will experience further 
increases in its capital deficit due to continuing operating 
losses southmark noted 
the parent company posted a loss of 585 million for the 
quarter it already had taken a 286 million charge in the quarter 
ended dec 31 for possible loan losses at the thrift 
in the third quarter of 1989 southmark reported a record 1 
billion loss caused by huge writedowns in the value of 
southmarkheld real estate an by provisions for loan losses at san 
jacinto that loss led to the companys filing for protection under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in july 
before the filing southmark reached an agreement with the 
office of thrift supervision which regulates the savings and loan 
industry permitting the company to continue to own the thrift 
while in bankruptcy proceedings as long as it maintained minimum 
capital levels

sock shop international plc will close 58 stores 
more than half its british outlets to try to save the business 
its administrators announced tuesday 
the company closed its 17 us stores in december 
the closure of 58 british stores out of 109 will mean 150 job 
losses the administrators said 
it has been a tough time for the employees of sock shop 
said administrator peter dubuisson 
i believe the steps we are now taking to rationalize the 
company will improve its profitability and reward everyones 
efforts to save sock shop he said 
dubuisson and phillip sykes accountants with the firm bdo 
binder hamlyn were called in three months ago last week a court 
gave them another three months to find a solution to propose to the 
companys creditors 
the administrators are looking for new investors to bail out the 
company which was founded in 1982 by a former typist sophie 
mirman and her husband richard ross 
the company has blamed its problems on last years hot summer 
and transport strikes which discouraged sales many sock shops are 
at train and subway stations 
heavy debts incurred through rapid expansion also took their 
toll as interest rates climbed 
miss mirman opened her first sock shop at londons knightsbridge 
subway station near the harrods department store the company 
prospered during the freespending 1980s with passersby dropping 
in on a whim for a handful of tights or socks 
sock shops expansion to the united states failed because of 
high rents and security costs 
in february the company posted a sixmonth loss of 29 million 
pounds or 49 million

the government and the ruling party on tuesday 
adopted a new economic policy guideline aimed at meeting promises 
made in recent trade talks with the united states 
the new guideline calls for opening japans markets to more 
foreign goods making fiscal and budgetary policy changes to 
conform with other trading partners and increasing foreign aid 
we must push forward the adjustment of japans economic 
structure in order to improve the nations standard of living and 
promote consumer benefits in accordance with world economic 
growth said a government statement 
the policy was adopted by the governmentldp economic structural 
adjustment board which consists of bureaucrats and lawmakers from 
the governing liberal democratic party 
it marks a major revision in the direction suggested for japans 
economy 
a 1986 guideline known as the maekawa report urged a drastic 
shift from heavy reliance on exports to increased domestic demand 
to reduce the countrys trade surpluses 
in recent months however a number of government and ldp panels 
have called for less emphasis on expanding domestic demand and more 
on international cooperation and benefits for japanese consumers 
who now pay some of the worlds highest prices 
the new guideline suggests that japans economy already has been 
transformed to a domestic orientation and notes that its trade 
surplus has been decreasing 
for us to assume a role and responsibilities compatible with 
our position in the international community it is an extremely 
important theme for japan to promote the adjustment of our economy 
to a more internationally cooperative style it said 
in addition to improved living standards the guideline calls 
for shorter working hours and longer vacations 
in its interim report on the usjapan structural impediment 
initiative talks released in april tokyo promised to streamline 
its complicated distribution system tighten the antimonopoly law 
and increase government spending on public works to help improve 
the nations standard of living 
the report said such measures would lead to a reduction of 
japans 49 billion surplus in trade with the united states 
the new guideline like the trade report calls for easing the 
large scale store law which us trade negotiators say makes it 
hard for foreign stores to open outlets in japan

a dispute over how fast japan will liberalize 
interest rates on deposits could make banking the next area of 
trade tensions in coming months a senior us official said 
tuesday 
after two days of talks with japanese officials on financial 
reforms us undersecretary of the treasury david c mulford said 
japans refusal to finish deregulating interest rates within one 
year was beginning to look more and more like a trade problem 
the deregulation process for interest rates is the key to all 
other liberalization and it is necessary for developing a money 
market policy mulford said 
he said that after seven years of stepbystep transition us 
officials would like the process of deregulation to be wrapped up 
within a year 
the talks led by mulford and his japanese counterpart vice 
minister of finance makoto utsumi were the eighth in a series of 
discussions on reforming the two countries financial markets 
separately the japanese government and ruling party on tuesday 
adopted a new economic policy guideline aimed at meeting other 
promises made in recent trade talks with the united states 
the new guideline calls for opening japans markets to more 
foreign goods making fiscal and budgetary policy changes to 
conform with other trading partners and increasing foreign aid 
on the interestrate front us officials charge that japanese 
financial firms take advantage of open markets overseas while 
receiving government protection from foreign competition at home 
while interest rates for money market certificates and largelot 
time deposits have been partially liberalized since 1984 when the 
bilateral talks began the ceilings on rates for demand deposits 
and smaller time deposits remain low time deposits account for 
about threequarters of total bank deposits here according to 
industry estimates 
utsumi said japanese officials agreed on the need to completely 
liberalize interest rates but disagreed on timing 
he bluntly disagreed with us charges that interest rate 
controls were being retained to give japanese banks a source of 
artificially cheap capital for loans and other investments 
enabling them to expand their presence overseas 
to avoid foreign exchange exposure loans overseas are made 
with funds in the same currency the loans are denominated in 
utsumi said 
utsumi declined to explain why japan would not specify a 
timetable for its plans and refused to comment on reports that 
interest rate ceilings would be lifted by 1993 
mulford said the failure to produce a timetable was likely to 
fuel protectionist moves in congress 
foreign banks share in total bank deposits in japan has risen 
only from 09 percent in 1983 to 104 percent in 1988 while their 
share of loans has fallen from 357 percent to 188 percent the 
bank of japan says 
japans share in the us lending market meanwhile has grown 
from 74 percent in 1983 to 14 percent in 1989 
the treasury department is required by law to report to congress 
by dec 1 on whether japan and other countries have given us 
banks and brokerages the same access they receive in american 
financial markets 
the fair trade and financial services act being considered in 
congress calls for retaliatory action against foreign financial 
firms in the united states if their own governments do not give 
us companies reciprocal treatment 
as of today it will not be possible for the us treasury to 
give a positive report on the japanese market mulford said 
analysts say the finance ministry faces strong opposition to 
interest rate deregulation from small and mediumsize banks already 
facing difficulties due to higher interest rates and limited 
liberalization 
japans central bank has raised its key rate for loans to 
commercial banks from 25 percent to 525 percent in the past year 
in turn commercial banks prime lending rates jumped from about 
55 percent to 72 percent 
finance ministry officials did promise to approve new foreign 
exchangerelated and securitized financial products and allow 
foreign securities firms to establish banking facilities to handle 
foreign exchange services mulford said 
the japanese also pledged to approve the use of the globex 
trading system by the end of june globex is a global electronic 
automated system for the trading of futures and futures options 
jointly operated by the chicago mercantile exchange and reuters 
holdings plc 
but we still see most of these improvements as only 
intermediate steps which fail to lead to complete financial market 
liberalization he said

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade although newcrop corn 
futures rose slightly amid persistent fears about raindelayed corn 
planting in the midwest 
wheat futures retreated modestly despite the agriculture 
departments announcement that china bought nearly 400000 metric 
tons of us wheat at subsidized prices and despite a usda offer 
to subsidize sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat to algeria 
joel karlin an analyst with research department inc in 
chicago said wheat traders fear the bush administration may not 
renew chinas favorable trade status which could result in fewer 
grain sales to china 
he said the wheat offer to algeria had little market impact 
because foreign buyers are likely to wait another month or two if 
they can for the cheaper prices that will accompany the us 
winter wheat harthe remedies disabled workers could seek from employers

the soviet union could become the hottest growth 
market of the 21st century but serious impediments remain for 
exporters and investors us officials told hundreds of american 
and soviet business leaders tuesday 
the leaders of the usussr trade and economic council 
spoke optimistically at their 13th annual meeting that political 
barriers to better business relations between the two nations 
finally were being swept away 
however us ambassador jack matlock said the kremlins 
economic embargo of lithuania will make it difficult to get the 
us congress to approve a bilateral commercial agreement 
the failing soviet economy and mikhail s gorbachevs plans to 
introduce desperately needed market reforms kept surfacing at the 
session 
we understand that political freedom must be accompanied by 
meat on the table said alaska gov steve cowper addressing the 
meeting on his states recent cooperation with the soviet union 
for perestroika to work the soviet economic system has to work 
thomas j duesterburg assistant secretary of commerce for 
international economic policy told the 500 american members and 
like number of soviets that gorbachev and other kremlin leaders 
have had the courage to face these facts and to begin a massive 
restructuring program in the soviet union to take it away from the 
policies that have brought it to the brink of economic ruin 
if democratization and a movement toward a market economy 
continues the ussr could certainly be the growth market of 
the 21st century he said 
but he said key obstacles remain the soviet ruble is not 
convertible and foreign enterprises have not been fully integrated 
into the economy 
the soviets still try to contain and control foreign investment 
as a compartmentalized part of the economy basic factors such as 
market information advertising the ability to hire and fire local 
staff and the ability to communicate with potential customers and 
partners are needed to overcome this obstacle duesterburg said 
of the more than 1400 jointventure agreements registered in 
the soviet union 140 involve us firms less than 15 percent of 
all foreign joint ventures are operational with most being small 
serviceoriented enterprises rather than manufacturing concerns 
the average capitalization of these is less than 2 million 
council chairman john j murphy the chairman president and 
chief executive officer of dresser industries inc was 
nevertheless upbeat about the soviet market 
he said the upcoming summit between gorbachev and us president 
george bush was a cause for optimism he also said he was confident 
of a waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment which for years has 
denied the soviets mostfavorednation status to punish them for 
preventing free emigration 
this will provide soviet manufacturers with the opportunity to 
test their competitors in the largest and toughest market in the 
world he said referring to the united states 
we also anticipate signing of the bilateral trade agreement 
providing the means for twoway trade to reach worldscale 
dimensions for the first time in a long time murphy added 
cochairman vladislav l malkevich head of the soviet chamber 
of commerce expressed the hope that political motives wont hurt 
ussoviet business relations 
i hope that a trade agreement will not become an instrument of 
any political gain like what happened in the past he said 
but matlock while saying that the political climate was 
improving could not ease malkevichs fears 
he mentioned the economic embargo imposed by gorbachev to punish 
lithuania for its independence moves and said that under those 
circumstances whatever we do in our negotiations its going to 
be probably very difficult and maybe impossible to persuade the 
american congress to let a commercial agreement go into effect 
also at the meeting a several new joint ventures were signed 
between us and soviet companies among them 
the american medical consortium consisting of pfizer 
international inc colgate palmolive inc hewlettpackard co 
hospital corp international medical service partners and federal 
express signed a contract to develop joint ventures its first 
will be a factory located in kazan to produce medical surgical 
and dental instruments and disposable syringes about 20 percent of 
its production is to be exported for hard currency 
raddisson hotels international and americom international corp 
signed an agreement with intourist and the committee for foreign 
tourism to build and operate the first american hotel and the first 
americanmanaged business center in moscow 
the cocacola co formally received the right to open a 
permanent representation office in moscow 
federal express announced the introduction of outbound air 
express service from moscow service from the united states and 
europe to moscow began in april

federal communications commission chairman alfred 
sikes told cable television executives tuesday that an era of 
increased competition is imminent in their industry 
the head of an industry association said however that he still 
believes washington will avoid drastic regulatory changes 
sikes told a meeting of the national cable television 
association that it should accept government action to open the 
marketplace the cable industry has been deregulated since 1984 
though both congress and the fcc currently are considering steps to 
reimpose some regulation 
you cannot expect government to continue sanctioning indeed 
protecting and promoting cable as a solesource provider of video 
services while at the same time foregoing the regulation that 
historically has been placed on monopoly operations sikes said 
the american people in short will not tolerate an 
unregulated monopoly indefinitely 
though cable tv has soared in popularity over the last decade 
it is now received in 571 percent of all us homes with 
television the industry has been beset recently by complaints 
from consumers about poor service and rising rates 
sikes said that during a visit last week to his home state of 
missouri he was besieged by questions from people who usually 
care little about fcc issues regarding cable tv 
the fcc is scheduled to take up cable issues at its july 26 
meeting 
ncta president james p mooney whose association is holding its 
annual convention this week in atlanta said following sikes 
speech that the fcc chairman shed little new light for him on the 
cable regulation issue 
mooney said he stood by his earlier assessment that he expects 
the fcc or congress this year to modify regulatory policies for 
cable but that the changes will not be drastic 
i think we can say today it looks highly likely that congress 
will support a moderate cable policy mooney told the ncta 
gathering monday 
sikes said he is going into the july 26 meeting supporting 
regulatory approaches which foster growth and diversity and as a 
result far less need for potentially debilitating government 
intervention 
if the cable industry resists opening the marketplace it could 
finditself in a utilitystyle regulatory environment that would 
inhibit entrepreneurs sikes said 
sikes also told the group he would support allowing cable to 
compete in other communications markets such as telephone and 
other carrierrelated services 
if video service markets were effectively competitive i can 
see few compelling public policy reasons for placing constraints on 
any of the participants including cable he said

it just provided for the smoothest transition possible 
eastern spokesman robin matell said of the agreement under which 
both airlines will fly to some latin countries not at the same 
time from june 30 until aug 14 
eastern and parent texas air corp dealt the latin american

chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
matell said the 349 million amount eastern would receive under 
the original agreement is down to 310 milliion

tampatoronto authorities

matell declined to elaborate on the status of the puerto rican 
routes

k mart corp shareholders seeking a greater 
role in the governance of the nations secondlargest retailer 
asked tuesday that management give them a chance to vote on the 
firms poison pill antitakeover defense 
a request that the k mart board submit the pill to a shareholder 
ballot was approved by a vote of 836 million shares to 641 
million at the companys annual meeting 
one of k marts biggest shareholders the state of wisconsin 
investment board said it does not necessarily oppose the defensive 
measure adopted by the k mart board of directors in may 1988 
but such moves have enough impact on shareholders interests 
that they should be submitted to a shareholder vote investment 
board spokeswoman betty kepley said at the meeting 
k marts bylaws do not require that the plan win shareholder 
approval the pill makes the cost of a hostile takeover 
prohibitively expensive by allowing the board to issue extra stock 
at a steep discount 
with their vote tuesday k mart shareholders joined stockholders 
in other companies who are seeking a greater voice in corporate 
governance institutional shareholders like the wisconsin 
investment board are among the leaders in the growing shareholder 
rights movement 
k mart chairman joseph e antonini said he would take the 
proposal before the board although he said the request was 
advisory and does not compel board action 
the retailer has not encountered any hostile takeover bids but 
adopted the measure because thats the way the wind was 
blowing antonini said at a news conference after the meeting 
at the meeting shareholders elected a slate of boardbacked 
directors including antonini they defeated two other stockholder 
proposals for confidentiality and thirdparty tabulation of 
shareholder votes and for the annual election of the entire board 
of directors 
antonini told shareholders k marts 64 percent increase in 
firstquarter income and 161 percent increase in sales were 
slightly above plan

countrys plans to reunite with east germany

weakness in the west german mark amid growing concern about the 
future of the reunification plan

from 15325 yen monday it traded lower at 15155 yen in london 
and 15125 yen in new york down from 15373 yen

a further weakening of the dollar would be acceptable although not 
necessarily a remedy to the us trade deficit

fresh declines in interest rates and a late 
buying surge helped the stock market extend its spring rally on 
tuesday propelling the dow jones industrial average to its fifth 
record high in seven sessions 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which climbed 2477 
points to an alltime high on monday gained 755 points to set 
another record at 285223 
chances for another advance were in some doubt at midday as 
profittaking eroded a strong early rally but buyers appeared in 
the last 30 minutes of trading to give the market a lift 
advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
816 up 689 down and 501 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 20335 million 
shares up from 16628 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 24236 million shares 
the market got an early lift from declining interest rates and a 
strong performance on stock markets in tokyo and london 
after the market opened the dow jones industrials surged nearly 
26 points higher in the first halfhour of trading before the rally 
stalled 
by noontime the dow jones industrial average was slightly below 
mondays closing level and it drifted in negative territory for 
most of the afternoon 
there was probably a little too much exuberance at the 
beginning said newton d zinder a market analyst for shearson 
lehman hutton 
bill raftery vice president for technical research at smith 
barney amp co added at midday this is perfectly normal 
profittaking 
the stock market has rolled up some impressive gains over the 
past three weeks in a rally that has been attributed mainly to 
declines in interest rates 
declining rates help stocks by making the potential rewards on 
stocks more appealing than yields on fixedincome investments 
lower rates also can improve the profit outlook for some companies 
by cutting their borrowing costs 
in the credit markets tuesday yields on 30year treasury bonds 
slipped toward 861 percent from 868 percent late monday 
nonetheless some market watchers expect a correction in the 
stock market that will drive prices lower 
but even small declines in stock prices appeared to draw out 
buying interest in the last 30 minutes of the session lifting the 
market higher 
it shows that even modest price discounts are being met by 
anxious buyers who have missed this threeweek old rally and short 
sellers said alfred e goldman director of technical market 
analysis at ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
shortsellers are traders who establish positions based on the 
presumption that prices will fall they are often drawn into the 
market as buyers when it becomes clear they have bet wrong and have 
to settle their accounts 
the most activelytraded issue on the nyse was nova corp of 
alberta canada which fell rsqb to 7 following a point gain in 
similarly active dealings on monday the company had said monday it 
was selling its rubber division 
computer associates international fell rsqb to 15 after reporting 
earnings results that disappointed some analysts 
among widelyheld stocks philip morris rose to 45 american 
telephone amp telegraph lost to 43lsqb and international business 
machines rose to 117 
federal express tumbled 5lsqb to 47 amid some apparent 
disappointment over april volume figures released late monday

percent in value 
the nyses composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 
030 to 19558

the senate on monday approved a 
constitutional change that will allow the return of private 
commercial banking the government news agency notimex said 
the reform repeals the 1982 nationalization of the banking 
system it eliminates a paragraph in the constitution that reserved 
ownership of banking and credit services for the government 
proposed may 2 by president carlos salinas de gortari and passed 
earlier by the chamber of deputies the legislation will be sent to 
the countrys 31 states approval by 16 of the state legislatures 
is required 
the reform passed the senate on a 522 vote 
in the 90minute debate two senators from the leftist 
democratic revolutionary party opposed the bill arguing that it 
runs counter to national interests and will concentrate economic 
power in the hands of a few 
sen alfonso martinez dominguez of the ruling institutional 
revolutionary party which holds all but four of the 64 senate 
seats responded that the reforms are in response to world changes 
under the change up to 100 percent private ownership will be 
allowed in the 18 commercial banks affected but salinas has said 
the government would retain stock in some commercial banks the 
government also will keep numerous banks and other institutions 
that provide farm and development loans and other specialized 
services 
when thenpresident jose lopez portillo nationalized the banking 
system in september 1982 as he neared the end of his term he 
claimed the banks were helping mexicans send money out of the 
country sinking the economy deeper into recession 
in proposing the return to private banking salinas said the 
country has made sweeping changes in development policies and 
economic structure to emerge from the economic crisis 
since salinas took office in december 1988 hundreds of 
stateowned businesses and industries have been closed or put up 
for sale to private interests the countrys onceheavily protected 
domestic markets have been opened up to foreign competition and 
doors have been reopened to foreign investment 
also on monday a senate report recommended mexico negotiate a 
free trade agreement with the united states its largest trading 
partner give high priority to trade with the pacific basic 
countries and review agreements with japan to include new forms of

kidder peabody amp co has announced it would 
resume for its own accounts a form of program trading blamed for 
worsening stock market volatility a newspaper reported 
kidder said it believed it can avoid disrupting the market with 
safeguards it is adopting the new york times said in an early 
edition of tuesdays newspaper 
kidder and other wall street brokerages stopped employing a type 
of program trading known as index arbitrage after the stock market 
plunged last october the strategy seeks to profit from small 
differences in prices between the stock and futures markets by 
simultaneously buying and selling big baskets of stocks and stock 
index futures 
kidder a subsidiary of general electric co said it wouldnt 
use the strategy during times of high volatility 
it also said it would require that stock sales would be made as 
part of program trades only if the last trade on the new york stock 
exchange took place at a higher price than the previous one and 
purchases would be made only if the last big board trade was done 
at a lower price than previously 
whatever we do will be done more slowly and we will surely do 
less than we would have done without the restrictions thomas f 
ryan executive managing director of kidder was quoted as saying 
although other brokerages have continued to conduct program 
trades for clients the only wall street firm to do so for its own 
accounts has been bear stearns amp co

president bushs son neil voted as a board 
member of a colorado thrift to approve 106 million in loans to a 
business associate who defaulted on the entire amount a federal 
regulator said tuesday 
stephen hershkowitz deputy director of enforcement for the 
office of thrift supervision revealed the amount of the loss after 
a house banking committee member pressed him to testify on neil 
bushs role in the collapse of silverado banking savings and loan 
association of denver 
bush 34 was to testify wednesday before the panel examining 
the 1 billion collapse of the thrift in december 1988 he was a 
director of silverado from 1985 to august 1988 resigning two weeks 
after his father received the republican presidential nomination 
bushs attorney james nesland did not return a telephone call 
tuesday seeking comment on hershkowitzs testimony 
hershkowitz and other regulators testified tuesday that 
silverado made inflated loans to developers who had to reinvest 
part of the money in the thrift 
thrift regulators told the committee that under the quid pro 
quo lending program at silverado developers received loans to 
buy buildings at inflated values set by outside appraisers 
the properties values were inflated by 270 million to 300 
million over market value they said 
in exchange developers were required to use part of the loan 
money to buy preferred stock in silverados holding company to 
purchase an interest in a loan pool set up by the thrift 
the pool which contained both good and bad loans totaled 
around 1 billion or roughly 60 percent of silverados total loan 
portfolio developers who bought shares in the loan pool received 
interest generated by the performing loans in the pool 
examiners said monday they believed this arrangement set up in 
august 1986 was unique in the sampl industry 
the panel of regulators told the banking committee that 
silverados board of directors was a rubber stamp for 
management they also said insider abuse occurred at the thrift 
neil bush had oil and gas business deals with two of silverados 
major borrowers developers kenneth good and bill walters 
regulators have alleged that loans by silverado to the two men were 
a conflict of interest for bush who failed to disclose the 
relationship to the board 
hershkowitz said bush voted to approve loans to walters but did 
not vote on loans to good 
rep frank annunzio dill pressed hershkowitz on the loans 
after the regulator testified that bushs role was no different 
than other outside directors in the collapse except that he 
voted on the walter loans without the disclosure 
bush had information that would be relevant to other board 
members and did not disclose it said hershkowitz 
hershkowitz said the loans to walters totaled 106 million 
were any in default asked annunzio 
all of them hershkowitz said 
hershkowitz said he didnt know how much of the money had been 
recovered and that another agency the federal deposit insurance 
corp would have to sue to recover any losses 
the collapse of silverado now operating as part of columbia 
savings the largest thrift in colorado is expected to cost us 
taxpayers as much as 1 billion total losses from the nationwide 
savings and loan crisis which has forced the government to take 
over more than 400 failed institutions are estimated at around 
250 billion 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the banking 
committee said he would ask the panel to subpoena kermit mowbray 
a former president of the federal home loan bank of topeka kan 
mowbray had been scheduled to testify at tuesdays hearing but did 
not appear 
the committee also plans to issue subpoenas to other requested 
witnesses who failed to show up said a committee spokesman who 
spoke on condition of anonymity they are good walters thomas 
thompson former district director of ots topeka office larry 
mizel chief executive of mdc holdings and john r sullivan chief

citicorps credit rating was lowered tuesday by 
another major debtrating service which based its decision on 
concerns about the quality of real estate and takeover loans at the 
nations largest bank 
moodys investors service inc said it downgraded a total of 
374 billion in debt of citicorp some of its subsidiaries and 
debt that it guarantees the announcement came nearly one month 
after rival standard amp poors corp took similar action 
both credit rating firms said they were largely concerned about 
the effects of escalating problem real estate loans particularly 
in commerical developments given what they called citicorps weak 
earnings position and low capital levels 
they also cited worries about citicorps large third world debt 
portfolio and loans to finance takeovers 
lower credit ratings for citicorp is regarded as general sign of 
weakness in the banking sector and makes it more expensive for the 
bank to borrow money 
last month citicorp reported a 56 percent drop in firstquarter 
earnings mainly because of domestic real estate loan difficulties 
in slumping regions that are expected to worsen this year 
although citicorps real estate portfolio is geographically 
diverse and its underwriting standards appear to be sound moodys 
believes that citicorp is vulnerable to the deteriorating national 
real estate market moodys said in a statement 
a number of major banking institutions have seen their debt 
ratings lowered recently by moodys and sampp because of similar 
problems 
citicorp said it was disappointed by moodys action but added 
that it didnt expect the downgradings to significantly increase 
overall funding costs 
in a statement citicorp said it was confident the strength of 
its core businesses and wellpositioned global franchises will 
continue to provide excellent returns and growth 
although citicorps credit remains investmentgrade quality a 
lower rating heightens a banks borrowing costs by prompting 
investors to demand higher interest to compensate for increased 
risk the ratings have no effect on customer deposits 
the downgradings by moodys included citicorps senior debt to 
singleathree from singleaone commercial paper to primetwo 
from primeone and citibanks senior debt to singleaone from 
doubleatwo 
in additon it said it lowered about 62 billion in structured 
debt guaranteed by citicorp and citibank letters of credit

pinnacle west capital corp directors on tuesday 
rejected a 182 billion cash offer from pacificorp saying the 
northwest utility giant didnt offer enough for the parent of 
arizona public service co 
it was the fourth time pinnacle west directors have rejected a 
pacificorp bid for the holding company itself or for its utility 
subsidiary 
pinacle west chairman richard snell said the board also turned 
down a 500 million offer by the salt river project utility to buy 
part of arizona public services service territory in the phoenix 
area 
snell said salt river projects offer made friday was too low 
based on the annual revenues from the 166000 customers involved 
arizona public service is the flagship subsidiary of 
phoenixbased pinnacle west and has been its only profitable 
operation for two years 
pacificorp based in portland ore said last week its fourth 
offer was its last but in a statement after the rejection verl r 
topham pacificorps executive vice president said the company may 
now make an offer to pinnacle wests shareholders 
shareholders of pinnacle west have been told by their 
management not to expect dividends for at least the next three 
years topham said we believe shareholders see the 
significant value of our offer and support the merger proposal 
pacificorp which owns pacific power amp light and utah power amp 
light has begun an advertising campaign here to solicit support 
from shareholders and arizona public service ratepayers 
pinnacle wests annual meeting takes place here wednesday it 
was expected to be raucous even before the takeover rejection 
after posting a 676 million loss from discontinued operations by 
its former merabank subsidiary pinnacle west reported a 5514 
million net loss in 1989 its common stock dividend was eliminated 
in october 
snell said pacificorps 21pershare offer 825 higher than 
the stock price at the time did not reflect the value of this 
company 
pinnacle west shares fell 12 cents to close at 1587 tuesday 
in new york stock exchange trading pacificorp shares fell 25 cents 
to close at 2175 
more importantly this is not the time for us to sell this 
company snell added 
he said it would take two to three years to win regulatory 
approval for the oregon company to acquire pinnacle west which 
also owns the suncor development el dorado investment and malapai 
resources companies 
shareholders would not receive their money until approval was 
won snell said and by then pinnacle wests business strategies 
will have significantly increased both equity and the intrinsic 
value of the company 
snell said an attempt by pacificorp to take over pinnacle west 
through stockholder proxies would lead to a long fight he said his 
companys outlook has grown increasingly more positive 
he said pinnacle west was close to selling malapai resources 
recently closed the sale of the wigwam resort and anticipated a 
turnaround in the arizona economy 
but the major factors supporting a rosier outlook are the 
resolution of its illfated ownership of merabank which lost more 
than 400 million in two years before the government took it over 
jan 31 and the prospect of better operations at the palo verde 
nuclear generating plant snell said 
malfunctions have kept most of the 93 billion threereactor 
power complex out of operation since march 1989

proponents of a federal law that might make it 
more difficult for victims of defective products to collect damages 
overcame a major obstacle tuesday when a key committee voted to 
approve the proposal 
sen ernest hollings dsc chairman of the commerce science 
and transportation committee and consumer subcommittee chairman 
sen richard bryan dnev both opposed the bill but backers 
picked up support from other democrats in the 137 vote 
this is what we never had before this is what is new said 
victor schwartz an attorney for business and industry supporters 
of the legislation who said the support from sen lloyd bentsen 
was especially important 
this is very bipartisan now he said 
congress has tried to develop a federal product liability law 
since the 1970s and president bush made it an administration 
legislative priority in his state of the union address 
the bill would create a uniform standard for imposing punitive 
damages in product liability lawsuits and establish a twoyear 
statute of limitations for most product liability claims claims by 
workers injured by durable goods such as factory machinery would 
have a 25year statute of limitations 
the measure would allow separate trials or settlements of 
punitive damages and compensatory damages and allow companies to 
pay some noneconomic damages in proportion to their responsibility 
for harm 
it would also exempt from punitive damage lawsuits products 
approved by the food and drug administration and the federal 
aviation administration 
opponents say the bill would needlessly preempt state law and 
would limit the ability to collect for deaths and injuries that 
result from industry negligence or irresponsibility 
backers of the legislation argue that variations in liability 
laws from state to state offer potentially limitless damages and 
hinder product development and american competitiveness 
the bill will not go immediately go to the senate because it has 
been referred to the judiciary committee proponents say the bills 
prospects there are uncertain however there is a companion bill 
hr2700 in the house 
schwartz said some opponents may attempt a filibuster if the 
bill reaches the senate floor for debate 
besides bentsen dtexas democratic senators voting to report 
the bill favorably out of committee were daniel inouye of hawaii 
nebraskas james exon jay rockefeller of west virginia and charles

a canadian investor family said tuesday it 
will continue to pursue its interests in armstrong world industries 
inc despite setbacks at last months company meeting 
the investment company owned by the belzbergs filed notice with 
the securities and exchange commission this week that it bought an 
additional 10000 shares of armstrong stock on may 15 
the belzbergs now own 1169 percent of armstrongs 4715 million 
shares said family spokesman ned scharff 
its really a small increment he said but it shows they 
are buying 
the sec filing did not describe the familys intentions for the 
company scharff said 
in this latest filing they say they might buy they might 
sell push for a merger find a partner he said they just 
listed about anything possible 
armstrong spokesman john scheldrup said this filing isnt 
anything new everything they said today theyve said before 
the belzbergs and armstrong have been waging a bitter 
protracted proxy fight in fullpage newspaper ads and in the courts 
the family wanted revisions in the companys articles of 
incorporation to be placed before the shareholders at the annual 
meeting april 30 the floor covering company refused charging that 
the changes apparently were intended to smooth the way for a 
takeover by eroding the board of directors authority 
the belzbergs were not able to gain a court order in time to 
force the revisions to be placed before the shareholders the 
matter is still in litigation 
the belzbergs gained just one seat on the 13member board at the 
april 30 meeting 
the proxy fight prompted pennsylvania to enact the nations 
toughest antitakeover law in april the measure would garnish 
corporate raiders shortterm profits on takeover attempts 
constrict their voting rights and preserving labor contracts if 
ownership changes hands

chrysler corp is dropping a plan to sell its 
remaining defense and aviation electronics business because it 
didnt receive high enough bids company officials said tuesday 
the nations thirdlargest automaker put chrysler technologies 
corp on the block in december and sold its largest operation 
corporate jet manufacturer gulfstream aerospace corp in february 
for 825 million 
chrysler had said it also sought buyers for the remaining 
chrysler technologies units as part of a move to concentrate on 
making cars and trucks 
those units are electrospace systems inc a maker of defense 
and electronics products and systems bought in 1987 for 367 
million and airborne systems inc formed in january 1989 by 
combining military aviation operations of gulfstream and 
electrospace 
the company received inquiries but the values didnt 
approximate what we felt these companies were worth to the 
shareholders chrysler technologies spokesman john stellman said 
chrysler had stated that if it couldnt get a good price it 
wouldnt sell said analyst ron glantz of dean witter reynolds in 
san francisco 
although changes in world politics may have created 
uncertainties about defense spending for tactical weapons chrysler 
technologies chairman paul e wright said the company had a 12 
percent increase in orders in 1989 for the electronics 
surveillance and intelligenceoriented equipment in which it 
specializes 
chrysler technologies employs about 3500 people in texas

unions at united airlines are negotiating to hire 
a second investment banker to help secure financing for their 
planned buyout of parent company ual corp a union representative 
said tuesday 
united employee acquisition corp wants to hire goldman sachs amp 
co to supplement work being done by salomon inc one of the 
advisers to the pilots union 
the union groups contract to buy ual will lapse if financing 
for the 438 billion deal is not obtained by aug 10 if the group 
obtains financing it would have until the end of the year to close 
the deal 
this is a very large deal and theres a desire to get as much 
firepower as we can possibly muster said steven matthews a 
spokesman for the union group 
it would be unusual for a deal of this size and complexity to 
go forward with only one investment bank matthews said in a 
telephone interview 
the group includes the air line pilots association the 
international association of machinists the association of flight 
attendants and noncontract workers 
under the deal approved april 6 by uals board uniteds pilots 
would own 379 percent of the companys stock machinists would own 
357 percent noncontract employees would get 143 percent and 
flight attendants 12 percent 
the union group has proposed overall employee wage and benefit 
cuts totaling 2 billion over five years to offset buyout costs 
investor skepticism about the ability of the union group to 
borrow the 4 billion needed to complete the buyout has contributed 
to a steady slide in uals stock price from 16350 the day the 
deal was signed to as low as 15037 the stock fell 225 tuesday 
to close at 15150 on the new york stock exchange 
skepticism has been fueled in part by the union groups 
inability to find a new chief executive officer to replace ual 
chairman stephen m wolf 
matthews refused to comment on the search for a ceo but said he 
is confident financing will be secured

eight investment funds spawned by troubled vms 
realty partners said tuesday they returned to profitablity in the 
first quarter after reporting net losses last year because of their 
former parents problems 
the funds also said they may try to take possession of some vms 
properties 
the five realestate investment trusts and three publicly traded 
trusts made no additions to their loanloss reserves in the first 
quarter they said in separate statements 
but each of the funds reported a decline in earnings compared 
with the first quarter of 1989 mainly because of provisions made 
to cover the possibility that they will be unable to collect 
accrued and unpaid interest from vms 
the funds have severed their ties to chicagobased vms a 
limited partnership syndicator that disclosed a severe liquidity 
crisis last year 
the funds had raised 11 billion from the public and lent it to 
vms to invest in realestate development 
in february vms stopped making loan payments to the funds and 
four vms officers resigned 
vmss troubles resulted partly from the softening real estate 
market and from changes in the federal tax law in 1986 that made 
real estate investments less attractive xerox corp holds a 25 
percent interest in vms 
the eight funds said they were exploring the possibility of 
taking possession through various means including foreclosure of 
properties vms put up as collateral 
they said they have retained four firms dean witter reynolds 
inc cushman amp wakefield inc draper amp kramer and grubb amp ellis 
to provide real estate and financial advice 
representation by these wellregarded companies demonstrates 
faith in our efforts to enhance the value of the funds said 
leonard g levine president of all eight funds and a former vms 
vice president 
vms had no immediate comment on the funds statement said kathy 
zajicek secretary to vms executive vice president scott lager 
the funds are vms mortgage investment fund vms mortgage 
investors limited partnership vms mortgage investors lp ii vms 
mortgage investors lp iii vms short term income trust vms hotel

two soviet officials predicted 
their nations energy exports to western and eastern europe would 
drop in the next few years because soviet oil natural gas and coal 
are becoming too expensive to produce 
petroleum and gas exports could drop to as little as one third 
of their 1988 levels according to alexander a arbatov a member 
of the committee for natural resources of the soviet academy of 
sciences and foreign ministry official eugene m khartukov 
in that year the soviet union exported the energy equivalent of 
447 million tons of coal the two officials said in a joint written 
presentation at the seventh petroleum and gas conference here 
energy exports have ceased bringing in golden eggs for 
the soviet economy the paper said 
the soviets have earned a significant amount of hard currency by 
exporting energy to western europe particularly west germany 
italy and austria eastern europe relies almost exclusively on the 
soviets for energy imports 
the paper gave no specific reason for the rising cost of energy 
production 
western experts however have said that moscow has failed to 
invest in modern equipment and is being forced to drill for oil and 
gas on remote siberian locations as more easily accessible sources 
become depleted 
in 1981 the soviet union made 71 times as much from the sale 
of a barrel of crude petroleum as it cost to produce the oil the 
two officials paper said 
by next year that ratio will have fallen to 18 the paper 
said adding similar declines in profitability were expected for 
natural gas and coal

with smoke loud music and mtvstyle videos 
microsoft corp tuesday formally introduced its new version of 
windows a software product designed to make ibm personal computers 
and their clones as easy to use as macintosh computers 
bill gates microsofts 34yearold chairman told hundreds of 
financial analysts journalists and others at a new york theater 
that windows is a major milestone in the history of the pc 
industry 
many analysts agree they say windows could provide the 
strongest challenge yet to apple computer incs popular macintosh 
by grafting its userfriendly operations onto international 
business machines corp personal computers and compatible models 
machines that are notorious for their arcane commands 
gates told the standingroomonly crowd and by satellite 
hookup audiences in six other cities nationwide that his 
redmond washbased software company will spend 10 million 
promoting windows over the next six months he called that a record 
for the software industry 
microsoft plans to mail 400000 demonstration copies of the 149 
software to personal computer users gates told the audience after 
a soundandlight show that mixed hype humor and product 
demonstrations 
more than 30 personal computer companies have said they will 
include windows with their machines and dozens of software 
companies are making applications programs compatible with the new 
version of windows 
windows could provide a major boost to microsoft which already 
dominates the personal computer software industry shearson lehman 
hutton inc projects windows and related products will reap nearly 
500 million in revenues for microsoft in the fiscal year that 
starts july 1 
i think its the most significant announcement since the 
introduction of dos said rick sherlund an analyst at goldman 
sachs amp co referring to the operating system for ibm personal 
computers developed by microsoft 
this delivers a lot of the capabilities that normally have 
been associated with the mac to the pc he said referring to ibm 
machines and their knockoffs 
the loser of course could be apple a windowsequipped ibm 
clone could sell for as little as half the price of a macintosh 
apples stock dropped a total of 2 a share friday and monday 
after adjusting for a dividend but rose 187 a share tuesday to 
close at 4137 in national overthecounter trading 
microsoft shares jumped 125 tuesday to close at 7150 in 
overthecounter trading after rising a total of 550 friday and 
monday in anticipation of the announcement 
apple based in cupertino calif is expected to announce a 
lowerpriced macintosh later this year and is working on a more 
powerful version of its operating system 
most computer experts also say the macintosh retains some 
advantages over a windowsequipped ibm machine expecially for 
intensive graphicsbased uses 
microsoft for its part says it will not target macintosh users 
or potential users instead pitching windows to users of ibm 
machines and compatible models 
that strategy is due in part to the fact that 85 percent of the 
computer market is composed of ibm machines or clones compared 
with the macintoshs 7 percent share 
windows works on computers using intel corps 80286 80386 or 
80486 microprocessors that encompasses about 20 million computers 
in use out of about 50 million that use the dos operating system 
microsoft says 
this is microsofts third version of windows the first version 
introduced in 1985 and a later enhancement both failed to impress 
computer experts 
windows is product known as a graphical user interface it 
shields computer users from complex typed commands by replacing 
them with onscreen pictures called icons and a handheld control 
device called a mouse 
windows also expands a computers useable memory capacity and 
allows users to keep several applications programs active at once 
by running them in sections of the screen called windows

fbi agents on tuesday searched two northrop 
corp plants where fuselage parts are built for the navys fa18 
fighterbomber 
neither northrop nor the fbi would comment on the purpose of the 
raids the government sued the company last month alleging 
fraudulent billing on the fa18 program 
the raids were the latest in a series of criminal and civil 
actions that have plagued the aerospace company over the past few 
years 
northrop spokesman ron owens confirmed the searches of plants in 
suburban hawthorne and el segundo 
we are working with them in their search and that is all that 
i can comment upon owens said 
fbi special agent fred reagan said he could not comment on the 
raids although he admitted everyone seems to know about them 
mcdonnell douglas is the prime contractor for the carrierbased 
fa18 northrop assembles the center and aft sections of the plane 
as a subcontractor under what is known as a solesource 
fixedprice agreement 
that means only one contractor is considered qualified to do the 
work and it is not subject to competitive bidding 
in april the justice department sued northrop claiming the 
company had fraudulently fattened bills submitted to the navy for 
work on the fa18 
damages were estimated at 25 million by an attorney familiar 
with the case and the recovery could be treble because the suit 
was originally filed by a former northrop employee under the 
federal false claims act 
the justice department intervened in the case and took over the 
litigation after apparently deciding not to file criminal charges 
as part of a deal with northrop last february 
under that deal northrop pleaded guilty to 34 criminal fraud 
counts and agreed to pay a 17 million fine for alleged 
falsification of tests on a stabilization control for the marine 
av8b harrier jet fighter and for the mx missile guidance mechanism 
the justice department lawsuit claimed northrop failed to 
disclose savings it made from a new manufacturing method for the 
fa18 parts 
the parts are made from composite materials and formed in a 
process that requires high pressure heat and vacuum 
the original suit was filed in 1987 by former northrop contract 
and pricing division manager eldon l janssen who claimed he 
learned of the alleged deceitful pricing in the course of his 
duties 
despite the february pleabargain agreement northrop remains 
open to several investigations and lawsuits the justice department 
sued northrop for 5 million over the av8b tests despite the 
criminal pleading 
among northrops other legal problems 
allegations of 20 billion in overcharges on the b2 bomber 
fbi agents in february raided northrops b2 parts plant in pico 
rivera 
grand juries in los angeles and honolulu are looking at whether 
northrop made political payoffs to south korea 
a texas grand jury is looking into allegations that northrop 
cheated the government on a program auctioning property seized by 
the us customs service 
former northrop employees are engaged in a whistleblower 
lawsuit that mirrors the government charges on the mx missile 
guidance system their attorney said he is seeking between 20 
million and 30 million in damages

delegates to a united auto workers 
bargaining strategy convention tuesday killed an effort that would 
have required bargainers to seek costofliving protection for the 
unions 446000 retirees 
by knocking down a procedural move to have the convention 
consider a resolution from a flint mich local delegates 
supported uaw president owen biebers plea to keep negotiating 
committees unfettered 
after winning the vote bieber engineered a quick end to the 
convention which originally was scheduled to conclude wednesday 
with delegates adopting dozens of resolutions directing negotiators 
this summer 
at a news conference later bieber said the union would seek 
inflation protection for its 446000 retirees 
well have the whole six miles out there he said meaning 
all options to protect the income of pensioners will be considered 
the uaw isnt required to bargain for retirees but in the past 
the union has negotiated lumpsum payments for retirees to counter 
inflation 
a cola for retirees proposal could be extremely costly for the 
big three automakers the companies and the union have said the 
union estimates that such a provision could cost more than 1 
billion a year for the big three 
contract talks open in july with each of the big three 
automakers and uaw executives alike have warned that the cost of 
a sliding inflation protection instead of a lumpsum payment could 
result in reductions in other benefits 
despite that the cola for retirees issue has been gaining steam 
in recent months 
on tuesday after about an hours debate a move by delegate 
alex wassell to bring a resolution from flint calling for cola for 
retirees to the convention floor failed overwhelmingly in a 
showofhands vote 
during the debate bieber repeatedly told delegates that 
although a separate resolution doesnt include specific references 
to cola negotiators would bring the matter to bargaining tables at 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp 
i do not believe that there is one single person in this 
convention hall and certainly your president who reads that 
language to preclude our attempting to get cola bieber said 
that wasnt good enough for wassell of local 1776 at gms willow 
run mich assembly plant 
i was trying to shoehorn bieber into getting the language 
he said im not satisfied because bieber may indeed not make 
that a top priority 
in his opening address on monday bieber listed five major 
bargaining goals job security pension improvements higher 
wages protection of healthcare benefits and responsible 
management by the automakers 
there was little debate during the first two days of the 
convention with the exception of retirees inflation protection 
brother bieber said it does not preclude fighting for cola on 
pensions i believe thats not half strong enough said mike 
nuckolls of local 1999 in oklahoma city 
there is one issue we cant let them wimp out on he said 
we need cola for pensions 
also tuesday uaw members voted overwhelmingly to combine three 
of the unions 15 us regions into two the merger would occur 
only when one of the three regional directors leaves office for any 
reason 
the three regions 2 2a and 2b in ohio west virginia and 
parts of pennsylvania have just under 113000 members the 
consolidation reflects the shrinking size of the union which has 
dropped from a high of about 15 million members in the 1970s to 
about 1 million now

repay in full the brewerys debt of 608 million by the end of

occidental petroleum corp chairman 
armand hammer told skeptical shareholders tuesday it was a 
legitimate corporate expense for occidental to spend 98 million to 
set up a museum for his art collection 
hammer 92 joking that his new heart pacemaker is guaranteed 
for eight years said the museum will breed goodwill as displaying 
his collection around the world has done 
that will help business ultimately boosting profits and the 
stock price he said at occidentals annual meeting at the santa 
monica civic auditorium 
the armand hammer museum and cultural center is under 
construction beside the companys headquarters building in los 
angeles and is scheduled to open in november 
three groups of shareholders sued after learning that occidental 
was funding the museum plans call for the company to donate 60 
million to build the armand hammer museum of art and cultural 
center and 38 million to endow it 
that doesnt sit well with shareholders such as geneva fulton 
who stepped to the microphone and told the board of directors i 
dont believe as a stockholder that we should have to pay for dr 
hammers museum 
hammer replied that his art collection was appraised recently at 
400 million and included a van gogh painting hospital at st 
remy that he estimated might be worth more than 100 million at 
auction 
i am surrendering this without any reward to myself or 
compensation he said 
for one reason you cant take it with you he said to 
laughter the second reason is i think its good for occidental 
and for you as shareholders 
hammer decided to build the museum after reneging on a promise 
to donate his collection to the los angeles county museum of art 
he backed out of that deal after the museum refused some of his 
demands including taking the names of other donors off the 
building 
not all shareholders were critical of the museum plan and hammer 
hes an older man let him live in peace and contentment 
and the shareholders should mind their own business a 
grayhaired woman said at the end of a rambling speech of praise 
i love you dear and you should live forever 
hammer noting that hed heard recently of a 90yearold woman 
marrying a 93yearold man replied send me your name and 
telephone number he met briefly with her after the meeting
