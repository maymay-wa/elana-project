president corazon aquino on wednesday 
ordered a limited truce with communist rebels in metropolitan 
manila and areas leveled by a deadly july earthquake 
mrs aquino said the decision was taken in reaction to 
widespread calls for a peace in this violencewracked island nation 
in response to the peoples call for a genuine peace i have 
directed the armed forces of the philippines to maintain the 
suspension of offensive military operations in the 
earthquakeaffected areas and the national capital region district 
command she said in a statement 
justice secretary franklin drilon a member of the cabinet 
security committee said the truce would apply in the manila area 
and the provinces of benguet mountain and nueva vizcaya which 
were badly damaged by the july 16 quake the quake killed hundreds 
of people 
the statement avoided the word ceasefire deputy press 
secretary horacio paredes said the military was allergic to the 
word ceasefire 
mrs aquino gave no timetable for the truce there was no 
immediate reaction from the underground communist party of the 
philippines which has been waging a 21year insurgency 
last week the rebel national democratic front said a ceasefire 
would be ineffectual unless the government offered an agenda to 
solve the nations problems including poverty reppression and 
the continued presence of us military bases here 
the military has objected to ceasefires because it feels 
the term gives an unacceptable status to the rebel new peoples 
army the military believes a 60day nationwide ceasefire declared 
in december 1986 enabled the rebels to regroup and retrain 
earlier tuesday supporters of ferdinand marcos marched through 
manila to mark the late presidents birthday president aquino 
again refused to allow marcos to be buried in the philippines 
marcos widow imelda appealed to mrs aquino on monday to 
allow her to bring home the remains of her husband from hawaii 
marcos died there last sept 28 
the return of marcos has to await a more propitious time 
mrs aquino said in a statement read by press secretary tomas 
gomez prudence dictates that additional occasions for 
debilitating and distracting activities be avoided 
mrs aquino has refused to allow the marcoses to return citing 
security concerns marcos was ousted from the presidency in 
february 1986 and driven into exile by a civilianbacked military 
uprising 
after a roman catholic mass for marcos house of representatives 
minority leader rodolfo albano read a statement praising the former 
philippine leader albano said marcos was a good man judged at a 
wrong time by the wrong minds apparently referring to mrs 
aquinos government 
everyone has human faults for who has none the statement 
said it is said that when a man is gone only his misdeeds are 
often remembered no matter how few forgetting all his good 
deeds 
the statement also appeared as a fullpage advertisement in 
several manila newspapers 
among those who attended the mass were some former members of 
marcos cabinet several congressmen and retired generals 
about 1000 people marched through manila to mark marcos 73rd 
birthday tuesday 
mrs aquino said she would make no deals with mrs marcos 
regarding the expresidents burial until the former first lady 
returns money allegedly taken from the philippines the aquino 
government has accused the marcoses of plundering up to 10 billion 
during 20 years in power

president bush won resounding bipartisan 
praise tuesday for a speech explaning his persian gulf policy as a 
leading democrat warned iraqs leader that if he starts a war we 
will finish it 
but democrats showed less enthusiasm for portions of the 
presidents address to lawmakers that emphasized the inability of 
congressional budget negotiators to reach a deal on the deficit 
moments after bush assured congress that iraqs aggression 
against kuwait would fail house majority leader dick gephardt 
dmo responded in the official democratic reaction the 
president has asked for our support he has it 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said if there 
are any fencesitters on the presidents decisons in the middle 
east this speech ought to push them off the fence 
dole said bush reminded lawmakers that iraqi leader saddam 
hussein has sounded the wakeup call on the defense front its a 
little premature to be spending a peace dividend when were 
deploying 140000 troops on the sands of saudi arabia 
sen edward m kennedy dmass a frequent bush critic was 
just as effusive on the persian gulf policy saying congress has 
real respect for what has been achieved by the president in 
marshalling the international community 
but kennedy was among democrats expressing some discord over 
bushs comments that most americans are sick and tired of endless 
battles in the congress and between the branches over budget 
matters 
the use by the administration of this crisis in order to 
enhance the defense budget kennedy said will not be tolerated 
or accepted 
rep charles schumer dny said democrats are quite 
angry about bushs remarks on the budget and added if the 
president and the republicans think that because of the persian 
gulf they are riding high and can get their way on a budget 
agreement thats not going to happen this speech didnt help on 
the budget 
bush was called a courageous leader by sen richard lugar 
rind and sen warren rudman rnh said the president gave a 
very tough steely speech he just drew the line its important 
that the american people continually be reinformed and reinforced 
as to what the stakes are here 
rep larry smith dfla a frequent critic of republican 
policies backed the presidents prediction that saddam husseins 
aggression would fail saying he hopes saddam gets the message 
and begins to act on it 
but he said bush could have could have acted more quickly in 
trying to get american civilians out of kuwait and iraq before they 
became hostages 
that remark did not sit well with house republican whip newt 
gingrich of georgia who countered i dont know of any 
practical method by which we could have intervened once the 
invasion took place 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said 
bush broke little new ground but essentially laid out in one 
document a very comprehensive argument for our position in the 
gulf 
gephardt contrasted his partys backing for the administration 
with criticism of germany and japan for not doing enough to support 
operation desert shield 
while concentrating on the united states response to iraqs 
invasion of kuwait gephardt also stumped for the democratic 
position in crucial budget talks reminded americans of bushs new 
willingness to raise taxes and called for cuts in expensive 
defense programs 
and he indirectly criticized bush and his predecessor ronald 
reagan for the lack of an energy policy during the past decade 
gephardt said the united states was in the persian gulf not 
simply for oil or to save emirs and kings but to defend the most 
fundamental values of a more stable and decent world 
firmly clearly and unequivocally wemust say to iraqi 
president saddam hussein let our people go let kuwait go and if 
you start a war know that we will finish it 
declaring that the nations vital interests are at stake 
gephardt said we cannot and will not permit the invading forces 
of a fanatical regime to control half of all the oil reserves which 
are the lifeblood of the world economy 
criticizing german and japanese contributions so far for 
operation desert shield gephardt noted that those countries along 
with members of nato depend far more heavily on mideast oil than 
we do 
when countries like egypt can stand beside us when young 
americans stand on front lines only miles from the threat of 
poison gas the least the japanese and germans can do is support us 
and not just with words they must respond to our potential 
sacrifice of lives with at least a financial sacrifice of their 
own 
referring to closed door budget talks underway at andrews air 
force base gephardt said democrats offered cuts in domestic 
programs but will never abandon the cause of working families 
he contended bush has given a commitment to raise taxes and 
said the higher tax burden must be borne by wealthy americans 
without specifically mentioning the republican administrations 
of bush and ronald reagan gephardt criticized the nations 
freemarket energy policies of the past decade he said the nation 
must not be permanently faced with a choice between standing up 
against aggression or standing still in gas lines 
he also pushed hard for proposed democratic cuts in the defense 
budget saying the planned star wars antimissile system the 
radarevading b2 bomber and the mx missile are costly systems 
designed for a cold war that we have already won

donald janke has worked for 40 years in savings 
and loans taking in governmentguaranteed deposits and lending 
them to homeowners as mortgages 
his marquette savings and loan and the midwest as a region still 
make a profit with these nonglamorous transactions wisconsins 
sampl trade group even ran a series of ads last year saying we dare 
to be dull 
but although janke and others in americas heartland had nothing 
to do with the freewheeling deals and bungling behind the sampl 
fiasco theyre still liable for the bailout 
the guys who made prudent investments and are running an 
honest shop are paying for the sins of the guys who ran off with 
the loot it just isnt fair said james grohl senior vice 
president of the 2400member us league of savings institutions 
janke said sampl failures elsewhere cost him an extra 80000 a 
year in operating costs higher insurance premiums triple the cost 
of federal oversight cuts in stock dividends 
and hes also lost face 
i really dont like to tell people what i do anymore he 
said i tell them im a banker 
there are millions of people like janke people who do not work 
for a troubled savings and loan and do not have accounts or loans 
with one people who do not live in towns where real estate values 
have plunged because of sampl problems people whose businesses have 
been unmolested by the crisis 
but every single one of them will suffer because of what what 
us rep jim leach riowa and a member of the house banking 
committee calls a fiscal vietnam and the biggest public 
gaffe of the century in terms of finance 
leach figures the sampl bailout will cost the average american 
family 20 a month for the next 30 years 
it would cost anywhere from 147 billion to 203 billion to set 
everything right if a check were written today according to 
various estimates 
the latest government estimate is 160 billion plus another 
340 billion in interest to pay it off over 30 years for a total 
of 500 billion 
people have a hard time comprehending greed at so large a 
scale leach said 
so what do these monumental numbers really mean 
the 500 billion tab is enough to give 2000 to every man 
woman and child in the united states or 100 to every human on 
the planet 
with just the 160 billion uncle sam could pay for the next 53 
years worth of the governments aids research education and care 
he also could just about wipe out the federal budget deficit 
estimated at 169 billion for 1991 
but lets make this easier and focus on a trifling 1 billion 
even donald trump could appreciate 1 billion which was the 
cost of his taj mahal casino in atlantic city a mere 1 billion 
would cover the 450000 monthly allowance outlined by his 
creditorbankers for the next 185 years and if the courts approve 
the 25 million divorce settlement with his wife ivana trump 
could afford 40 failed marriages 
he also could buy a 40000 cadillac every day for the next 72 
years 
of course 1 billion is pennies compared to what some 
economists say the tab ultimately could balloon to 1 trillion 
only one segment has deep enough pockets to make good on the 
money thats the us taxpayer said james barth former chief 
economist for the office of thrift supervision and now a finance 
professor at auburn university 
the money spent on the sampl bailout is money that could have 
been spent on education travel home food it just means people 
will have less money barth said its a redistribution of a 
good part of their income in ways they wouldnt ordinarily want 
to 
some economists dont believe a tax increase will be needed 
because the government will cover the damage over time but that 
doesnt mean the crisis will have no trickledown impact 
in the long run you might see slightly higher interest 
rates said robert litan a senior fellow with the brookings 
institution 
the bailouts price tag has prompted the rumblings of a regional 
war roughly between the rust belt and the sun belt not only will 
taxpayers have to bail out the sampl bunglers but the northeast and 
midwest will have to bail out the south and west 
edward hill a professor at cleveland state university 
calculated that 37 states and the district of columbia will be net 
losers because theyll have to ship money to 13 states who come out 
ahead 
the bailout will result in a massive geographic transfer of 
wealth to the southwest as well as a transfer of wealth from 
taxpayers to savers hill said 
assuming a bailout cost of 203 million hill figured that 
residents of connecticut will be hardest hit each paying out 
1237 more in taxes than they receive in money from the bailout 
texas residents will benefit by 4775 per person other big 
winners are new mexico 4349 arkansas 4106 and arizona 
2143 
a bill sponsored by the 18state northeastmidwest congressional 
coalition would shift a greater share of the bailout to the south 
and west particularly texas 
this bill is saying that any state which helped create the 
10gallon hatful of trouble for the rest of the country must be 
held accountable said us rep olympia j snowe rmaine 
in wisconsin where only two of 66 sampls have failed the bailout 
will cost 592 for every man woman and child according to hills 
study 
the inequity isnt lost on conservative midwesterners like 
joseph sulewski of the milwaukee suburb of shorewood a 49yearold 
wisconsin gas co worker who can add the sampl bailout to his 
mortgage car loan utilities and other monthly bills 
isnt what happened like embezzling but doing it legally 
its a crying shame sulewski said everybodys going to pay 
for it for years and years everybodys going to be hurting for 
that

the royal opera has opened its new season with a 
revival of its celebrated production of turandot and unanswered 
questions about the companys financial future 
the opera house in covent garden is spending its way toward a 
945 million deficit seat prices are the highest in its history 
and extra money from sponsors and the government is looking harder 
than ever to come by 
there was 10 minutes applause for the cast headed by dame 
gwyneth jones the welsh soprano and a covent garden favorite 
monday night in her 49th performance of the title role and russian 
tenor vladimir popov now a us citizen as prince calaf 
they were joined by conductor sir colin davis who was presented 
with the royal opera house silver medal to mark his 25th 
anniversary with covent garden 
few have done more for opera for this country and this 
house said general director jeremy isaacs from the stage 
the company premiered this production of giacomo puccinis last 
opera in los angeles in 1984 at the dorothy chandler pavilion and 
claims that it revived interest in opera in that city 
the revival was dedicated to dame eva turner the british 
dramatic soprano who died on june 16 at age 98 turandot was her 
finest role between 1928 and 1947 for 10 years after her 
retirement she was a professor of voice at the university of 
oklahoma 
the royal opera is staging nine new productions this season 
starting with siegfried on oct 4 as well as revivals the 
house is open six days a week with opera and ballet and claims to 
be the busiest in europe 
the best stalls seats on monday were 168 best grand tier seats 
were 190 the cheapest seats which have a restricted view range 
from 850 to 38 
rodney milnes editor of opera magazine other critics note that 
although its the wellheeled who are mostly seen at covent garden 
the opera house is the recipient of the largest slug of public 
money for the performing arts in britain 283 million this year 
taxpayers especially those outside southeast england which 
contributes 84 percent of the opera house audiences are hardly 
getting a good return for the money taken from them milnes 
complained in londons evening standard 
we are pleased to get the show on the road again said ewen 
balfour director of public relations at the opera house after 
mondays opening 
we are as concerned about the high prices as everyone else 
some seats are double those at the bastille the new opera house in 
paris but our income still isnt enough he said 
he said salaries account for 60 percent of the budget and 
increased by 8 to 9 percent last year when the opera houses 
increase from the government was 17 percent 
our turnover last season was 39 million pounds 737 
million attendances averaged 92 percent for opera and 91 percent 
for ballet and yet we face a deficit we are now waiting to see 
what the government will give us in november balfour said 
he said the venerable opera house opened in 1858 is busier 
than ever and has had to take on extra staff to operate an 
allnight stage crew 
its a chicken and egg situation if you want to do exciting 
things you have to charge high prices if you charge high prices 
you have to give the public something very good its distressing 
for us that the middle income group especially school teachers 
can no longer afford to come and that they arent introducing 
people to the delights of coming here he said

a bronze sculpture at the base of a 
neonoutlined 16story office tower here honors real estate 
developer conley wolfswinkels parents without whose love and 
guidance this building never would have been possible 
not exactly western savings amp loan association and ultimately 
the us taxpayer helped too 
the nowdefunct sampl paid wolfswinkel 525 million the amount 
of his loan for the tower three years ago government regulators 
sold the building this summer for 203 million 
loss to taxpayers more than 32 million just on that building 
such dealings multipled over and over again across the country 
illustrate where the money went in the sampl fiasco 
first texas savings and loan loaned 325 million to build 
stonebridge ranch a planned community north of dallas first texas 
failed and regulators this year could muster only 61 million for 
stonebridge from a japanese investor leaving taxpayers on the hook 
for 264 million 
tales of fraud highliving and ripoffs dominate the coverage 
of the sampl crisis but analysts and regulators say only a fraction 
of the money lost estimated to run as high as 500 billion was 
stolen outright most of it was gambled away on risky real estate 
deals 
it was like staking poker players to piles of chips while 
allowing them to keep any winnings even as the government agreed 
to pay all the losses said sherman maisel former federal 
reserve board governor 
fraud accounted for about 3 percent of the total being absorbed 
by taxpayers according to consultant bert ely the bulk of the 
losses come from devalued real estate and excessive interest rates 
paid by sick sampls to attract depositors 
the crookbashing is troubling they make convenient 
scapegoats to avoid focusing attention on the failed government 
policies that caused this ely said 
weve wasted the economic resources of the 1980s on unneeded 
investments he said were already had the binge now weve 
got the hangover for it 
ely estimates the loss today at 147 billion he figures 28 
billion went down the drain in property that is worth less now than 
when it was financed or bought by a thrift 
the rest was lost in a variety of ways 
excess interest paid to attract deposits or just to keep pace 
with the highflying thrifts that offered abovemarket rates to 
provide more cash to gamble 
excess operating costs exorbitant salaries unneeded branch 
offices lavish decorations jets yachts and fancy parties ely 
said 
fixedrate mortgages made before 1983 and squeezed by higher 
interest rates 
interest paid to keep ailing thrifts alive instead of closing 
them and paying off depositors immediately 
its a massive government failure said robert litan a 
senior fellow at the brookings institution most of the money was 
lost in wild gambles the government let them do it there was no 
supervision 
some profited through the whole episode people who originally 
sold land made a bundle money was paid to contractors developers 
suppliers and construction workers in a building boom that went 
bust when regional economies nosedived 
but fraud has generated the biggest headlines even though the 
us justice department estimates criminal acts in about 30 percent 
of the failed sampls 
youve got a lot of creeps in there but criminal fraud didnt 
create the problem said doug tillet spokesman for the justice 
department we see an awful lot of stupidity and bad judgment 
thats not prosecutable

virginia zimmer watches for death 
its grim work but she cant let death have the final say 
at st alphonsus regional medical center zimmer matches organ 
donors with people from all over the country who also watch for 
death 
there are miracles and she somehow finds ways to turn grief and 
tragedy into joy 
i tell people its the gift of life its the finest gift we 
can give she says 
for the thousands of seriously ill with diseased hearts kidneys 
and livers the choice is simple a transplant or death they wait 
anxiously for the call that another person has died so they might 
live 
the donors share a profile they die quickly violently it may 
be a traffic accident a blood vessel exploding in the brain a 
suicide in any event the brain is destroyed while the organs 
still function 
almost always theyre young 
theyre 16 to 20yearolds thats why its difficult 
theyre the hope of the family they die and its tough says 
zimmer 55 
the awful moment comes when the family is told their loved one 
is dead machines can maintain the organs in a braindead person 
for a couple of days at most zimmer must work quickly 
compassionately 
gently she tells the family of the donor program she answers 
questions the grieving struggle to understand 
eighty percent say yes she says ive never had anybody 
get angry with a request to donate they can only say no 
in 1986 zimmer volunteered to coordinate organ donation at st 
alphonsus on top of her regular duties as a nurse educator her 24 
years as an intensivecare nurse were ideal training 
the volunteer work grew into the fulltime position she assumed 
in august working with all the hospitals in southwestern idaho a 
top priority for zimmer is to educate the public about the donor 
program 
her first year she managed 13 donor cases there were 14 the 
following year then eight and only four donors so far this year 
in any given year only 8500 to 12000 people can be considered 
to be donors says wanda bond a spokeswoman for the united network 
for organ sharing in richmond va 
it may be that hospitals already burdened with bureaucracy and 
red tape see the donor program as just one more thing to do bond 
says she also thinks stricter drunken driving laws higher seat 
belt use and motorcycle helmet laws all may affect the number of 
available donors 
nationally donors of solid organs such as the heart lungs 
liver kidneys and pancreas fell from 3975 two years ago to 3898 
in 1989 yet the number of transplants rose more than 5 percent to 
13384 through multiple use of donor organs 
zimmer says up to a halfdozen recipients may benefit from the 
organs of one donor a donor also can provide eyes for cornea 
transplants bone to graft onto shattered limbs and skin to protect 
burn patients 
when they can donate it helps the donor family almost as much 
as the recipient family zimmer says 
after a patient has died and permission is obtained from 
relatives to donate organs or tissue an intricate choreography 
involving scores of people is performed most of the work must be 
done within 12 to 18 hours 
we treat the donor respectfully says merry reed an 
intensivecare nurse at st alphonsus but we cant treat them as 
though theyre going to get well now youre working to save 
another life or three or four lives with the organs 
if the heart or other organs have been donated zimmer is on the 
phone with the national organsharing network for its lists of the 
people needing organ transplants 
the lists are brutally efficient only the most feeble rise to 
the top the likelihood of survival through an organ transplant 
increases only as a persons medical condition deteriorates 
lab work is done to check for hepatitis and aids blood pressure 
is stabilized the chest is measured the kidneys are kept working 
organ recovery teams fly in from salt lake city or portland ore 
a heart must be transplanted within four hours after being 
removed from a donor lungs two hours a liver 24 hours kidneys 
72 hours 
more than 17000 people in the united states are waiting for 
kidney transplants nearly 1000 need liver transplants an 
additional 1700 need hearts 
nine months ago virginia zimmers own son joe died in a car 
wreck he was 28 and strong a former marine the nurses at st 
alphonsus out of respect for their coworkers feelings didnt 
ask her the obvious question 
zimmer in her grief didnt remember until it was too late 
i could have donated his eyes she says 
she pauses 
the ones who feel badly are the ones who werent asked

many government employees refer to joao 
santana as the executioner because he makes heads roll others call 
him judas or satan 
santanas official title is secretary of public administration 
his daunting task is to clean up brazils bloated and corrupt 
government bureaucracy 
it is no surprise that in a nation where one in six citizens 
works for some level of government he has many enemies 
in four months santana ordered 200000 civil servants fired 
retired or sent home with pay but no extras in hopes they would 
resign according to government figures that is half the target 
president fernando collor de mello who took office march 15 
announced for his entire fiveyear term 
santana also oversaw the auction of 20 governmentowned 
mansions formerly used rentfree by top bureaucrats and ordered 
the sale of 19700 apartments 4800 vehicles and five airplanes 
when he took office collor said the bureaucracy was consuming 
95 percent of tax revenues and causing a 31 billion deficit which 
was considered the main reason inflation had reached 5000 percent 
a year 
he ordered a 25 percent reduction in the governments 16 
million employees as part of his antiinflation plan and chose 
santana 32 to do the job 
after santana went to work the government employees union of 
brasilia held a symbolic funeral for the executioner and he 
even received physical threats 
santana said he feels most brazilians support him 
i dont consider myself a satan and the administrative reform 
is not the work of the devil he said in an interview on the 
contrary the reform will exorcize the states infernal inability 
to attend taxpayers who deserve good services 
the reforms including wiping out 12 cabinet ministries and 
closing dozens of state companies and agencies cut expenses in 
june to just 50 percent of tax revenues he said 
politicians now seek his endorsement and people stop him in the 
street to urge greater reductions he said 
a month ago few congressmen wanted to have their picture 
taken next to me santana told the interviewer now many do i 
even taped political tv spots where i say im with this candidate 
because hes just like me 
santana entered politics as a leftist opponent of the military 
regimes that governed brazil for 21 years until 1985 in 1979 he 
helped found the marxistoriented workers party that now is the 
collor governments main opposition 
he later abandoned leftist politics graduated from the sao 
paulo univeristy law school and worked in the sao paulo state 
government when santanas friend zelia cardoso de mello was chosen 
as collors economy minister she recommended him to carry out the 
bureaucratic reform 
brazilian presidents have tried or promised to shrink the 
bureaucracy for 50 years without success 
jose sarney collors predecessor established a ministry of 
debureaucratization and declared in a speech spending is 
forbidden the bureaucracy got bigger 
joao geraldo piquet carneiro who directed the same task in the 
military years said the problem was not too many government 
workers but poor distribution of them 
the number of civil servants is not disproportional to the 
population of 150 million piquet carneiro said but added that 
it was easier to fire workers than to reassign them 
santana acknowledged the reforms had political enemies and 
had cost the president support in congress 
many dismissed employees have gone to court seeking 
reinstatement the government lost a court case on reducing the pay 
of workers sent home 
another obstacle is a clause in the 1988 constitution that says 
government workers with five years of seniority cannot be fired 
according to santana the main resistance is in brasilia the 
capital which has 70000 civil servants and rio a former capital 
that still has 160000 government functionaries 
a survey of 590 government workers in brasilia revealed to the 
surprise of many people that 58 percent felt the layoffs were 
necessary 
i sleep soundly santana said when i finish the reform we 
will have fewer public functionaries and more wellpaid 
professionals

its so damp and musty in jim lewis 
leaky office at nasas marshall space flight center that tiny 
mushrooms sometimes sprout on his mossflecked window sill 
down the hall mary spaulding leaves a garbage can near her door 
to catch drips from the ceiling that periodically flood the floor 
the sprawling concrete block structure which houses the 
electronic systems laboratory is the most dilapidated building at 
mashall marshall is nasas most dilapidated major field center 
the oldest section was built by the army in 1957 as part of 
redstone arsenal 
what we hope is we dont have legionnaires disease up 
there lewis said pointing to moldy ceiling tiles above his

nasas buildings are crumbling much as its image has this 
summer

in addition to leaky shuttles nasa has spent the summer 
contending with mirror flaws in the hubble space telescope that 
prevent a sharp focus communications problems with the magellan 
spacecraft orbiting venus and growing criticism over the proposed 
space station freedom 
still it is the daytoday working conditions that are the 
immediate worry of nasa employees nationwide the problem is aging 
buildings and not enough money to maintain them according to the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
almost all of nasas facilities were built in the mid1960s 
said ted ankrum who oversees the agencys construction and 
maintenance projects its all coming up on 30 years and 30 
years is about the lifetime for roofs its the lifetime for 
heating and air conditioning systems its the lifetime for paving 
and runways 
its the lifetime for very many things so that what weve got 
are a lot of building shells and a lot of things inside that need 
to be replaced 
the tobefixed list is a handymans nightmare 
leaky roofs abound including the one on the 525feettall 
vehicle assembly building at floridas kennedy space center the 
second largest building in the world in terms of volume rain on 
occasion has splashed down on computers in the adjoining launch 
control center 
ventilation systems and heating boilers are so old that parts 
are no longer available and nasa must make its own components 
obsolete circuit breakers at kennedy and ames research center in 
mountain view calif pose so much danger that power must be 
turned off before workers can test them 
while less menacing old electric switchboards at langley 
research center in hampton va look like they came from the 
bride of frankenstein movie ankrum said langley nasas oldest 
field center was established in 1917 as the first national 
aeronautic laboratory 
nasas northernmost center lewis research center in cleveland 
has the worst roads in the agency theyre cracked and potholed 
inside the older buildings asbestos fills ceilings walls and 
steam piping it is a problem at other centers too 
the decay prompted nasa this year to conduct its first 
agencywide study of field center maintenance a rating system was 
needed to help nasa appropriate repair funds to the places most in 
need ankrum said 
of the 14 sites included in the threemonth survey the worst 
was michoud assembly facility in new orleans a subsidiary of 
marshall marshall was next with more maintenance problems than 
any of the seven other major field centers 
several of the smaller field installations which like michoud 
report to field centers were excluded from the study because of 
financial constraints ankrum said 
nasa officials insist none of the maintenance problems 
jeopardize workers safety every so often though shuttle 
operations fall victim to building disrepair 
last april a corroded pipe sprayed water on electrical 
equipment at kennedy the accident interrupted final prelaunch 
testing of the hubble telescope inside the shuttle discovery 
in august following atlantis move from the launch pad back to 
the vehicle assembly building work on the leaky shuttle was halted 
half a day when water dripped from a sprinkler onto power 
transformers a worn valve was to blame 
nasa officials say they are doing what they can 
new buildings are going up at just about every center or are 
about to restorations are planned including a 135 million 
modernization of the building in which lewis spaulding and about 
500 others work 
had it been maintained properly it might not cost so much to 
modernize said edwin jones chief of project management at 
marshall 
its like the old fram filter commercial ankrum said you 
change the oil now or you overhaul the engine later 
nasa is seeking 186 million for maintenance for fiscal 1991 
which begins oct 1 congress appropriated 141 million for the 
current fiscal year about 400 million will be needed annually for 
maintenance during the next few years ankrum said 
the agency also is requesting 175 million for restoration and 
modernization for fiscal 1991 up from the current 158 million 
i think weve gotten our message across said nasa 
administrator richard truly and that is that these hardtosell 
items like preventive maintenance you know it doesnt go 
anywhere it doesnt take any pictures its not very sexy if you 
will are very very important

pollsters asked new yorkers if they agreed with 
this statement to live in new york people need to be a little 
crazy more than half gave the only sane response yes 
in the poll commissioned by time magazine 52 percent adjusted 
their straitjackets and agreed that life here is indeed easier for 
the slightly daft 
there is no evidence that most residents of phoenix or atlanta 
have ever claimed that insanity enhances life in their communities 
do new yorkers really see themselves as teethgrinding 
neckbulging fistpounding loonies is the nations largest city 
also its craziest 
dr elliot wineburg a professor of clinical psychology at mount 
sinai hospital and an expert on urban stress was not convinced 
people like to go along with legends theyre admitting to a 
proud sort of craziness he said its a kind of boot camp 
attitude toward life in the city 
wineburg said many new yorkers lay claim not to psychosis but 
to the fanatics mania for opera stocks sculpture or basketball 
all of which the city has in unrivaled abundance 
but he conceded that the city probably has a disproportionate 
number of stressrelated conditions such as headaches high blood 
pressure irritable bowels and ringing ears also an awful lot of 
people seem to talk to themselves while walking down fifth avenue 
this all may be linked to population density the country as a 
whole has about 63 people per square mile san francisco the 
second densest city has 14000 per mile 
new york city on the other hand has 23000 residents per 
square mile not including commuters and manhattan a whopping 
58000 overall new york is more than twice as dense as all but a 
few american cities 
unlike the rats in laboratory experiments who occupy an airy 
welllit cage new yorkers are packed into an environment of 
bursting water pipes runaway cabs late subway trains crumbling 
bridges and narrow sidewalks 
and they are in far more danger than most americans forget the 
comparisons to contemporary detroit or turn of the century dodge 
city there is no spot on the planet where more middle class people 
run a higher risk of being robbed at gunpoint 
fordham university sociologist marc miringoff has compiled an 
index of social health for the city based on factors such as 
crime drug and child abuse unemployment and school attendance 
since 1974 the index has declined from 75 on a scale of 100 to 44 
you can see this pathology in the street and it affects 
you he said it makes you feel as if you want to run 
a big problem is that many people feel they cant control this 
environment wineburg said when you commute over a bridge 
every day and you find out its going to be under construction for 
two years thats very upsetting 
when your car is stolen and it turns out a traffic officer did 
it thats very upsetting 
although the stress of the city may not cause mental illness 
wineburg said it can be the straw that breaks the camels back 
his advice to the stressed leave early if youre always late 
find someone with whom to share your urban horror stories learn 
not to internalize tension reward yourself at the end of the day 
or week see a doctor 
no problem there except during august when most doctors go on 
vacation although the city has only 41 percent of the states 175 
million residents it has 80 percent of its 2500 psychiatrists 
there also are droves of psychologists especially in manhattan 
which has 2194 of the citys 3153 
many of these people will tell you new yorkers arent crazy 
just different humorist calvin trillin a 30year resident says 
that if a 300pound man costumed as eleanor of aquitaine walked 
onto a crosstown bus carrying both an attache case and a rib roast 
the other passengers might glance up for a second 
then he says theyd go back to their tabloids

editors a sri lankan journalist recently slipped into the 
jaffna peninsula virtually cut off from the world since the 
governments latest offensive against tamil rebels began aug 22 
he wishes to remain anonymous for reasons of personal security 
this is his report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as the shadows of two helicopter 
gunships loomed over the city people ran for cover shouting 
heli heli to warn their neighbors 
minutes later highcaliber machine guns opened up a deadly 
chatter of fire from the sky bullets thudded into walls shattered 
the few remaining glass panes and ricocheted off tile roofs 
then came the bombers ten planes dropped bombs over densely 
populated jaffna powdering the debris of already devastated houses 
despite the intensity of the sri lankan air force attack on the 
town held by tamil rebels there were few casualties 
we are like rats said sathasivan krishnamurthy a 
60yearold newspaper vendor they cant kill us because we go 
into the ground 
his house has a trench dug into its floor but no roof 
krishnamurthys wife and daughters cook and wash dishes in the 
trench apparently unconcerned during the bombing runs 
in the three months since the rebels resumed their war against 
the government jaffna a town of 60000 people has come under 
almost daily bombardment 
its main market on an open square in the center of town is a 
heap of rubble so is the bus terminal the railroad station is a 
mass of twisted railway lines and concrete the coaches of what was 
once a passenger train lie on their side pockmarked with bullet 
holes 
the 1200bed jaffna hospital is empty shot full of bullets 
stray cattle graze on the unkempt lawn mongrels lie in the 
corridors 
the tamil tiger guerrillas who hold the town claim the 
government has killed at least 4000 civilians in the jaffna 
peninsula and other districts of northeastern sri lanka since the 
fighting resumed june 11 military officials say there have been 
civilian casualties but refuse to give a number no one is sure of 
the real toll 
ponniah balasingham a member of jaffnas municipal corporation 
estimates damage to his town at 39 million i dont know how we 
can get people to pick up their lives again he said the 
situation is hopeless 
perhaps for the first time in the 7yearold war for an 
independent tamil homeland public opinion is turning against the 
rebels who patrol the streets with automatic rifles 
residents dont talk easily to strangers but when they do many 
express resentment some dont like being ordered around by the 
teenage cadres others fear extortion 
yogaratnam yogi one of the senior leaders of the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam says taxes are levied on those who wish to 
leave the city for safer areas and those who have relatives working 
abroad 
we want each family to give us two gold sovereigns about 
250 if they decide to abandon jaffna the bespectacled yogi 
said it is part of the war effort we also take this from people 
who have relatives working abroad 
residents said that amount usually in the form of jewelry has 
been collected from every family regardless of whether they want 
to leave or receive money from abroad the tigers issue receipts 
which allow residents to obtain passes for moving around the city 
the residents said 
people who dont have passes are often shot they said 
besides the attacks lives are imperiled by a drastic shortage 
of food yogi claimed many people in jaffna have starved to death 
but said he did not have figures a municipal official speaking on 
condition of anonymity also said there had been some starvation 
deaths but he too had no figures 
yogi said at least 150 to 200 tigers had died in the fighting 
including at least 100 in the bid to capture jaffna fort the only 
government garrison in town 
the government says about 1000 rebels have been killed 
more than 200 policemen and soldiers are stranded in the 
starshaped 17th century garrison subsisting on occasional 
airdrops of food around the fort is a no mans land the air force 
has leveled the buildings facing the fort to deprive the rebels of 
cover for an advance 
two hundred yards away the tiger fighters are dug into a maze 
of underground bunkers by the governments count tiger snipers 
have picked off 13 of the forts defenders who numbered 250 before 
the siege 
before june 11 the tamil war had killed at least 11000 people 
jaffna the largest town on the northern peninsula of the same 
name is part of the region the tamils claim as their homeland 
it has always been at the forefront of the fighting between sri 
lankas tamil minority and the sinhalese who control the government 
and army the tamils allege discrimination by the sinhalese who 
comprise 75 percent of the population 
from 1983 when the insurgency began until 1987 the peninsula 
was under attack and a blockade similar to the one now in 
operation in 1987 indian peacekeeping troops landed in jaffna 
after a peace accord between the rebels and the government 
the peace plan failed and the rebels turned their guns on the 
indians jaffna came under the command of the indian soldiers but 
the rebel presence remained powerful 
the indians left the indian ocean island this spring after 2 
years of unsuccesful attempts to quell the tigers a brief peace 
ended june when the militants reneged on a ceasefire with the 
government 
attackers have found the city difficult to enter by ground a 
single causeway links jaffna peninsula to the rest of the island 
nation and it has been mined by the rebels the coast offers 
little facility for landing and is also wellguarded 
whats left is aerial bombardment which doesnt seem to daunt 
the rebels but has destroyed any semblance of normal life for 
civilians 
scouring shops for food going for a haircut or to meet friends 
or even moving from one room to another are abruptly cut short by 
the call heli heli 
then its a dive for the nearest trench as the helicopter 
gunships swoop down again

in this city of contrasts fear is the 
common denominator its the tie that binds rich and poor the 
powerful to the powerless the denizens of ramshackle boxlike 
houses with the elite in the corridors of the presidential palace 
you dont understand fear said one iraqi who nervously 
cast sidelong glances while speaking to a western reporter on a 
baghdad street here we live with fear every day 
executions are common in iraq for a variety of offenses western 
diplomats said a joke about president saddam hussein can earn a 
careless comic years in prison some people simply disappear 
there are an awful lot of executions here said one european 
diplomat mondays and thursdays are the hanging days in the 
prisons 
the climate of fear is so pervasive that iraqis tell western 
reporters they are not particularly frightened of war with the 
united states after eight years of fighting iran theyre 
accustomed to war 
but they are afraid of the un sanctions afraid their children 
might go hungry and afraid to complain or openly question the 
government or its policies 
some western journalists were encouraged by information minister 
latif nasaif jasim to talk to iraqis the journalists were then 
detained for hours for doing just that a diplomat later cautioned 
reporters about interviewing iraqis on the street 
iraq explained one diplomat has a state security apparatus 
that employs about 100000 people there are informers everywhere 
but despite the elaborate internal security system there are 
signs that iraqs climate of fear extends as far as the 
presidential palace 
after what happened in bulgaria and romania saddam hired 
three foreign security agencies for his own security said one 
diplomat referring to the collapse of the stalinist dictatorships 
in eastern europe 
the agencies revamped the presidents personal security 
operation training iraqi bodyguards to be better sharper the 
diplomat said 
hes scared scared of assassination said a european 
diplomat of saddam he hasnt been with the people in ages 
however foreign diplomats with long experience in iraq insist 
that western hopes that saddam will be toppled in a popular revolt 
are just wishful thinking 
iraqis may go through moments of despair but dont think they 
will overthrow the government said one senior western diplomat 
there simply isnt a parliamentary democracy ready to emerge 
saddam has ruthlessly stamped out any opposition said the 
diplomats scores of army officers were reportedly executed for 
opposing iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
theres no opposition here that i know of you can be assured 
that saddam would hear of it before i would and then you can be 
assured there would be no opposition by the time i heard about 
it said one diplomat 
if i could think of them they be dead agreed a european 
diplomat 
any attempt to kill saddam would have to come from foreign 
assassins or from his tight circle of close associates the 
diplomats said and they contend that saddam is keenly alert 
while you were playing ball in your backyard he was 
organizing coup detats he has spent his whole life taking part in 
such things a western diplomat said whatever else he is we 
have to accept that hes a very clever man 
to protect himself saddam has given special privileges to the 
men in the army and state security who with their families make up 
a significant portion of iraqs estimated population of 17 million 
he has cleverly courted the people who officially own guns 
despite the fear and repression diplomats in baghdad contend 
saddam has a lot of genuine followers 
pictures of saddam dot the landscape in baghdad they hang from 
buildings and on the walls in offices hotels apartments and 
restaurants 
the president in a variety of poses and dress waves or smiles 
benevolently from billboardsized portraits in major traffic 
circles 
many people support him from deep in the heart said one 
diplomat he has improved life for many people and taught them to 
be proud 
they won a war now theyre defying a superpower it looks 
like they can do anything they want as a nation and no one can stop 
them

president bush goes before congress and the 
people tonight at the pinnacle of his power in the persian gulf 
crisis with the country and much of the world behind him but a big 
question mark ahead of him 
assume 90 days pass saddam husseins iraq has neither gone to 
war nor withdrawn from kuwait the american troops are still 
sweating it out in saudi arabia starving hostages are paraded on 
television the embargo is fraying a recession and inflation are 
setting in the president appears to be a prisoner of his policies 
it sounds like what happened and then some to jimmy carter 
who saw his popularity surge when americans were taken hostage in 
the us embassy in iran in 1979 then fall as low as it has gone 
in the modern presidency as carter seemed obsessed by the crisis 
by learning from carter bush can avoid the pitfalls of a 
draggedout crisis say observers of politics public opinion and 
international affairs 
their conclusion america can adjust to this crisis even over 
the long haul 
one says bush may have made a mistake even by deciding to 
deliver tonights highprofile expectationsraising address to 
congress 
a bigdeal speech might not be the wisest thing for the 
president to do as far as keeping concern about the crisis under 
control and keeping the issue from becoming allconsuming says 
political scientist john mueller of the university of rochester 
author of war presidents and public opinion 
but the consensus seems to be that bush can keep public and 
world support behind him at least for the rest of the year even 
if the crisis turns into a stalemate and begins pinching at home 
i dont see it all unraveling for president bush says 
thomas mann a brookings institution expert on the ways of 
congress to the extent we avoid a hot war and continue to 
maintain overwhelming international solidarity the public will not 
desert the president nor will congress 
mann says bush has been able to avoid some of carters more 
obvious mistakes carter erred he says by stopping all 
government and mobilizing all attention on gaining the release of 
the hostages 
he says too that criticism of the president on other issues 
the state of the economy for example isnt going to take a 
holiday 
i think the consensus will be supportive of the president and 
his efforts until there are some really important consequences 
says ada w finifter a michigan state university political 
scientist and expert on public opinion 
by important consequences she means if we start getting a 
body count in a draggedout war the economy turns severely sour 
or the government has to cut popular spending programs 
as for stalemate she says weve had soldiers stationed all 
over the world for many many years diplomatic stalemate is not 
necessarily a problem 
a disagreeing view comes from patrick glynn an arms control 
adviser in the reagan administration he believes the crisis must 
be resolved next month if it to end favorably for the united states 
if we dont have a war or a diplomatic solution by october 
then weve lost and it will only be a matter of time glynn says 
our power position will erode public support will erode 
international solidarity will disintegrate and it will only be a 
matter of time before we are forced to make an unsatisfactory 
compromise an ambiguous solution is a bush defeat and a big 
defeat for the country 
madeleine albright who advised democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis on foreign policy in 1988 and teaches at 
georgetown university believes bush must keep explaining us 
policy if he wants to retain public support 
he is going to have to keep going on television or people will 
start wondering why they have to be there forever she says 
mueller of the university of rochester says bush would be wise 
to prepare the american people for a fairly long siege and then 
make a show of going about his business working on the deficit 
for example 
but mann of brookings says the other problems are so severe 
the sampl crisis the possible danger of a banking crisis a soft 
economy the budget deficit that bush might do well to focus on 
the middle east 
murray weidenbaum who was an economic adviser to president 
reagan says bush can expect a recession one seems likely in any 
event as the result of higher oil prices and lower supplies but 
he believes the downturn will be relatively short and mild 
its not the doubledigit unemployment and the doubledigit 
inflation of a decade ago says weidenbaum but its not going 
to be good news for the white house 
mueller foresees a national frustration setting in if the 
gulf situation turns into a holding operation but he think the 
public will understand if bush explains that going to war against 
iraq simply would result in too many american battle deaths 
he recalls the tremendous frustration the public felt after 
a 1983 barracks bomb killed 241 us marines in lebanon but reagan 
said he could not strike back because there was no target to hit 
people understood that they bought that

if edward norton were running for congress and 
his wife eleanor didnt mail their tax returns for eight years 
would that be the end of his career 
political analysts think probably not but they see dimmer 
prospects for his wife whose reallife district of columbia 
congressional bid appears to be sinking under the weight of her 
husbands tax revelations 
i cant recall a male candidate whos been penalized by 
something that his wife has done says jane danowitz director of 
the womens campaign fund and yet we see scores of women that 
people are attempting to bring down by citing their husbands 
indiscretions 
norton is not the only candidate having husband trouble this 
year 
democrat dianne feinstein is on the defensive about her wealthy 
husbands complex business dealings investments and contributions 
to her campaign for governor of california 
and in colorado democratic senate candidate josie heaths 
husband retired from manville corp earlier than he had planned 
when heaths primary opponent tried to tie her environmental record 
to manvilles asbestos problems 
eleanor holmes norton a law professor and former carter 
administration civil rights official had projected a winning image 
of strength and competence the disclosure that her husband hadnt 
filed the couples dc tax returns since 1982 and hadnt told 
her was disheartening to many supporters 
the norton debacle reminded many of geraldine ferraros ordeal 
as the democratic nominee for vice president in 1984 her husband 
john zaccaro initially caused a flap by refusing to release his 
income tax returns 
the situation escalated with questions about his fathers mafia 
ties an alleged illegal bribe and a conservatorship that he was 
found to have mishandled zaccaro eventually was acquitted by a 
jury of the bribery allegation 
two years before ferraros troubles democrat roxanne conlin was 
coasting toward the governorship of iowa then she disclosed that 
she and her husband a real estate investor were worth 22 
million but had paid no state income taxes and made only a token 
federal payment the year before 
voters didnt buy her explanation that she owed no taxes because 
of her husbands business losses especially since he was using 
real estate tax shelters that she had campaigned against 
a husbands dealings also proved fatal in 1987 when california 
secretary of state march fong eu dropped out of a democratic senate 
primary race rather than meet financial disclosure requirements 
regarding her income eu said her married relationship is such 
that she couldnt reveal details of her husbands interests in hong 
kong and singapore 
while recent history is dotted with troublesome husbands it is 
harder to find cases in which men have paid for their wives 
behavior 
there was marion javits lucrative consultant work for the 
iranian government which greatly embarrassed her husband the late 
sen jacob javits rny and sen mark hatfields wife triggered 
an ethics probe by accepting 55000 in real estate fees from a 
greek businessman 
however danowitz said these people made the personality 
column but not the front page its been a personal interest story 
rather than something terribly damaging to the politician 
the disparity is attributed by many to a patronizing view of 
women they are presumed to have less influence over their 
husbands less of a power base in the outside world and less 
potential for creating a conflict of interest 
its a double standard says john reilly the political 
adviser who was in charge of selecting the democrats 1984 vice 
presidential candidate its a throwback and it bothers me 
as more political wives pursue careers of their own analysts 
wonder if their activities will be scrutinized as carefully as 
those of the political husbands now in the spotlight 
it may be that when women come of age in all aspects of our 
society theyll have an equally detrimental effect on the 
campaigns of their spouses danowitz joked 
but for now the norton saga is another cautionary tale for 
women 
it certainly will redouble everyones efforts to ensure that 
women running for office know everything there is to be known about 
their family circumstances said wendy sherman executive 
director of emilys list a democratic fundraising group that 
endorsed norton

he is not the only one a little disconcerted about his situation 
no one among this group of friends and neighbors from allendale 
sc is happy about going to a potential war zone there is no 
strutting or bravado about the subject there is hardly any talk 
about iraq or saddam hussein or the geopolitical issues the 
parttime soldiers are caught up in 
they make bad jokes about being gassed they laugh about the 
combinations of bad timing and fate that have put them in the 
situation but there is surprisingly little complaining 
i never thought when i joined that id wind up in saudi 
arabia said henry harris a 51yearold teacher but its our 
duty to go 
the reasons the men did join the guard are varied money 
education security friendship some joined because they served in 
the regular military others because they hadnt 
i wanted to try something different said sgt earnest 
deloach i guess i got different 
the national guard offers members a variety of advantages the 
first is money for serving one weekend a month and two weeks each 
summer a guardsman can get a minimum of 4000 to 8000 a year 
depending on rank and years of service 
the salaries and other guard spending can add up for a 
community in allendale county the guard estimates it has a 1 
million impact on the economy 
a second reason to join is security if you complete 20 years of 
service you get a pension and guaranteed health care for you and 
your spouse more than half the 265th has 16 or more years of 
service already 
the guard also offers education you can attend special schools 
that teach you a trade there also are programs to help pay college 
expenses 
spc bobby youmans another prison guard had planned to start 
college under the program his callup has put those plans off 
but youmans spoke of another reason he joined the guard 11 years 
ago 
it gives you a chance to meet with other people he said 
you get to move in other circles instead of going with the same 
crowd every weekend you can hang out with the people you meet 
through your unit 
youmans 29 explained all this to young a newcomer who has 
been in the unit three years 
young is whippetthin and usually quiet until he steps out on 
the basketball court then he is a oneman cheering section 
talking incessantly yelling for the ball and giggling hoarsely 
when he runs down the court his face is in near joy 
young and youmans work together on the middle shift in the 
maximum security lockup at the allendale correctional institution 
riding back from the gym they wondered if the guys back at the 
prison miss them youmans thought they might 
young didnt seem to care 
thats one job i aint in no hurry to get back to he said

psst theyre getting a new carpet down the 
hall check it out psst guess whos buying new computers for the 
office psst 
the hallway chatter at the agriculture department is rife with 
such nuggets sometimes not so trivial in this time of budget 
balancing and spending crunches 
after all unless congress and the white house reach and 
agreement on how to whack 50 billion or so from next fiscal years 
federal budget itll get pretty serious for government workers by 
oct 1 
in the usda for example thousands of workers will have to take 
unpaid furloughs from their jobs as their contribution to fiscal 
solvency 
meat and poultry inspectors will take holidays toward the end of 
the first twoweek pay period of october county offices that make 
payments to farmers in crop programs will close early 
offices that take applications for emergency loans wont be 
servicing those quite so handily dairy farmers and other producers 
sharing in price support benefits will take pay cuts 
but if the government is so hard up why all the talk about the 
farmers home administration the agriculture stabilization and 
conservation service the foreign agricultural service and other 
agencies buying all sorts of goodies before the fiscal year runs 
out on sept 30 
theres always been some of this one midlevel employee 
said monday but i cant remember when its been this blatant to 
unload money 
the employee and several others who insisted on anonymity 
referred to their agencies splurging in the last few months money 
that comes out of the current fiscal years budget 
obviously one said the agencies would rather spend unused or 
otherwise unneeded funds on expanding or remodeling offices with 
new furniture drapes computer equipment and other jobrelated 
devices than to lose the money by not spending it at all 
kelly shipp chief spokeswoman for agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter and director of the departments office of public affairs 
discounted such talk and said yearend spending is highly highly 
scrutinized by federal procurement officials 
certain deadlines and procedures have to be met by those who 
spend usda money she said and policies are in place so there 
isnt unwise spending as the fiscal year winds down 
but shipp said there are lots of variables in government 
procurement and that often new purchases are put off until the end 
of the year when its clearer how much money is available 
you put off things that are legitimate purchases she said 
you want to make sure there are adequate funds so there are some 
legitimate reasons why people wait till the year end 
one of the unwritten rules among bureaucrats is to guard against 
having next years spending request cut sharply by the office of 
management and budget in the white house or by an economizing 
appropriations committee on capitol hill 
after all if the forest service or the extension service isnt 
using all the money authorized in 1990 why should additional funds 
be provided in 1991 
thats the vicious circle of how we legislate shipp said in 
a recent interview its not so much the mentality of the 
bureaucrats its the way the rules are set up if theres a 
weakness its that sometimes the congressional appropriations 
committee will look at your current services and cut you back 
thus she said an agency doesnt get any credit for not 
spending money it had available 
you cant carry over money so the system doesnt have any 
incentive built into it to encourage savings the spokeswoman 
said im surprised with the way people do try to save money 
people do everybody tries to save money 
shipp recently moved into another office as part of her new 
assignment as usdas director of public affairs she kept the old 
carpet but wants it purged of silverfish and any other stray bugs 
that might be present

the bush administration is threatening to veto 
a bill that would impose restrictions on the cable tv industry 
beset by consumer complaints of price gouging poor service and 
unfair marketing 
the house on monday approved by a voice vote legislation to 
impose federal limits on the price of basic cable service it would 
force price rollbacks on the worst offenders and open up the video 
entertainment business to new forms of competition 
the legislation which now goes to the senate would partially 
reregulate an industry that has grown rapidly since deregulation 
in 1984 and in some areas consumer advocates say has begun to 
look like a runaway monopoly 
this bill will not only allow the federal communications 
commission to rein in the renegades in the cable industry but it 
also takes realistic steps to ensure competition so consumers will 
have real choices in the future regarding video services said 
rep edward markey dmass chairman of the house 
telecommunications subcommittee 
a similar bill was approved by the senate commerce committee in 
june and awaits action by the full chamber 
the bush administration adamantly opposes the bill and the 
office of management and budget said monday the presidents top 
advisers would recommend a veto if the legislation were to win 
congressional approval 
an administration statement said among other problems the 
measure may violate the first amendment because it prescribes rules 
for the signals a cable system must carry 
rather than impose regulations the administration argued 
congress should consider opening new competitive opportunities in 
the industry by allowing telephone companies now barred from the 
cable television business to enter the field 
under the house measure the fcc would be required to set a 
maximum allowable price for basic cable service defined as all 
local commercial and public broadcasts together with any public 
educational or governmentalaccess programming the basic package 
could also include cspan which broadcasts congressional 
activities at the option of the cable company 
the commission also would be required to monitor service charges 
imposed on subscribers for any changes in the type of service they 
receive that provision stems from complaints that some cable 
operators charge excessive fees to discourage subscribers from 
switching to lowercost options 
the fcc would not be able to regulate rates charged for premium 
channels such as disney showtime and home box office but would be 
empowered to force price rollbacks on cable systems with rates 
deemed unreasonable or abusive 
since the 1984 cable act deregulated the industry the number of 
cable subscribers has soared along with complaints about high 
prices bad service and unfair marketing practices that force 
consumers to buy services they dont want 
the industry has grown into an unregulated monopoly in which 
quality goes down while prices go up said rep dennis eckart 
dohio the bill approved by the house gives local governments more 
clout in making sure local companies live up to their franchise 
agreements while opening the field to competition from technologies 
such as direct satellite broadcasts he said 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
has reported that from 1987 through 1989 rates for the 
lowestpriced cable service rose an average of 43 percent from 
1114 to 1595 per subscriber while the average number of basic 
channels rose from 24 to 31 the price increase was far higher than 
the rate of inflation for that period

the bush administration is trying to line up saudi 
arabia egypt and syria in an informal alliance to isolate iraq 
but israel long americas most reliable friend in the middle 
east could wind up being the odd man out 
as the united states grows closer to the three arab countries 
its strategic dependence on israel for such missions as 
prepositioning weapons and support facilities grows less critical 
egypt and saudi arabia hesitant only a few years ago to be 
closely identified with the united states have been driven by 
their fear of iraqs president saddam hussein into unabashed ties 
with washington 
they are ready to create a new and permanent security structure 
with the united states in the persian gulf 
and syria has suddenly become candidate to join the coalition 
despite its record of human rights abuses and terrorism 
accusations including sponsorship of a radical palestinian group 
suspected in the bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland in 
december 1988 in which 280 people perished 
baker announced monday at nato headquarters in brussels 
belgium that he will go to damascus to meet with president hafez 
assad 
the purpose baker said was to explore how we might cooperate 
to achieve what happens to be our mutual goals 
he said the joint aim was to isolate saddam with a strict 
economic boycott and to confront him with an international ground 
and sea force 
baker acknowledged the united states had differences and 
difficulties with syria and would discuss them with assad when 
they meet friday but baker did not dwell on the terrorism and 
human rights problems 
while constructing this new alliance the bush administration 
has begun to put more pressure on israel to make peace with 
palestinians and to return territory syria and jordan lost in their 
humiliating defeat in the sixday war of 1967 
president bush and baker have revived consideration of an 
international peace conference it is an idea that drives israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir up the wall because he fears that a 
sovietarab coalition would force unfavorable terms on jerusalem 
bush on sunday also called for implementing sooner rather 
than later 1967 and 1973 un security council resolutions 
providing for israel to give up the golan heights to syria and the 
west bank to jordan 
the president made the statement in helsinki finland at the 
windup of his summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
it obviously pleased gorbachev who said the arabisraeli 
dispute was of equal concern with the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
even more in fact he said 
bush and baker also have reversed the twodecadeold us policy 
of trying to undercut soviet influence in the middle east baker 
called that approach old thinking 
israel has been taking the administrations advice and 
maintained a low profile since iraq invaded kuwait five weeks ago 
the united states after all had adopted the israeli view that 
iraq posed a grave danger in the volatile middle east and was 
organizing a campaign designed to cut saddam down to size 
israeli foreign minister david levy met with baker in washington 
last thursday and emerged on a firstname basis praising bush and 
baker as courageous 
mr secretary or rather my friend jim i can go home with a 
positive feeling and happy fully believing in our possibility of 
cooperating and working together levy said 
perhaps that spirit still prevails 
even as the united states proceeded with its new makeshift 
alliance former israeli defense minister yitzhak shamir said 
recently i believe the us will achieve its goal and the 
situation will return to what it was before the iraqi invasion 
and yet bakers mission to damascus after he completes talks 
here thursday with soviet leaders will draw the united states 
closer to the arabs with unforeseen consequences for israel 
in the meantime the administrations plan to isolate iraq is 
being tested by the restoration of diplomatic relations by baghdad 
with iran

the first large activation of reserve us 
cargo ships is behind schedule but the navy says its satisfied 
with the fleets performance in transporting supplies to the 
persian gulf 
the navy has activated 42 ships of the 96ship ready reserve 
force but 26 of them did not meet individual readiness timetables 
of either five 10 or 20 days according to official figures 
supplied to the associated press 
the crisis in the gulf region provided the navy with its first 
opportunity to activate the ready reserve force created in 1976 
and positioned in ports around the country 
vice adm stanley r arthur deputy chief of naval operations 
for logistics said there were glitches in getting the reserve 
fleet ready to transport helicopters tanks howitzers and other 
equipment 
but he told a house merchant marine subcommittee that the 
vessels mostly of 1960s and 1970s vintage have exceeded 
expectations 
delays were caused in part by equipment failures including 
problems with steam boilers and by the time necessary to find 
merchant seamen to run the ships 
some ships have been delayed for weeks while others missed 
their deadlines by only a day 
the figures were provided to the associated press by the 
maritime administration a transportation department agency that 
maintains the cargo ships until theyre needed by the navys 
military sealift command 
seven ships met their timetables and nine were not counted 
against the deadlines because they needed major repairs the navy 
activated these nine ships knowing they would not meet the 
timetables maritime administration officials said 
the ships are crucial to supplying us forces in saudi arabia 
because heavy military equipment will not fit in the containers 
used in modern cargo vessels 
the reserve force includes roll onroll off ships where 
equipment can be driven up and down ramps break bulk carriers 
where equipment is placed on platforms and then hoisted on the 
vessels ships that carry barges or other floating devices that can 
be sent with their equipment down rivers and ships that have 
cranes aboard to load and unload cargo without the need for 
unloading facilities at a port 
among the ready reserve force ships activated so far all but 
one were assigned either a five or 10day period for the maritime 
administration to make them ready for navy sealift duty 
of those in the fiveday period 24 were delivered to the navy 
late four were tendered on time and seven were in need of repairs 
and therefore not counted against the timetable 
among the 10day ships two were delivered late three were 
turned over before the deadline and one was in need of repair 
the single 20day ship was in a repair yard and not counted 
against the timetable although it was fixed and given to the navy 
before the deadline 
the ready reserve force is part of the 217 ships in the national 
defense reserve fleet that are considered militarily useful 
many of the vessels date back to the world war ii era congress 
is considering legislation that would force about 100 of the oldest 
ships to be sold for scrap to us salvage firms 
arthur said three of those ships are in the ready reserve fleet 
including two that were activated but the rest are in the portion 
of the national defense fleet that is unlikely to be called to duty 
those ships built before jan 1 1946 would under the 
legislation be sold to domestic salvage companies 
these world war iiera ships are floating rust buckets said 
rep william broomfield rmich who with rep ron wyden dore 
sponsored the bill to junk the older ships in the fleet 
during a monday subcommittee hearing the two pressed for 
passage of their bill 
i do not pretend to be an expert in maritime affairs but i 
recognize junk when i see it broomfield said added wyden 
these are the oldest most decrepit portions of the fleet and 
they serve no useful purpose 
but robert martinez deputy administrator of the maritime 
administration said the outward appearance of the older ships is 
poor but the interiors are protected by dehumidification 
he said it would be a mistake to dispose of the vessels 
without any recognition as to us national security 
requirements 
martinez said his agency already has a successful program to 
exchange outmoded ships in the fleet for newer vessels that will 
upgrade the reserve fleet this program he said is a way of 
modernizing the reserve fleet 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said he was considering 
whether to ask that the government resume subsidies to the us 
maritime industry that were eliminated by the reagan 
administration the washington post reported today 
skinner in an interview with the newspaper said he would not 
make a recommendation however until his department has had a 
chance to study us shipping performance in operation desert

the 100000 us troops on duty in the middle 
east could begin sending letters home by simply signing their names 
on the envelopes under legislation moving rapidly through congress 
on a unanimous voice vote the senate on monday approved a 
measure by sen jesse helms rnc to provide free mail 
privileges last widely used during the vietnam war to american 
service personnel in saudi arabia and the persian gulf region 
similar legislation which has been endorsed by the bush 
administration was introduced in the house by rep william ford 
dmich chairman of the its post office and civil service 
committee ford said he hopes the house will vote on it early next 
week 
several lawmakers who visited with us troops in the region the 
past two weeks while congress was on vacation said a common 
complaint they heard was the inability to find stamps 
no one needs to be told that mail is the crucial link between 
the fighting man or woman and his family and friends back home 
he said they did not have stamps they could not get stamps and 
if by some chance stamps came their way they were soon stuck 
together by the humidity and the sweat 
the measure would apply only to mail sent from the middle east 
to the united states it would cover letters post cards and audio 
and video cassettes but not other items 
under current law that dates from world war i troops get free 
mailing privileges only during combat the postal service estimates 
the free mail privileges would cost taxpayers 500000 a month

with president saddam hussein of iraq 
vowing to hold on to kuwait policymakers in washington and moscow 
are studying what steps the united nations can take to tighten the 
noose around iraq 
there are a lot of ways you could rachet up the pressure in 
a series of small steps said a state department official speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in 
their helsinki summit communique said we are determined to see 
this aggression end and if the current steps fail to end it we 
are prepared to consider additional ones consistent with the un 
charter 
four days after the aug 2 invasion and occupation of kuwait 
the security council ordered a complete embargo on trade with iraq 
with the only goods exempted being medicines and medical equipment 
and in humanitarian circumstances foodstuffs 
on monday saddam tried to skirt the oil blockade by offering to 
give away crude oil to any third world country that sends tankers 
through the blockade to pick it up an indication baghdad is 
becoming desperate in its attempt to break out of international 
isolation 
but for any move saddam makes the security council can offer a 
countermove 
the un ambassador for the exiled kuwaiti government mohammad 
abulhasan on thursday proposed that the security council urgently 
consider blocking the air corridors seizing iraqi ships going 
to a formal naval blockade 
all those moves are possible under chapter seven of the un 
charter which goes so far as permitting demonstrations 
blockade and other operations by air sea or land forces of 
members of the united nations 
however a state department official speaking privately said 
monday that washington and moscow want to move cautiously the 
immediate concern is how do you make the current sanctions stick 
the soviets have said they would be willing to send troops to 
the persian gulf if there were a joint un military command and 
if they would be under the command of a soviet general 
gorbachev however said in helsinki that the soviet union is 
not now considering even sending ships to help enforce the embargo 
i dont see the point of doing that now he said and bush 
replied im not disappointed in that answer 
the state department official said there are a lot of ways 
you could rachet up the pressure through being more and more 
explicit about the resolutions already in place short of major 
chapter seven actions 
the thrust is to make sure other countries live up to these 
angles he said 
india bangladesh the philippines and other nations are already 
petitioning the security councils sanctions committee for 
permission to ship food into iraq and kuwait to feed the hundreds 
of thousands of their people who are still stranded there 
the councils sanctions committee has not yet determined that 
conditions in iraq or occupied kuwait are desperate enough to allow 
the import of food as a humanitarian step 
the kuwaiti ambassador and other diplomats have spoken of the 
possibility of having the security council impose an air blockade 
on iraq comparable to the current naval embargo enforced by the 
usled fleet in the persian gulf 
but the us official said you could say that shipment of 
cargo by air is already prohibited by the sanctions that is both a 
service and an export and clearly ruled out 
if countries neighboring iraq allow the use of their airspace 
for iraqi flights they would be facilitating transshipment 
which the us official said also would violate the embargo 
nations that violate a security council embargo may be subjected 
to sanctions themselves 
some american officials believe a formal council resolution 
endorsing an air embargo is not just unnecessary but could also 
lead to dangerous confrontations

severe cold or operating problems at oil 
refineries could force heating oil shortages this winter but 
otherwise adequate supplies are expected energy department 
officials say 
that assessment came monday during a congressional hearing at 
which several congressmen expressed concern about the outlook 
there now is a very small margin of safety said rep philip 
sharp dind chairman of the house energy and power subcommittee 
who suggested that the energy department tends to underestimate 
what can go wrong 
the reliance on foreign oil and lack of a domestic energy 
program by the bush administration was expected to come under 
renewed attack today as another house subcommittee looks into what 
measures should be to improve energy efficiency and conservation 
among those scheduled to testify before the house interior 
subcommittee on water power and offshore energy resources will be 
the sponsors of legislation that would require automakers to 
sharply increase the fuel economy of automobiles 
a bill that would call for a fleet average fuel economy 
requirement of 40 miles per gallon by the end of the decade could 
come up for senate floor action later this week according to 
senate sources 
on monday energy department officials cautiously predicted 
adequate fuel oil for this winter but said the situation could 
change for the worse if there is a severely cold winter or if 
operating problems develop at refineries which are have been going 
at nearmaximum 96 percent capacity further disruptions to mideast 
oil shipments also could cause shortages they said 
several congressmen complained the assessment was based on 
rosy assumptions and suggested that it provides little comfort 
to americans relying on oil to heat homes and factories 
calvin a kent head of the energy information administration 
told sharps subcommittee that us petroleum stocks appear 
adequate and that the shortfall of an estimated 1 million barrels 
of crude oil a day worldwide toward the end of the year can be 
handled as increased prices dampen demand 
kent said that refineries were operating at their maximum but 
that the capacity to refine crude both in the united states and 
elsewhere appears to be adequate and will remain so over the 
next three to six months 
nevertheless several other congressmen reiterated their call 
for president bush to release oil from the strategic petroleum 
reserve sharp said the president should consider at least a 
modest drawdown of the 590million barrel reserve to get 
confidence up and hopefully force prices down 
the bush administration has rejected use of the reserves unless 
there are significant supply interruptions 
rep terry bruce dill said he was nervous about the slim 
margin in refining capacity i fear we will run out of heating 
oil gasoline and jet fuel he said 
kent gave these assessments on the expected supply of various 
refined crude oil products

more than 100 million youngsters in the worlds poorest countries 
not receiving any formal schooling a report says 
there will be more than 1 billion illiterate adults by the end 
of the decade if the united states and other nations fail to 
address this third world education crisis said the report released 
by results educational fund an international citizen lobbying 
group 
the report precedes a world summit for children scheduled 
for sept 2930 at the united nations and calls on president bush 
to use his speech to the group to launch a new us foreign aid 
basic education initiative 
the main recommendation of the report is that the united states 
double within the next three years the annual amount of foreign aid 
going to basic education in evaluating americas current 
contribution the report found that less than 1 percent of us 
foreign aid goes for that purpose 
furthermore the report said us aid in basic education will 
decrease this year by 25 percent from 1295 million in fiscal 
year 1989 to 969 million in fiscal year 1990 a drop of more than 
32 million 
to reverse the decline the united states must increase the 
amount of its foreign aid going to basic education to at least 370 
million per year the group said just by shifting a small portion 
of current aid funds away from less productive spending such as 
military foreign aid would provide all the new funding needed the 
report added 
the report said that bush by launching the new initiative 
could prompt similar efforts by other donor nations and make a 
powerful contribution to making basic education and literacy for 
all a global reality 
right now there are more than 850 million adult illiterates 
with close to 98 percent of them in the developing nations and 
more than 60 percent of them women the report said women made up 
86 percent of the 154 million new adult illiterates from 1960 to 
1985 and more than 100 million primaryage children mostly girls 
currently are not enrolled in school 
thirtyfour countries have literacy rates of about 40 percent or 
less in 15 more at least onethird of all adults are illiterate 
the report said 
results education fund is a nonpartisan nonprofit 
organization most of the statistics were gathered during a march 
world conference in thailand and from information tallied by 
countries since 1946 officials said

neil bush is capable of repeating the conduct 
that harmed a collapsed colorado savings and loan by becoming a 
director at another thrift regulators have told an administrative 
law judge 
in written arguments submitted monday to judge daniel j 
davidson the office of thrift supervision opposed bushs request 
to dismiss the governments conflict of interest case against him 
the presidents son was an outside director of silverado 
banking savings and loan association a denver thrift that failed 
in late 1988 at a cost to taxpayers estimated at 1 billion 
the ots is seeking an order against bush which effectively would 
bar him from working for a bank or a savings and loan 
in his arguments filed late last month bush said there was no 
possibility that he could continue the alleged abuses since 
silverado already has been taken over by the government bush 35 
continued to deny any wrongdoing 
the thrift agency called that argument specious under the 
sampl bailout legislation enacted by congress last year regulators 
are supposed to stop harmful practices whether or not the practices 
would damage a specific institution if continued the ots said 
bush is perfectly capable of becoming a director at another 
institution and repeating his misconduct there the agencys 
brief said indeed throughout these proceedings he has evinced 
no willingness to consider that he has done anything wrong nor 
even any understanding that he ever had potential conflicts of 
interest 
in fact the reasons that moved a 2 billion institution to 
invite the then30yearold bush who had no experience in savings 
and loan operations to become a director are even more forceful 
today 
the ots said it is clear that bushs conduct was contrary to 
generally accepted standards of prudent operation and could cause 
harm to any financial institution if continued 
the regulators have accused bush of conflict of interest for not 
disclosing his business ties to two big silverado borrowers 
developers kenneth m good and bill l walters 
bush also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the 
federal deposit insurance corp is considering filing against him 
and other former silverado directors 
bush has been ordered to appear at a public hearing on sept 25 
in denver before davidson who will then make a recommendation to 
ots director timothy ryan 
they dont answer anything said bushs attorney james 
nesland referring to the latest ots brief 
nesland noted that the ots arguments dont address the fact that 
the proposed order against bush would be the first against an 
outside director after the institution has been closed 
nesland and bush continue to maintain that the regulators 
actions are politically motivated

the humiliating removal from power of 
kuwaits royal family has raised questions about how long other 
longtime rulers can survive in desert kingdoms carved out by the 
swords of their bedouin ancestors 
the iraqi takeover of kuwait five weeks ago showed the weakness 
of its emir and by extension of the other five conservative 
dynasties running the regions oilproducing states 
middle east observers say the winds of political change were 
already blowing and that iraqs seizure of kuwait has set in motion 
forces that will spell the end of the old order one way or 
another 
even the manner in which saudi arabia and other monarchies 
appealed for help as iraqi president saddam hussein gobbled up 
kuwait underlined their inherent weakness 
the invasion crystalized differences between arab states and 
split them into two camps proiraqi and prosaudi 
bahrain oman qatar the united arab emirates and above all 
saudi arabia had no choice but to line up behind kuwait 
after years of playing east against west they are now 
irrevocably linked to the west and the united states which is seen 
by most arabs as israels protector 
that puts them on a collision course with alien ideas and 
western political values including a belief in pluralistic 
democracy 
most people in the gulf expect some democratic changes after 
this and most governments are prepared to move but dont expect 
them to go the whole hog establishing parliaments and the like 
said brian pridham director of exeter universitys center for arab 
gulf studies in england 
these regimes wont even consider it and id hate to think 
what would happen if they did 
saddams actions also have sharpened the arab worlds focus on 
economic imbalances oil states that sit atop fabulous wealth 
while most states are deep in the red 
the kuwaiti revolution of aug 2 has sounded the alarm bell 
for other kuwaittype regimes it signaled a radical change of 
system a new political era in the arab gulf region the 
official iraqi news agency declared 
even if iraq is forced out of kuwait and the deposed alsabah 
family restored it would be the status quo ante 
it will not be possible for western democracies to reinstall a 
demonstrably nondemocratic system in kuwait said pridham 
there will certainly be changes some checks and balances 
some forms of democracy in an arab style which will vary from state 
to state he said 
democracy is rare in the arab world of 17 arab states 
including kuwait six are secular dictatorships and six are 
aboslute monarchies only five have introduced some minimal 
elements of pluralism 
political evolution in the arab world is slow neither islam nor 
arab nations have democratic traditions the six gulf kings are 
remnants of the emirs shieks and shahs who ruled throughout the 
region for centuries 
libya egypt iran yemen and iraq were all ruled by monarchs 
who have been killed or ousted by coups since 1952 all like the 
dynasties of the gulf had ruled with the support of britain and 
other colonial powers some were even handpicked in london 
but the gulf dynasties have hung on to power several can trace 
their roots back more than 300 years 
the emirs rule more or less benevolently some of the kingdoms 
observers say are among the best governed nations in the middle 
east 
thanks to oil revenue people enjoy a high standard of living 
and a measure of personal freedom the press may be censored but 
reporters are not hanged 
gulf sheiks wield power with an 18th century sense of noblesse 
oblige but no concessions to the democratic reforms sweeping much 
of the rest of the world they rule by edict forbid political 
parties and reject popular governing bodies 
blessed with huge oil reserves and small populations the rulers 
have shown enough social concern and material largesse to keep most 
subjects happy 
bahrain and kuwait experimented with popular assemblies but 
they didnt last long elections and parliaments in an arab context 
are often looked upon as foolhardy steps toward chaos 
just look at lebanon pridham said thats what they think 
democracy looks like in the middle east these regimes were 
horrified at the changes that swept eastern europe 
moreover recent elections in jordan and algeria saw islamic 
fundamentalists make significant gains a specter that haunts gulf 
rulers who have embraced many aspects of western life

negotiators are reporting the first 
breakthrough in drafting a compromise clean air bill with a 
tentative agreement between the house and senate on the control of 
smogcausing pollution from industry 
congressional sources emphasized however that there remained 
major differences that have yet to be resolved despite mounting 
time pressures congress plans to adjourn in early october 
the sources who demanded anonymity said staff negotiators 
agreed monday on measures to be taken against industry to control 
urban smog they opted for tougher house provisions that would 
require even small businesses to install new control equipment in 
areas with severe pollution 
the staff agreement was reached with the knowledge of lawmakers 
on the housesenate conference committee although committee 
members must still formally sign off on it said one source close 
to the negotiations 
the committee has tried since june to resolve differences in 
separate clean air bills that were approved by wide margins in the 
house and senate early this year 
the agreement on socalled title i which includes the 
industrial smogcontrol provisions and general air quality goals 
for communities was considered a major step forward in the 
discussions 
this is one of the major hurdles said daniel weiss who has 
followed the clean air debates for the sierra club an 
environmental group 
the massive and complex legislation calls for steep cuts in acid 
rain tougher emission controls on automobiles requirements that 
oil companies produce cleaner fuels and controls on toxic chemical 
releases the new requirements are predicted to cost industry 25 
billion a year when all take effect at the end of the decade 
the price tag has caused industry to intensify its lobbying 
against portions of the bill in view of skyrocketing oil prices and 
the increasing prospects of a recession 
the bush administration had opposed the stronger industrial smog 
controls tentatively agreed to monday saying that if small 
companies are required to install new control equipment the 
legislation will become too expensive environmentalists argued 
that small polluters account for nearly half of the smog in many 
urban areas 
under the agreement factories and businesses that release as 
little as 25 to 50 tons of pollution annually would be required to 
comply with new controls the senate bill had exempted facilities 
that release less than 100 tons of pollution per year 
meanwhile other controversial parts of the bill remain to be 
worked out including whether to provide financial assistance to 
workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution controls 
some lawmakers have also suggested that parts of the bill should 
be reexamined in light of the mideast crisis and the latest oil 
shocks 
we may have to begin to reassess what is realistic said 
democratic rep mike synar of oklahoma a leading oil state he 
suggested that some pollution control requirements on the petroleum 
industry and a mandate for cleaner fuels might have to be delayed 
nevertheless the agreement monday on industrial pollution 
represents the most significant progress yet in crafting a final 
bill 
the staff agreement also includes deadlines on when communities 
must comply with federal air quality requirements both the house 
and senate versions had similar deadlines giving most cities five 
to 15 years to bring their air into compliance with federal health 
standards los angeles was given 20 years 
but the agreement goes along with a house provision that would 
continue to require the federal government to impose air pollution 
control plans if cities fail to do so the senate version would 
have ended that federal requirement

congressional candidate eleanor holmes norton 
received an apology from her husband as he explained at a news 
conference that he simply procrastinated by not filing local 
tax returns since 1982 
it was always a situation where i said ill do this 
tomorrow edward norton an attorney told reporters monday 
im the villain in this and i apologize to my wife and the 
citizens 
mrs norton was flanked at the news conference by her husband 
and their two children 
this matter having been laid before the public means 
the voters of the district of columbia have all they need to decide 
whether i should be the next congresswoman mrs norton said on 
the eve of the citys democratic primary 
her husband said he simply procrastinated in not filing the 
joint tax forms his wife signed 
mrs norton said she even asked her husband are the taxes in 
and he said yes if i had knowingly done this why would i be 
running 
the candidates husband said he handles the familys finances 
however he did not reveal why he failed to inform his wife of the 
tax problem after she entered the race or why he did not file the 
forms in the first place the couple filed no local returns between 
1982 and 1989 
norton and her three opponents are vying for the nonvoting us 
house delegate seat held by walter fauntroy who is seeking the 
democratic nomination for mayor of district of columbia in todays 
primary 
the tax conflict has helped breath new life into the campaigns 
of nortons three opponents all of whom trailed her by 10 points 
or more in opinion polls taken before the controversy began 
local political observers suggest that veteran city councilwoman 
betty ann kane stands to gain most from nortons problems 
the washington post endorsed kane on monday after revealing that 
it scrapped a planned norton endorsement once the stories about her 
tax situation surfaced 
i am in this race to stay norton said at a campaign rally 
those that think they could chase this woman out of this race 
dont know a fighter when they see one

the bedouins of jordan hearing holy war in 
the wind pray to allah that a modern clash of wills will not make 
their ancient desert life vanish in the sands 
among the bedouins for centuries guided more by water and whim 
than by lines on a map any conflict threatens to restrict 
movement further threatening a way of life already in danger 
war will damage the whole world said mohammed salim 
squatting on his heels in a burlaprag tent near this city north of 
amman and the bedouin will suffer especially 
he wonders if he can go to saudi arabia or if he wants to 
under a climate of hostility over iraqs aug 2 seizure of kuwait 
he worries about market shortages in jordan 
far to the south near petra ali salim bedol watched the iraqi 
leader saddam hussein on a television set in the concrete block 
shelter given to him when bedouins were evicted from the 
2000yearold ruins now a major tourist attraction 
saddam is a great man he said but we do not want war no 
one can win if there is fighting we want only peace to take our 
goats and camels where we want and to live among arabs 
about 150000 bedouins live regularly in jordan under black 
goathair tents or in tumbledown hovels making up 5 percent of the 
total population some stay put but most pick up and roam at will 
another 9000 are nomads drifting back and forth toward saudi 
arabia whence bedouin tribes came when the hashemite royal family 
settled in jordan after world war i the family had left the hejaz 
saudi arabias arabic name 
despite the bedouins warlike reputation and their deep sense 
of honor most seem to reject saddams call to arms 
instead they follow events by radio newspapers passed from 
hand to hand or the occasional word from travelers they discuss 
the crisis endlessly around campfires at night 
they are hit hard by the crisis said rebecca salti who 
runs a save the children crafts project for bedouins in the desert 
east of amman many are afraid israel will attack and overrun 
their grazing lands 
bedouins once bolstered the political and military power base 
behind jordans king hussein camelmounted troops of the fabled 
arab legion enhanced their prestige and mystique 
but severe drought in the 1970s killed their animals and brought 
many bedouin families to the outskirts of towns army service paid 
high wages which inevitably meant changes in the old way of life 
today many families live precariously at the edge still 
fiercely loyal to the king but marginal to life in jordan 
a bedouin who would identify himself only as salam keeps his two 
wives 19 children two camels and small herd of goats in a tent 
compound on a barren hillside near zarqa 
with no income beyond what his animals produce he survives by 
the curious third world mathematics which defy all accounting if 
the crisis continues he said his delicate balance will tilt 
never mind he said for a poor man there is no fear in 
death a bedouin needs nothing we make clothes from our goats we 
have yogurt meat that is enough 
but his sons are in school and he thinks of the future they 
may be engineers or doctors by day and bedouins when they return at 
night he said he supports saddam but wants no war 
every country will be different if there is war he said 
we will not escape 
pressed for his full name he chuckled and said salam yachak 
el haya it wasnt his name in arabic it means salam loves life 
ali salim bedol is already suffering he once earned a modest 
living selling souvenirs to tourists at petra now the tourists 
are gone 
we will go to the desert if crisis comes he said there 
will always be a bedouin way 
his 17yearold son wearing a mickey mouse tshirt and 
captivated by the television looked doubtful

scores on the act college entrance exam were 
stagnant for the fifth straight year but blacks and other 
minorities continued to show gains 
the average composite score on the act the predominant college 
entrance test in 28 states mainly in the midwest and west was 206 
on a scale of 136 according to american college testing of iowa 
city iowa which administers the exam 
the average among students taking the test in 198990 was 
unchanged from the previous year and has shown virtually no 
movement in five years act said monday 
the 817096 students who took the exam last year were given a 
new version and therefore results were not directly comparable to 
previous years but act officials calculated that the 1990 scores 
and the 1989 averages were unchanged 
the scores offered school critics fresh evidence that nearly a 
decade of reform has brought little genuine improvement 
two weeks ago the college board which sponsors the sat the 
predominant college entrance test in the 22 other states reported 
scores on the verbal section had sunk to their lowest levels in a 
decade and math scores were unchanged for the fourth straight year 
act spokeswoman patricia farrant stressed in an interview that 
reform changes take a certain amount of time to show up in test 
scores 
act officials also insisted that the public should take heart 
from the fact that 45 percent of students taking the test in 1990 
took a solid core curriculum in high school compared with 36 
percent in 1987 
students taking at least four years of englishand three or more 
years of math social studies and science averaged 223 on the 
exam students taking less than that amount of coursework averaged 
191 
the act also found strong yeartoyear gains among virtually all 
minority groups 
blacks average scores rose 04 points to 170 mexican 
americans scored 183 up 02 american indians and alaskan natives 
averaged 180 up 05 
puerto ricans and other hispanics scored 193 unchanged from 
the previous year but up 03 from 1986 
by contrast white students averaged 212 or 01 lower than a 
year ago and down 03 from 1986 
the act is a fourpart exam testing english math reading and 
scientific reasoning 
both the sat and act are supposed to test a students readiness 
for college but the act is generally considered a broader test of 
high school mastery 
the new version of the act included new measures of writing 
ability new advanced math questions and a new reading test 
stressing reasoning skills the sat also is being revised for 1993 
act officials have consistently declined to release 
statebystate test data arguing it would invite inaccurate 
comparisons the college board issues a similar caution each year 
but nonetheless releases such data

alkharj saudi arabia ap waves of grain that will 
eventually provide us soldiers with bread spring from the same 
scorching reclaimed desert the troops were sent to protect 
saudi tomatoes on the other hand have it easier they are 
pampered in airconditioned greenhouses 
agriculture experts say saudi arabias drive to food 
selfsufficiency is being pushed even harder by the persian gulf 
crisis 
saudi arabia with annual rainfall averaging 4 inches produces 
all its own wheat and most of its milk and vegetables its an 
amazing thing that they have done said one western diplomat 
the kingdom is confident it can retain its position as the 
worlds sixth largest wheat exporter despite the loss of markets in 
iraq and kuwait the two countries bought 450000 tons annually in 
all saudi arabia exports 19 million tons to 42 countries 
it wont hurt said mohammed albasher deputy director 
general of the grain silos and flour mills organization to sell 
saudi wheat is not difficult 
the once desolate land that produced 3000 tons of wheat in 1975 
is expected to yield 32 million tons this year 
critics charge that the project hemorrhages cash and guzzles 
water from under the desert at a rate that will dry up the precious 
resource 
however government officials say the quantity of food grown and 
its distribution mean any iraqi attempt to attack one region or 
blockade food imports could not interrupt supplies 
we dont need to buy food in an emergency said albasher 
an extremely costly subsidy program underwrote the achievement 
interestfree loans up to 5 million or more are available to 
purchase land machinery and irrigation equipment 
the dairy herd you want is in holland no problem the 
government will pay for the shipping 
basically farming is a license to make money said another 
western diplomat speaking like his colleague on condition of 
anonymity 
the government buys all the wheat produced for 400 per ton from 
large corporate farms and 533 per ton from smaller producers that 
same ton sells for about 186 on world markets 
the wheat milled into flour goes at the bargainbasement rate of 
117 per ton caterers supplying the estimated 100000 us troops 
in saudi arabia buy their supplies from the government 
the 1990 budget allocated almost 2 billion for subsidies most 
of that for agriculture 
the government started to gently apply the brakes on subsidies 
during the oil price drop of the late 1980s it would like to see 
production gradually concentrate less on wheat and more on crops 
like flowers and vegetables government officials say 
but wheat still accounts for more than 65 percent of 
agricultural production 
while petrodollars were producing huge cash reserves everyone 
supported the agricultural development idea said omar s bagour a 
professor of economics at abdul aziz university in jiddah 
now we are asking if we should have done it on such a massive 
scale whether this was the best approach 
critics worry that the center pivot method of irrigation will 
suck underground aquifers dry within 15 years they think drip 
techniques would be preferable to the trundling sprinklers that 
allow so much to evaporate 
diplomats say the subsidy program will never be eliminated 
because it was a political rather than an economic decision from 
the beginning 
it helped spread the kingdoms wealth in the central najd 
region which had neither the oil deposits of the east nor the 
trade and annual income from the vast moslem pilgrimage to mecca in 
the west 
the program also keeps the countryside populated in a country 
bigger than western europe although most of the laborers like 
everywhere in saudi arabia are asians the subsidies have even 
tempted bedouins to settle down 
among other projects the subsidies spawned the largest dairy 
farm in the world at alkharj 54 miles south of the capital 
riyadh 
the cows are sprayed with a fine mist most of the day because 
duping them into thinking they are in some drizzly northern climate 
brings forth more milk 
the 115degree temperatures outside would curdle the milk within 
hours but a special cooling system on the hightech farm keeps the 
milk around 37 degrees as it is processed 
cucumbers and tomatoes grow in greenhouses that cover more than 
an acre each the windows are whitewashed and air conditioners 
blow cool air crop yields are about three times what they were in 
the fields 
the agriculture projects are widely viewed as a miracle in the 
kingdom 
flying overhead the harsh landscape is suddenly interrupted by 
mile after mile of green 
the sight is known to be a special favorite of the king 
said one diplomat hes made the desert bloom at a price 
but its a price he can afford so why not

with aid finally arriving and 
fewer people crossing the iraqi border officials say they may be 
turning a corner in this desolate refugee camp at least for now 
tens of thousands of destitute asians and egyptians are still 
stuck in baking dusty refugee camps throughout jordan with an 
estimated 500000 reported waiting to cross the border from iraq 
but after nearly three weeks of dealing with overwhelming 
numbers officials at the largest and most notorious of three 
border camps said monday that the number of residents had tapered 
off 
about 30000 were at shaalan i on monday compared with 45000 
late last week and jordanian officials say the ratio of arrivals 
to departures from the border area has improved 
hundreds of thousands of refugees have crossed the iraqjordan 
border at the nearby ruweishid checkpoint since saddam husseins 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 and more than 110000 are stranded 
in jordan as attempts are made to get them transportation home 
most have been forced to make do in shaalan i and the two other 
squalid camps between the jordanian and iraqi checkpoints they 
wait up to two weeks to return to the home countries they left to 
seek a better life in kuwait 
the international organization for migration said in geneva on 
monday there are still 500000 foreigners who want to leave iraq 
so the refugee situation in jordan could rapidly deteriorate with a 
massive influx 
still relief officials have had a respite from the chaos of 
those first weeks 
it is five or six times better than before said dr almadin 
azim a physician at shaalan i in the beginning youre not 
ready to do all the things they ask of you 
azim said he is still without medicines to treat the 60 to 70 
scorpion stings that occur each night there is also a shortage of 
antibiotics for those allergic to penicillin 
we need blankets tents milk said kriam alhadid the red 
crescent official in charge at the camp all the world must help 
us 
even more crucial is transportation most of the refugees are 
stuck where they are because officials simply dont have enough 
vehicles to move them 
the international organization for migration said the 
situation looks more optimistic a week after the start of an 
airlift and a worldwide appeal for aid 
but it said the aid was still insufficient 
pledged contributions of 30 million have enabled the agency to 
schedule 107 flights that would repatriate more than 31500 
stranded people over the next 10 days it said 
on monday more than 10000 people had crossed the border into 
jordan by 6 pm and 8000 people had left the official news 
agency petra said 
those figures compared favorably with last week when arrivals 
far outnumbered departures 
alhaddid said there have been three births and one death from 
natural causes since the camp opened almost three weeks ago 
there were noticeably fewer people in the camp monday than last 
week 
many of their makeshift tents had been replaced by a sea of 
aquacolored plastic water bottles and other debris mingling with 
the ochre dust stirred up by motor vehicles and desert whirlwinds 
several thousand had been moved down the road to a camp called 
rahima arabic for mercy 
tents were set up there for 5000 to 6000 people and more 
shelters were en route said jim nuttal coordinator for save the 
children 
nuttal said aid from the jordanian government had improved 
right now its enough weve got enough water everybodys 
being fed he said 
at azraq 125 miles to the southwest toward amman a new camp is 
being erected to replace another that was moved because it 
threatened the capitals water supply 
workers sweated to complete a tent city there with a 
highpressure water pipe connected to the ammanazraq line it will 
be a temporary home to 30000 people many of whom now are at 
ruweishid 
this is a camp there its just a gathering of people said 
yves etienne a red cross engineer supervising construction of a 
water tank 
and how long would the refugees be housed at azraq he was asked 
only allah knows he answered

arab foreign ministers and senior officials 
are moving the arab leagues headquarters from tunisia to cairo a 
move that signals a deepening of existing regional divisions 
the decision was approved monday by 12 of the leagues 21 
members the same majority that at an arab summit earlier this 
month condemned iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iraq and its supporters including the palestine liberation 
organization boycotted mondays meeting 
iraq said it would not abide by the decision indicating a 
further split between baghdad and its supporters and egypt and the 
11 arab states that back the transfer 
i have faith that the return of the headquarters to its site 
in cairo is necessary to maintain the role and essence of the arab 
league egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid said in his 
message opening the meeting 
egypt will cooperate and coordinate with all arab friends and 
will continue the effort to keep the arab league a home for all 
arabs at all times based on its conviction that the league is 
above all passing conflicts among the arab states 
the message was read by osama elbaz the deputy foreign 
minister abdelmeguid was unable to attend the session because of 
minor injuries suffered during a car crash friday 
the league said its major departments would move by oct 31 from 
the tunisian capital of tunis to its old site in cairo it said 
other departments should be moved from tunis to cairo by dec 31 
announcement of the relocation is a formality to complement a 
decision made in march in tunis at a regular meeting of the arab 
league council 
the league headquarters was transfered from cairo to the 
tunisian capital in 1979 in retaliation for egypts signing of the 
camp david peace treaty with israel 
egypts membership in the arab league was reinstated in 1989 
about a year after most arab counties resumed diplomatic ties with 
cairo relations had been severed in reaction to camp david 
the arab leagues attempt to project arab unity was shattered 
after iraqs invasion of kuwait egypt morocco and syria sent 
troops to saudi arabia to help defend it against possible iraqi 
attack and most persian gulf nations condemned the seizure of 
oilrich kuwait 
but other nations including neighboring jordan and the plo did 
not join the criticism proiraqi demonstrations have been held in 
yemen tunisia mauritania libya jordan and the israelioccupied 
territories 
the nine arab states or organizations that boycotted mondays 
meeting were algeria iraq jordan libya mauritania the plo

the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen in 
tokyo tuesday while share prices fell in moderate trading 
the dollar closed at 13985 yen 042 yen above mondays finish 
after opening at 14005 yen the us currency ranged between 
13955 and 14025 yen 
the tokyo stock exchanges 225issue nikkei stock average fell 
47624 points or 190 percent to 2460466 an estimated 400 
million shares were traded on the markets first section on 
monday the nikkei index advanced 111883 points in its sixth 
largest daily gain 
on the bond market the yield of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds jumped to 8365 percent from mondays 
close of 8225 percent their price fell to 8201 from 8257 
traders said the nikkei index slid mostly due to the yens fall 
against the dollar as well as a fall in the price of government 
bonds 
first was the yen exchange rate second bonds got cheaper 
said yoshiro inoue an analyst at nomura securities 
profittaking after mondays big gain and the overnight rise in 
oil prices also were factors in the falling stock market traders 
said 
on the currency market the us unit regained strength in tokyo 
as japanese investors started selling the yen to make up their 
oversold dollar positions following recent substantial selling 
said akiko baba a customer dealer with the bank of tokyo 
she noted the overnight hike in oil prices in new york also 
encouraged the dollars strength but added the dollars 
increase is just a temporary move as part of technical adjustments 
because there are more negative elements to encourage dollar 
selling than buying 
ms baba said there is a growing market expectation that the 
us federal reserve board will ease its monetary policy to cope 
with a slowdown in the us economy a factor that would encourage 
dollar selling

five more legislators and a former 
representative who is now a judge have been implicated in a 
statehouse scandal in which three of five lawmakers previously 
indicted have pleaded guilty to selling their votes 
us attorney bart daniel filed court papers monday that said 
the six conspired to obtain money for their votes on a bill that 
would legalize dog and horse racing the bill was never put to a 
final vote 
none of the six has been charged although they have 
acknowledged being questioned by the fbi in connection with the 
16month investigation 
all six are black some blacks including democratic 
gubernatorial nominee theo mitchell have questioned why so many 
blacks have been implicated 
certainly its a disproportionate number of black legislators 
that were targeted he said last month nineteen of the 
legislatures 170 members are black four of the five lawmakers 
indicted in august are white 
the us attorney has strongly denied any racial motivation 
during the investigation fbi agents videotaped lawmakers taking 
cash from lobbyist ron cobb a former house member working 
undercover for the fbi 
named as conspirators monday were democratic reps larry 
blanding of sumter james faber of eastover ennis fant of 
greenville bj gordon of kingstree and frank mcbride of 
columbia also named was circuit judge tee ferguson a former 
democratic house member from spartanburg he was suspended from 
hearing cases

springs pleaded guilty to a bribery charge last week former 
reps robert brown dmarion and danny winstead rcharleston 
entered similar pleas 
no sentencing date has been set 
lee faces up to 20 years in prison as do brown and robert kohn 
a republican from charleston who has pleaded innocent winstead 
faces 30 years 
the fifth lawmaker indicted last month luther taylor a 
democrat from columbia faces 120 years 
the filings monday came in response to a request by taylors 
attorney that prosecutors list the unidentified conspirators 
referred to in the indictment against him 
in the papers daniel also said taylor took 2800 from cobb in 
1988 and 1989 for voting to uphold a 28 million computer contract 
won by national advance system with clemson university the final 
payment of 300 was filmed by the fbi the papers said 
daniel said taylor is on videotape saying that payment of 
legislators has been businessasusual for years taylor has not 
been charged in the computer case but daniel argued that evidence 
about the case should be admitted in court

bitter memories linger but the scars of tank 
treads and bullet holes have been patched up as beijing residents 
await the asian games 
china remains as always the center of its own universe 
daily news broadcasts bring alarming reports from the persian 
gulf that barely seem to touch this city of 10 million there is no 
stock market to plummet no troops are being sent 
visitors to beijing find the city at its best old apartment 
blocks and courtyard houses facing the streets have been plastered 
over and painted 
pink rose bushes and shrubs have been planted in preparation for 
the sept 22oct 7 asian games 
crimson banners proclaim warm welcome to our guests 
beijing citizens have been instructed to kill pet and stray dogs 
to reduce the risk of rabies and keep the city clean 
sternlooking men and women in yellow hats and red armbands are 
stationed on street corners for bicycle traffic control and to 
discourage littering and spitting a prevalent habit in this dusty 
city with the threat of 5 yuan 1 fines 
there are few physical reminders of the violence of the spring 
of 1989 when hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed as the 
military cleared central beijing of prodemocracy demonstrators 
a year ago the city was still subdued and foreign tourists 
scarce soldiers armed with automatic rifles stood ominously at 
major intersections and in the diplomatic quarters 
the rifles have disappeared this year beijings posh 
international hotels are filling up with foreign business 
executives and tourists 
beijing in late summer seems a city suspended in time 
no one expects anything to happen no top leaders are likely 
to drop from favor or die until the asian games are well out of the 
way said one western diplomat 
but the appearance of calm on twilight sidewalks crowded with 
card players and watermelon vendors masks deep political 
undercurrents 
video surveillance cameras stare down on evening strollers 
discouraging all but the most businesslike contacts between 
foreigners and chinese 
you should never quote a chinese person by name one chinese 
journalist told a western reporter its just too dangerous for 
them 
intellectuals ask foreign friends to call from public phones or 
to just drop in to help skirt surveillance 
things look like they have improved said one researcher 
but for many of us they are still pretty bad 
despite a few gestures aimed at restoring its international 
image such as lifting martial law in beijing and allowing 
dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi to leave his yearlong refuge 
in the us embassy to travel abroad the political noose is still 
tight 
the media is tightly controlled writers and artists must have 
a firm belief that only socialism can save china 
propaganda official he jingzhi said in a recent speech 
a steady stream of local reports blames rising crime rates and 
materialism on unhealthy western influences 
the communist party refuses to budge from oneparty rule 
although leaders acknowledge that they must stem widespread 
corruption and improve living conditions to reclaim public support 
the asian games aimed so clearly at repairing chinas 
tarnished image abroad appear to have done little to enhance the 
governments image at home 
a resident of one crumbling compound hidden by a fancy new gray 
plaster wall called the renovation a sham 
longtime foreign residents of beijing say the leaderships 
obsession with the asian games has done little to win public 
support among residents who were asked to make contributions to 
the 53 million fund needed to stage the games 
we have a bad government said one chinese salesman were 
poor but they took even more money away from us to pay for the 
asian games it doesnt do us any good 
the government has tightened security in the city to gird 
against possible terrorist attacks or protests by students and 
workers seeking to take advantage of the large foreign presence 
during the asian games 
some taxi drivers said they had stopped working nights because 
they didnt like being stopped by police 
few observers expect the public memories of last years 
violence still sharp to be defiant 
but glimmers of hope remain 
chinese people are very patient they know that their 
experiences helped the revolutions in eastern europe and they are 
just waiting to see what will happen next said one intellectual 
theres alot of suspense said one young chinese man you 
just have to wait and see in a way its exciting

the city council in this chicago suburb 
has approved the nations first tax on college tuition voting to 
charge students at northwestern university and three other schools 
up to 60 a year 
mayor joan barr immediately said she will veto the measure and 
northwestern threatened to take the city to court 
i do not believe evanston should be the very first community 
in the united states to tax education the mayor said evanston 
has always taken pride in its educational excellence 
the measure was approved 108 monday night to make up for the 
property taxes from which the schools are exempt and to give tax 
relief to homeowners who saw higher bills in this community of 
73000 because of reassessment last year 
the council could override a veto by a twothirds vote 
the tax of 15 per semester or per quarter depending on how 
the schools academic year is set up would generate an estimated 
500000 a year toward the citys budget which totaled 773 
million in 199091 officials said 
the measure would apply to three other schools kendall 
college garrett evangelical theological seminary and 
seaburywestern theological seminary 
but the debate monday centered on northwestern and its 
unwillingness to pay the city for police and fire protection the 
university has its own security force but occasionally asks for 
assistance from evanston police 
all we are asking for is a basic principle and that is a fair 
share said alderman jack korshak who proposed the measure 
five dollars a month each of you can judge for yourself the 
extent to which this represents an insuperable burden to a 
student 
university president arnold weber argued northwestern students 
couldnt handle the extra 60 because more than half already 
receive extensive financial aid most of the schools nearly 10500 
students are undergraduates who pay tuition of 13725 a year 
weber called the tax antieducation and antibusiness 
and said it would destroy the relationship between the city and its 
educational institutions northwestern which owns 242 of the 5400 
acres in the community has said it is typical for such 
institutions to be exempt from property taxes 
we have focused on northwestern the big the bad and 
apparently the ugly said alderman david nelson who voted 
against the tax there are apparently going to be others caught 
up in the maelstrom 
northwestern officials have promised a court fight they have 
pointed out that the school brings about 500000 visitors a year to 
the city pumps millions of dollars into the local economy and adds 
many cultural advantages 
no other us city has a tuition tax said sheldon e steinbach 
vice president and general counsel of the american council on 
education in washington the council represents 1500 colleges and 
universities nationwide 
bob goritz an evanston resident and a lawyer argued the tax 
would not stand up in court 
no matter what verbiage you put on the measure its a tax on 
the occupation of being a student he said all youre going to 
buy yourself is about five years of litigation that will result in 
this being overturned

the chilean exporters association is accusing 
the us food and drug administration of contaminating two chilean 
grapes with cyanide and setting off a public health scare in march 
1989 
a report issued by the association in washington and santiago 
chile concluded that based on scientific studies the grapes 
could not have been tampered with in chile or at the port of 
philadelphia where the poisoned grapes were found 
the grapes were contaminated at the fda laboratory in 
philadelphia the report said the manner in which the 
contamination took place could have been accidental or 
intentional 
fda officials have said repeatedly that they believe the grapes 
were poisoned in chile before the ship left on its twoweek voyage 
to the united states 
of the reports conclusion fda spokesman bill grigg said we 
think thats preposterous 
the fda went looking for the grapes after the us embassy in 
santiago received an anonymous telephone threat march 2 1989 
after it found the two tainted grapes the fda urged that all 
chilean fruit be removed from us markets while more tests 
continued 
the association estimated the fdas action cost the chileans 
more than 330 million as more than 6 million cases of fruit in the 
united states were destroyed 
the association said research at the university of california at 
davis showed that if the two grapes had been contaminated with 
cyanide other grapes in the same case also would have contained 
the poison however none was found the fda has said 
the studies also showed that because cyanide was found at such 
high levels it would have to have been introduced in the grapes 
more recently than two weeks before when the ship was in chile 
the report said

a cuban exile who had been a fugitive for 12 
years has pleaded guilty to conspiring to murder former chilean 
ambassador orlando letelier by helping bomb the exdiplomats car 
jose dionisio suarez esquivel a member of the cuban nationalist 
movement admitted in federal court monday that he gave a blasting 
cap to former chilean intelligence agent michael v townley who 
pleaded guilty to building the bomb that killed letelier and an 
associate on sept 21 1976 
letelier an outspoken critic of the rightwing military 
government of gen augusto pinochet and the associate ronni 
moffitt died after the bomb exploded beneath leteliers car on 
embassy row 
letelier had been his countrys ambassador to washington from 
1971 to 1973 he also served briefly as foreign minister in the 
leftist government of president salvador allende who died in a 
bloody military coup that overthrew his government in 1973 
two top military officials including the head of the chilean 
intelligence agency dina have been charged with participating in 
the murder but the chilean government which returned to civilian 
control earlier this year has refused to extradite the officials 
pinochet remains head of the chilean army and military courts 
retain jurisdiction over the two officials gen juan manuel 
contreras sepulveda and retired lt col pedro espinoza bravo the 
former head of dina 
under the deal approved by us district judge aubrey e 
robinson jr suarez 51 who was arrested april 11 in st 
petersburg fla cannot be sentenced to more than 12 years in 
prison even though the charge to which he pleaded guilty carries a 
maximum life sentence 
prosecutors also agreed not to prosecute his wife elizabeth 
gongora suarez for concealing a fugitive from authorities 
suarez also admitted that he townley and others went to 
leteliers residence two days before the bombing knowing that 
townley was to place an explosive device on the former diplomats 
car 
townley an americanborn dina agent pleaded guilty in 1978 to 
building the bomb and putting it beneath leteliers car he served 
a 40month prison term and has cooperated with the governments 
investigation 
former chilean army maj armando fernandez larios defected in 
1987 and pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the 
conspiracy fernandez implicated his superiors in dina and pinochet 
in the coverup of the chilean militarys involvement in the killing 
fernandez and townley had been expected to testify against 
suarez who was scheduled to go to trial next week the government 
agreed to drop four other charges against suarez as part of the 
deal 
investigators believe that suarez may have detonated the bomb 
with a remote electronics device from a car that he and virgilio 
paz romero still a fugitive used to follow letelier said a 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
defense attorney paul goldberger said suarezs primary 
motivation for pleading guilty was to help his wife avoid 
prosecution hes got a wife and a baby the lawyer said 
if suarez is sentenced to 12 years he would be eligible for 
release after serving nine years of the prison term goldberger 
said 
us attorney jay b stephens said that suarez would have been 
eligible for parole after 10 years even if he had received a life 
sentence 
we believe this is a substantial disposition given his 
relative degree of culpability stephens said 
washington lawyer e lawrence barcella who investigated the 
case as a federal prosecutor praised the plea bargain 
while i think they had a good case and i think they would 
have prevailed it would have been a very difficult effort given

former president ronald reagan had a light 
schedule in berlin today a day before he is to fulfill a dream of 
walking through the nowcrumbling berlin wall 
reagan 79 and his wife nancy arrived just after midnight 
monday to start a 10day trip through germany poland the soviet 
union and italy 
the berliner morgenpost daily greeted the reagans with a story 
recounting his speech june 12 1987 before the wall where he 
challenged soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to open this 
gate tear down this wall 
the wall now has been open since last november when the 
communists then ruling east germany in a desperate attempt to 
retain power granted freedom of travel to its citizens the 
communists have lost all power and the two germanys are to unite 
into one country on oct 3 
reagan has a busy schedule wednesday when he is to walk through 
the landmark brandenburg gate in the former area of the wall and 
meet with democratically elected officials in east berlin

president mikhail s gorbachev went before 
parliament today and rejected the moderate economic plan his prime 
minister had just presented to the body instead endorsing a more 
radical program 
the stunning statement reflected dwindling confidence in prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov and put gorbachev closer to the 
position of radical reformers such as boris n yeltsin 
yeltsin the russian republic president asked the republics 
parliament last week to approve a radical reform plan drafted by 
stanislav shatalin a gorbachev aide 
shatalins plan would transfer enormous authority from 
parliament to the legislatures of the republics which would then 
have the power to scrap centralized economic planning introduce 
market mechanisms and legalize private property 
gorbachev rejected ryzhkovs plan but said elements of it would 
be combined with shatalins plan he said the shatalin program 
appeals more to him because it integrates the ideas of 
constituent republics 
if there is a real plan to stabilize finances money 
circulation the ruble and the market then we should adopt the 
shatalin idea gorbachev said we should try and work out a 
single document and we are nearing it 
gorbachevs remarks were reported by the state news agency tass 
he has avoided explicitly expressing a lack of confidence in 
ryzhkov a close ally but his statements sparked new speculation 
that ryzhkov would step down soon 
gorbachev said he would present a plan on wednesday that would 
be very close to the more radical plan proposed earlier by yeltsin 
a commission with members appointed by the two men has been trying 
to draft a common document for several weeks 
ryzhkovs speech drew fire from lawmakers in the national 
legislature and gorbachev responded with a warning against 
shaking up all the political institutions in the country tass 
said 
this is unacceptable in this case we shall bury everything 
we have achieved over these five years said gorbachev who 
became general secretary of the soviet communist party in 1985 
no prime minister in 73 years of soviet history has been forced 
to resign because parliament refused to endorse his program 
however the communist party leader traditionally has been able to 
force the retirement of the head of government 
several russian parliamentarians rose to urge the body to call 
for ryzhkov to step down but yeltsin urged caution and stressed 
first the adoption of the shatalin plan by the legisatures of the 
national and the republic governments 
ryzhkovs proposal today differed little from one tossed back at 
him for reworking last spring 
there is no principal difference its centralized leadership 
centralized prices its not possible to sell land said estonian 
economist and legislator siim kallas 
leningrad mayor and national legislator anatoly sobchak on 
monday called for a vote of noconfidence in ryzhkov charging he 
was unable to offer a realistic solution to the countrys economic 
crisis 
the impasse increases the forces pulling the soviet union apart 
with 13 of the 15 republics already pressing for independence or 
sovereignty 
shatalin said he expected his plan to be approved by the russian 
parliament since russia is the largest republic by far with three 
quarters of the soviet unions land and half its population 
conflicting decisions by the russian and soviet governments would 
be impossible to ignore 
shatalin in an interview with the interfax news agency said 
the central government would not support his plan because it would 
undercut kremlin power 
there has never been a government in the entire world that 
would voluntarily give up power and land he said 
the plan also calls for superiority of republics laws over 
national ones 
ryzkhov sharply criticized the shatalin plan saying it would 
lower the living standard by 30 percent and force one of every four 
collective farms into bankruptcy 
he said only 25 percent of basic consumer products would remain 
pricecontrolled under the shatalin plan 
soviet studies have found that less than 10 percent of 2000 
everyday products are readily available in stores 
the ryzhkov plan called for a much slower transition to a market 
economy the latest version drops a controversial proposal to 
double and triple the price of food but retains drastic price 
increases set for jan 1 for expensive consumer goods like 
televisions radios and refrigerators 
ryzkkov said the economic situation was worsening rapidly he 
said western banks were growing reluctant to lend more hard 
currency to the soviet union

firefighters working in rugged 
terrain today battled a brush fire apparently started by target 
shooters that damaged five milliondollar homes and forced the 
evacuation of about 175 people 
aided by parched undergrowth and stiff coastal winds the blaze 
had charred more than 2640 acres and was 35 percent contained by 
early today the california department of forestry reported 
the fire which began about noon monday is believed to have 
been started by target shooters at an illegal shooting site off a 
back road said department spokeswoman audrey hagen a fire can 
start when a bullet hits a rock and sets off a spark that ignites 
dry brush the department said 
it quickly burned across canyons and hillsides about 30 miles 
north of downtown san diego forcing overnight evacuations of homes 
south of escondido volunteers brought trailers to help evacuate 
about 50 horses and other animals 
i have never seen a fire going down a hill so fast ruth 
preston said as she watched firefighters protecting her hilltop 
home they told us they didnt think the fire would reach us 
that we didnt have anything to worry about but then the fire 
chief told us there was a wall of fire coming up and we that we had 
to get out of there 
forestry department spokeswoman carol stein said the blaze still 
threatened barns sheds and maybe some homes but officials 
estimated the fire would be contained by evening and residents were 
expected to be allowed back today 
more than 600 firefighters on the ground including inmates set 
back fires and bulldozed fire breaks to prevent the blaze from 
reaching more populated areas and interstate 15 
three helicopters and six air tankers dropped water and 
retardant until the aircraft were grounded for the night 
the difficulties of fighting this were the terrain was 
extremely steep and inaccessible and it had very heavy fuel 
firefighter chris fall said this particular area had not burned 
in 20 or 30 years and the brush was 6 feet thick 
four homes sustained scorched roofs or other minor damage and 
the roof of a fifth home collapsed stein said three vehicles also 
were burned 
the lone reported injury was to a firefighter who suffered a 
knee injury officials said 
trish demopoulos who also had to flee her hilltop home said 
living in this area we know theres always fire hazards but you 
think it will happen to everybody else not you this brings it 
pretty close to reality

got a cellular phone dude better check it in at 
the counter 
theaters restaurants and other businesses are increasingly 
banning the portable phones as customers complain of the impolite 
user 
they say they need them suddenly everyones a doctor said 
manager fredd selgas of the coconut grove playhouse where patrons 
are urged to check their phones at the door 
complaints about people taking calls in the middle of movies led 
to a ban on the phones at all 18 florida theaters owned by wometco 
lets face it said wometco general manager john wray 
youre in the middle of a tense love scene and someones phone 
rings and a guy says hi sweetheart howre you doing 
we feel that its a disturbing effect to the patrons and as a 
courtesy they should not bring their phones in 
with the use of cellular phones increasing cities may take 
legislative action in the florida statehouse the phones are 
banned from senate and house floors as well as in the public 
galleries above 
people who do not carry cellular phones dont like them in 
public places said sheldon brown a manager at bellsouth mobility 
but people who carry them disagree 
if your livelihood depends on that telephone and thats how 
you support your family understandably you want to take that phone 
with you everywhere you go said bellsouth marketing director 
leslie girolamo 
but dealing with them is another matter and the problem in the 
future could get out of hand 
it could be like smoking theyll have a phone section and a 
nonphone section said alfonso blanco manager of a cellular 
phone store

a man sent to prison for setting fire 
to his son in 1983 is back behind bars today on charges of 
violating his parole authorities said 
charles rothenberg 50 allegedly slipped away from a parole 
agent who had been following him monday morning he was in san 
quentin prison by dinner 
he will receive a hearing within 60 days on the alleged 
violation and could get up to year in prison said corrections 
department spokesman tipton kindel 
rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder for pouring 
kerosene over his son david and setting him afire in a buena park 
motel room during a dispute with his estranged wife in new york 
the boy then 6 was rescued by motel guests but was burned over 
90 percent of his body he was severely disfigured 
rothenberg served six years and five months of his 13year 
sentence before being released on three years parole in january 
the same conviction today could bring a life sentence 
the parolee who described himself as the mostwatched man in 
america after he left prison always had at least one parole 
officer watching him he had been living in alameda county the 
exact location was not revealed 
california officials called the parole the most restrictive in 
state history and said it costs taxpayers 18000 a month besides 
the 24houraday surveillance it also includes strict rules on 
travel weekly psychiatric counseling and other requirements 
on monday rothenberg went into an doughnut shop and apparently 
snuck out through a window or back door kindel said 
rothenberg telephoned another agent to say he would go to a 
scheduled job interview he was taken into custody when he arrived 
there 
hes always been under surveillance and he knows that its 
part of the program kindel said up to this point hed been 
doing what he was supposed to do hed been abiding by the rules 
keeping a low profile and trying to obtain employment 
rothenbergs prosecutor wasnt surprised to see him back in 
prison 
it was predictable with rothenberg orange county deputy 
district attorney tom avdeef said it was my feeling that he 
wouldnt make parole that he would violate it in some fashion 
because of his background 
david rothenberg who lives with his mother and stepfather in 
orange county said just before his father was paroled that he kept 
a bb gun by his bed id shoot his eye out if he ever came over 
id blind him he said

authorities say more than 500 pieces of 
evidence collected in the killings of five college students mostly 
involve a single suspect and genetic testing is under way on blood 
and semen 
steve platt head of the florida department of law enforcements 
jacksonville crime lab indicated monday that police were 
investigating whether the slayings involved sexual assault he 
refused to say whether the blood and semen were taken from the 
crime scenes or from 18yearold edward lewis humphrey 
humphrey is one of eight suspects but hes the one weve 
received the most information about gainesville police 
spokeswoman sadie darnell said i think thats why early on hes 
become the focus rightly or wrongly we still dont know yet 
only about half the evidence has been processed at the crime 
lab where 17 technicians are working full time on the case platt 
said 
its a slow painstaking effort he said 
genetic testing is a technique first used in courtrooms in 1986 
to identify people by using deoxyribonucleic acid the unique dna 
code everyone has duplicated in their body tissue bone hair roots 
and various bodily fluids 
a congressional study last month found that it is reliable 
courtroom evidence if proper standards are followed in the tricky 
lab tests done to match dna taken from a person or a crime scene 
were not going to let time dictate this investigation said 
lt spencer mann spokesman for the alachua county sheriffs 
department we have to be right we cant guess we cant take 
chances 
police repeated warnings that the killer may still be on the 
loose and said no arrests are imminent 
humphrey remains jailed on 11 million bond in the aug 30 
beating of his grandmother an october 1988 armed burglary and 
attempted rape in indian river county and an aug 25 assault on 
two male university of florida students 
investigators have said a shrewd and methodical killer late last 
month stabbed four young women and one young man who were students 
in this college town the killer reportedly arranged body parts at 
the slaying scene for maximum shock value 
at the students apartments investigators finished their 
searches over the weekend and landlords were preparing to find new 
tenants 
well renovate and then well rent it out said carol hyde 
manager of the gatorwood apartments where the bodies of manny 
taboada and tracy paules both 23 were found aug 28 theres 
still blood on the walls 
ms hyde said she would tell prospective tenants about the 
gruesome murders but johanna yarborough manager of the apartments 
where the mutilated nude bodies of christina powell 17 and sonya 
larson 18 were found aug 26 said if somebody asks ill tell 
them but its not like im going to say oh by the way two 
girls were murdered here 
monday also marked the last day students could drop classes 
administrators calculated 500 left the university as a result of 
the killings but interim registrar steve pritz said some students 
regretted their decision and want to come back for spring semester

barbara bush says if saddam hussein is 
concerned about iraqs children he should pull his troops out of 
kuwait and end the crisis threatening to plunge the region in war 
asked monday what she would tell the iraqi president if she had 
the chance the first lady said id rather send a message to our 
soldiers and tell them we want them home and that were doing 
everything we can for peace 
hussein has charged that the united nations embargo is 
jeopardizing the lives of children in his country and throughout 
the region 
thats not whats killing the children of kuwait or iraq or 
egypt or anyplace else mrs bush said he went into a country 
and attacked it we cant forget that 
in a voice fraught with emotion she said in an interview i 
hope hell take into consideration these children 
mrs bush said the persian gulf situation is the worst crisis 
her husband has faced in his 20 months in office but he was 
bearing it well 
i dont think its ever off his mind but does he dwell on it 
no she said he does what he can hes got a wonderful 
wonderful disposition 
she said she was not at all bothered by criticism of bushs 
proceeding with his maine vacation while american servicemen were 
being dispatched to the saudi arabia because i knew he was 
working 
mrs bush said she has not been offering the president advice on 
the gulf crisis 
i think wives in my case under our system do very well to 
aid and comfort their husband and keep trying to make life as 
peaceful as you can at home not needle not give suggestions 
she said 
she charged that her son neil has been singled out for 
scrutiny in the silverado savings and loan scandal only because he 
is the presidents son 
its darn unfair that theyre only doing it to hurt george 
bush and they have succeeded she said their 35yearold son 
is a former outside director of the denver thrift which collapsed 
costing taxpayers 1 billion 
mrs bush revealed that millie her 3yearold english springer 
spaniel which had been hobbling earlier this year has lupus but 
shes in complete remission 
millies rambunctious pup ranger has taken up permanent 
residence in the white house having outgrown the suburban yard of 
son marvin bush and family 
millie has not been supplanted insisted mrs bush patting 
the dog throughout the interview 
the dog is the star of a new astoldto autobiography about 
life in the white house mrs bush the ghost writer is devoting 
the royalties from millies book to her literacy foundation 
which just last week awarded 500000 in grants 
i think its very easy reading she said of the 1795 hard 
cover book replete with scores of pictures of millie with her 
pups the president britains queen elizabeth ii and other vips 
asked if she expected bush to seek reelection in 1992 the 
first lady said i dont doubt that hell run again but if he 
didnt i certainly wouldnt be surprised nor would i be 
frightfully disappointed 
twelve years is a long time she said counting his eight 
years as vice president and four as president she added with a 
laugh im sort of looking forward to seeing if i know how to tie 
my own shoelaces anymore 
but when they do leave the white house we will miss that 
jumbo jet she said referring admiringly to the spacious new 
133 million boeing 747 put into service last week as air force 
one i havent seen anything like it

the us military is training more 
personnel to work in chemical decontamination wards at field 
hospitals which would likely be overwhelmed if iraq were to 
unleash a major poison gas attack 
the training taking place in at least one major us base camp 
in saudi arabia comes as doctors and others who work in the 
decontamination units question their ability to handle a steady 
patient load over a lengthy period 
americans also are training saudis in how to decontaminate 
people who come in contact with chemicals at one base such 
training is being conducted every other day with groups of 10 to 12 
saudis from military medical facilities 
even though iraq is their neighbor and has had these chemical 
weapons for years the saudis were really unprepared one air 
force officer involved in the training said 
most commanders discount the likelihood of any iraqi attack and 
have expressed confidence that their forces could intercept any 
missiles or planes carrying chemical weapons into saudi territory 
but as a precaution the united states has set up a series of 
field hospitals each with a separate area for decontaminating 
troops who come under chemical attack 
iraq has a large stock of chemical and nerve agents western 
intelligence sources have said 
saddam hussein boasted in april that iraq has developed binary 
weapons warheads or shells in which two chemical agents are housed 
in separate compartments these mingle on impact to form deadly 
gases 
the iraqis used chemical weapons mainly mustard gas and 
blister agents against iranian troops during their eightyear 
war which ended in ceasefire in 1988 
these did not prove especially effective western analysts 
believe that in military terms the casualties were low less than 
300 killed and possibly 20000 injured 
however the gas attacks had a considerable impact on iranian 
morale forcing infantrymen to wear the heavy protective suits and 
gas masks and thus reducing their fighting efficiency by about 
onethird 
most of the us field hospitals in saudi arabia have permanent 
staffs of about 20 people with a goal of treating 30 casualties an 
hour provided two thirds of the patients are walkins 
its a bit optimistic in this weather capt james t 
walker an air force doctor in charge of one of the field units 
said of the treatment targets 
walker said the units likely would need additional personnel in 
the event of heavy casualties because the treatment staff would 
have to work in bulky protective clothing and wear gas masks a 
problem in the sweltering saudi temperatures 
we will need to rotate people because its quite strenuous 
he said 
the facility walker runs is training additional people from the 
bases combat support group 
a similar facility at another large american installation 
already has added 19 people to its regular staff of 15 and has 
contingency plans to draw more help from that bases support group 
if necessary 
its going to be hard but i think it can be done air force 
sgt keith tucker who runs that unit said monday when asked if 
his staff could meet the treatment goals 
he said it would not be difficult to train additional help 
quickly anything that we do here can be taught to anybody 
in most cases soldiers who come into contact with chemical 
agents would be hosed down then have their protective suits 
stripped or cut off 
if the agents had seeped through to their inside uniforms those 
too would be removed and any exposed skin treated tucker said 
the british have provided the us forces with scanners that 
detect most chemical agents and those would be used to scan 
patients before they are sent to the field hospital for treatment 
of other injuries 
the decontamination tents are not airconditioned although some 
can be equipped with cooling systems 
walker and tucker said it can get stifling hot inside the tents 
when they are filled with staff and patients 
but col pj pettijohn the commander of air force personnel at 
one large us base camp said it was unlikely the tents would be 
airconditioned because most chemical agents break down faster in 
heat 
heat is not necessarily an enemy in this case he said

troops of the dead president samuel doe 
bombarded rebels in monrovia with shells today in a desperate stand 
from the roof of the fortified presidential mansion 
an interim government named aug 30 in gambia by a unity 
conference said it was sending envoys to monrovia in preparation 
for taking over the country 
but rival rebel forces control various sectors of the country 
and charles taylors mainstream rebel national patriotic front 
pledged monday to keep fighting until a 3000strong west african 
task force sent to end the war withdraws from the capital 
doe died after being wounded in fighting with a breakaway rebel 
faction that captured him sunday the us state department 
confirmed doe was dead 
the british broadcasting corp quoted witnesses who visited a 
rebel camp near monrovia as saying does mutilated body was on 
display there 
they did not say how he died but that they watched rebel leader 
prince johnson interrogate doe about the disappearance of millions 
of dollars of state funds during his 10year rule 
shells exploded and gunfire crackled in the ravaged capital 
today as johnsons fighters searched the city for doe loyalists 
does elite presidential guard which includes the feared 
israelitrained special antiterrorist unit turned heavy artillery 
on the roof of the multistory executive mansion on the rebels 
west african soldiers sent to end the 8 months of fighting were 
ordered to intervene 
the chairman of the economic community of west african states 
said he told the force to protect loyalists and family members of 
doe who remained in the clifftop presidential residence 
i think it is now urgent to try and do something about 
protecting these 230 or so doe supporters from factional or tribal 
revenge the chairman gambian president sir dawda jawara said 
in harare zimbabwe 
johnson said monday he would lead liberia until the transitional 
government is set up 
but representatives of the government can expect a hostile 
reception from taylor whose 10000strong rebel army is the 
biggest in the country 
he has called the interim government a puppet administration 
of the west african economic group 
a statement issued today in banjul gambia by the governments 
president amos sawyer said the delegations first priority would 
be to distribute relief supplies and food in the capital where 
people are dying of starvation 
sources close to sawyer said he was urged to send envoys by 
johnson and brig gen david nimley whom doe loyalists named 
acting president shortly after his capture 
liberia has been without effective government for months and 
monrovia has been torn by fighting involving the two rebel armies 
and doe loyalists since midjuly 
taylor said monday his movement would intensify its efforts to 
bring this crisis to an end by moving into monrovia at any 
expense 
he spoke in a broadcast over the state radio which is behind 
his lines 
he has made similar threats before but his army of mainly 
untrained peasant youths who have overrun most of liberia has 
been bogged down on monrovias outskirts for nearly three months 
some of the heaviest fighting has occurred since the west 
african task force sailed in aug 14 to try to enforce a ceasefire 
taylor started the war when he invaded from ivory coast on dec 
24 johnson who was one of taylors top commanders quarreled with 
him in march and formed a splinter group 
the three warring factions have slaughtered more than 5000 of 
this countrys 23 million people often because of their tribal 
affiliations half a million liberians have fled to neighboring 
states or are displaced within their country 
doe was a krahn one of 14 small tribes in liberia johnson is 
the son of a gio and taylor is of mixed americoliberian and 
native ancestry 
about 2100 us marines are based on ships off monrovia and 
assigned to guard the us embassy and residential compound they 
have evacuated hundreds of foreigners from the city but have orders 
not to intervene in the war

and removed from office be sent back to prison for carrying guns 
on a turkey hunt 
herb lepchenske one of two officers who conducted a parole 
revocation hearing monday said he will recommend nixon serve 10 
months of the remaining three years of his fiveyear sentence 
nixon 61 was paroled in november 1989 on a conviction of lying to 
a federal grand jury 
the sevenmember parole commission in atlanta will review the 
recommendation and could give nixon as little as a reprimand or as 
much as the full remaining three years of the sentence 
at the hearing nixon said he was carrying guns in cases when he 
was arrested april 25 for hunting wild turkey over a baited field 
nixon who is appealing his conviction on that state offense 
testified he had changed his mind about hunting that day and never 
took the guns out 
chester diaz a state department of wildlife investigator 
testified that nixon asked him to pretend he wasnt carrying a 
rifle and a shotgun nixon knew the guns he had were illegal for a 
felon and asked if he could switch them for an oldfashioned 
muzzleloader diaz said 
i told him no sir said diaz 
im very very remorseful for what ive done nixon said 
monday i havent slept much since this happened

japan chided for moving slowly to aid the 
international campaign against iraq is considering giving 2 
billion to the three nations hit hardest by the economic sanctions 
on iraq an official said today 
the aid would go to egypt jordan and turkey said hiroyasu 
horio an official with the ministry of international trade and 
industry he would not elaborate 
local news reports said the aid would be extended through the 
world bank and international monetary fund and 600 million would 
be sent as early as midseptember 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said figures were not 
decided but the government was moving to set them quickly 
on friday us treasury secretary nicholas brady visited tokyo 
on a world tour seeking 105 billion to help the three nations 
withstand the unimposed economic embargo on iraq which invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
japan has already promised a 1 billion aid package for 
multinational peacekeeping forces in saudi arabia including food 
water vehicles and prefabricated housing for nonmilitary uses 
but critics in the united states have complained that japan 
should do more since its economy depends heavily on oil from the 
middle east japan imports 99 percent of its oil 
i hope that when the total shape of our contribution is 
clearly shown this kind of criticism will be greatly reduced 
watanabe said at a news briefing 
some of them criticisms are based on a lack of knowledge 
about what we are doing and some of them are affected by previously 
held perceptions of japan 
japans constitution bans the use of force in settling 
international disputes and japanese law restricts the military to 
japanese territory except for participation in ceremonial 
occasions overseas 
but horio said the trade ministry is considering chartering 
foreign airplanes to send provisions as soon as possible for 
the multinational forces possibly next week 
the pressure from abroad is getting so strong horio said 
citing the constitution japanese airlines and unions have 
demanded the government limit items they carry to nonmilitary 
goods and refused to fly over dangerous areas 
when japan last week sent a panamanian ship loaded with 800 
vehicles and other equipment for the international peacekeeping 
effort in the middle east its departure was held up for hours by 
negotiations with a seamens union that had refused to enter the 
troubled region 
horio said the government plans to send more vehicles 2000 
trucks and 100 buses for the gulf forces but he refused to provide 
details or the date of departure to eliminate unnecessary trouble 
before the departure 
kyodo news service quoting unnamed sources said the government 
is considering sending military personnel overseas by temporarily 
transferring them to a new peace cooperation team to support 
united nations activities 
watanabe said nothing has been decided on that yet but the 
government hoped to have legislation ready by the end of this month 
for presentation to parliament 
what we have determined is we should come up with a decision 
to change the law so that we can send some people in addition to 
money in this kind of juncture he said they might not be from 
the defense forces he said 
japan already has said it will send 100 medical personnel to 
help the international forces in the gulf watanabe said the first 
group of 20 may be announced before the end of the week 
he said that because of legal problems with sending personnel 
abroad in such cases we cannot fully establish ourselves as a 
kind of initiator of world policy as we wish

lt gov evelyn murphy walked the plank and 
dropped out of the governors race after staging a mutiny the 
minute gov michael dukakis left her at the helm to take part in a 
trade mission to europe 
murphy quit the race monday days after she ordered cuts in 
state spending in dukakis absence and against his orders 
her maneuver was blasted as a desperate stunt to rescue her bid 
for the democratic nomination but she denied those accusations and 
said she was simply looking out for the state while dukakis was 
away 
now there can be no confusion she said monday in dropping 
out this is not a political ploy it is an honest and necessary 
act of leadership 
her campaign said the main reason for her withdrawal was that 
she could not win campaign strategist michael goldman said weekend 
surveys showed her support growing but not enough to land her the 
nomination in the threeway primary sept 18 
however a poll released sunday by the boston globe and wbztv 
said her unfavorable rating rose from 38 percent to 49 percent 
on friday murphy unveiled plans she said would save the state 
up to 150 million and help overcome a deficit she issued 
executive orders to fire an estimated 1000 workers and cut 
salaries for others she also asked agencies to cut their 1992 
budgets 10 percent 
today it is even more clear to me that these disputes are 
necessary she said monday it is also clear that the political 
dispute about my decisions is diverting attention away from the 
very serious problems that made them necessary 
dukakis had postponed his trip for five days waiting for murphy 
to unveil her fiscal plans he finally left on thursday with a 
warning not to take any drastic action 
in a statement released in boston on monday he was conciliatory 
i know something about disappointment in politics he said 
evelyn murphy ran a strong and progressive campaign and she put 
her heart into it 
dukakis is scheduled to return friday 
murphy said she would help former attorney general francis 
bellotti who leads in the polls for governor however some murphy 
backers could still vote for her because she left the race far too 
late to have her name removed from the ballot 
bellotti predicted he would gain from her withdrawal because 
many of the people who were with evelyn murphy are people who 
would normally be with me john silber the other democratic 
candidate countered her endorsement of frank bellotti means 
frank bellotti has precisely one vote more than he had before 
silber on leave as boston university president has staked out 
conservative democrats and independent voters 
murphy who strongly backed dukakis in his presidential bid in 
1988 admitted he could undo her orders on monday she reviewed 
those plans with finance secretary l edward lashman who said the 
projected savings were highly inflated

president corazon aquino refused 
today the birthday of her ousted predecessor ferdinand marcos to 
allow his remains to be buried in the philippines 
meanwhile a bomb exploded at a parking lot inside the suburban 
philippine army headquarters but no one was injured army 
spokesman col benjamin enrile said 
there were no suspects he said it was the 20th explosion in 
the capital since aug 13 police believe most bombings were 
carried out by rightwing extremists 
about 1000 of marcos supporters marked his 73rd birthday by 
marching through through manilas streets 
marcos widow imelda appealed to mrs aquino on monday to 
allow her to bring home her husbands remains from hawaii marcos 
died there last sept 28 
the return of marcos has to await a more propitious time 
mrs aquino said in a statement read by press secretary tomas 
gomez prudence dictates that additional occasions for 
debilitating and distracting activities be avoided 
marcos was ousted in february 1986 and driven into exile by a 
popular revolution mrs aquino consistently refused to let him 
return citing security concerns and she continues to bar mrs 
marcos from the philippines 
after a roman catholic mass today for marcos house of 
representatives minority leader rodolfo albano read a statement 
praising the achievements of the former leader 
albano said marcos was a good man judged at a wrong time by 
the wrong minds apparently referring to mrs aquinos government 
everyone has human faults for who has none the statement 
added it is said that when a man is gone only his misdeeds are 
often remembered no matter how few forgetting all his good 
deeds 
the statement also appeared as a fullpage advertisement in 
several manila newspapers 
among those who attended the mass were some former members of 
marcos cabinet several congressmen and retired generals 
mrs marcos said monday in honolulu that she was would do 
everything to support mrs aquino and begged her to reconsider 
her ban 
mrs aquino replied sincerity is subject to proof 
she said she would make no deals with mrs marcos until the 
former first lady returns money allegedly taken from the 
philippines the aquino government has accused the marcoses of 
stealing up to 10 billion during 20 years in power 
the marcoses face 35 civil suits in the philippines mrs marcos 
was acquitted in the united states of racketeering charges marcos 
died before he could be arraigned

the archbishop of canterbury said today there were 
signs of progress in efforts to free his envoy terry waite and 
other western hostages in lebanon 
the most rev robert runcie however said he did not plan to 
travel to lebanon to try to speed any release 
runcie was speaking a day after released irish hostage brian 
keenan said waite was definitely alive and the european 
community announced plans to normalize relations with tehran 
iran has helped to negotiate the release of several western 
hostages 
waites cousin john waite had suggested that runcie was the 
obvious choice to travel to the middle east to seek freedom for 
the remaining 13 western hostages 
runcie told a news conference that while he grieved for 
waite a hostage for more than 3 years this was not the time 
for gimmickry or the pursuit of tempting shortcuts 
keenan 39 is the first released hostage to report contact with 
waite 
during an interview monday with independent television news 
keenan said he had been held in the same beirut apartment as the 
51yearold waite and that the anglican envoy had been ill 
runcie said he was heartened to have clear confirmation that 
waite was alive he said he was also encouraged by signs of a 
diplomatic breakthrough in relations between the european community 
and iran 
we too have maintained our own direct contacts with iran and 
will continue to do so he said 
full relations between the ec and iran were suspended last year 
when iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for the 
death of salman rushdie the british author of the satanic 
verses khomeini said the book was blasphemous 
runcie said while the iranians do not hold the hostages they 
undoubtedly have considerable influence with the captors 
they have demonstrated that influence three times this year 
with the release of americans robert polhill and frank reed and 
brian keenan 
waite disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his west beirut 
hotel to negotiate with islamic jihad an extremist moslem group 
for the release of two us hostages 
six americans four britons two west germans and an italian are 
still missing in lebanon 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16

in a case closely watched by both 
guncontrol advocates and opponents a federal judge dismissed a 
challenge by the national rifle association on californias ban on 
automatic weapons 
us district judge edward dean price said monday that the 
second amendment which gives citizens the right to bear arms does 
not apply to laws passed by state governments as the nra contended 
in their case 
he also ruled that californians constitutional right of privacy 
does not equate with the right of selfdefense 
the nra and the fresno rifle and pistol club filed the lawsuit 
in february to stop enforcement of californias ban on automatic 
weapons the ban took effect jan 1 
we conclude that the constitution has left the question of gun 
control to the several states price wrote there are no 
federal constitutional provisions that have been offended by this 
state act 
the decision quickly drew response from both sides of the 
guncontrol issue 
the courts decision is a tremendous victory for public 
safety california attorney general john van de kamp said 
this is just another step in the ongoing situation the 
hysterical reaction instead of making good laws said diana weeks 
of the fresno rifle and pistol club 
under the robertiroos assault weapons control act of 1989 it 
is illegal to sell advertise manufacture or import more than 50 
specific types of semiautomatic rifles pistols and shotguns 
the bill was passed in the wake of a schoolyard shooting in 
stockton in january 1989 that left five children dead

nasa mechanics trying to beat a 
launch deadline installed new fuel pumps in the leaky shuttle 
columbia in hopes of getting the spaceship aloft next week 
columbia whose liftoff with the 150 million astro observatory 
has been delayed twice by fuel leaks and once by problems with one 
of its telescopes must take off next week or wait until after the 
october launch of discovery 
discovery will have to be delayed until late 1991 if it misses 
its launch window 
nasa planned to test columbias new pumps today by flushing the 
system with helium in the pumps that were removed earlier helium 
tests failed to find leaks and officials planned to try again with 
supercold liquid hydrogen to simulate actual fueling conditions 
agency spokesman george diller said today 
the space agency hasnt sent up a shuttle in more than four 
months because of fuel leaks in two of its three shuttles that 
forced a grounding of the entire threevehicle fleet 
columbias aft compartment flooded with hydrogen during fueling 
for a launch attempt last week and engineers suspected a bad fuel 
pump the leak was in a different area from the one that earlier 
affected columbia and atlantis 
its been peaks and valleys and were in a little bit of a 
valley with atlantis and particularly columbia right now said 
dick richards commander of discoverys upcoming flight 
but im hoping that this thing will turn around and two 
years from now we wont even remember these hydrogen leaks i think 
theyll be a little bit of a footnote in shuttle history 
meanwhile a leak in discoverys cooling system has preparations 
for that flight several days behind schedule its mission is to 
deploy a satellite scientists hope will become the first spacecraft 
to orbit the suns poles 
discovery must be launched between oct 5 and oct 23 
otherwise its 750 million mission will have to wait until 1991 
when earth is aligned properly again with the sun and jupiter 
the sun probe called ulysses will use jupiters gravity to be 
whipped into the proper orbit around the sun 
engineers have traced discoverys leaks to a vent in the ammonia 
boiler which is losing about 1 percent of its freon contents each 
day mission managers are recommending nasa fly with the leaky 
boiler as long as the leak remains small diller said 
minor leakage will not jeopardize discoverys flight because 
there still would be enough coolant for the fourday mission 
diller said the boiler is needed to cool the shuttle during 
landings 
the leaks not big enough to bother with and it doesnt look 
like its going to change diller said they dont think its 
worth the impact to go change it 
if the part had to be replaced discovery still could lift off 
by oct 23 but its going to make it a lot harder richards 
said

air grievances against the moslem population that had been banned 
by local authorities

raised three months ago after a local transport company strike 
polarized the two ethnic groups

senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r 
biden jr said today supreme court nominee david souter should 
answer specific questions on abortion and other politically 
volatile issues at his confirmation hearings 
at this fateful moment in our history we have a right to 
know the answers to such questions said biden ddel as 
judiciary committee chairman he will preside over the hearings on 
souters nomination scheduled to begin thursday 
meanwhile the president of the national organization for women 
charged that souters nomination is part of a rightwing campaign 
to stack the court with justices hostile to the rights of women and 
minorities 
now president molly yard told a news conference souter is 
almost neanderthal and said his record indicates he would vote 
to overturn the supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade ruling that 
legalized abortion 
youre literally talking about womens lives she said 
thats what at stake 
biden brushed aside any notion that it would be wrong to force a 
supreme court nominee to give his views on such matters as 
abortion civil rights and freedom of religion that will come 
before the court 
all signs point to the need for very extensive detailed 
questioning of this nominee biden said 
he said he has not decided yet whether the federal judge from 
new hampshire should be confirmed but he did acknowledge that a 
number of questions have been raised in my mind 
he called the nomination the most important business to come 
before the senate this year and said souters impact on the court 
would linger long after iraqi president saddam hussein has 
bitten the dust long after the current budget crisis has been 
replaced by some other fiscal dilemma 
he said he was not looking for promises as to how souter 
would decide controversial cases but added that supreme court 
candidates in the past had often been questioned about their 
opinions on major issues 
he said that was especially true in the cases of nominees such 
as judge souter with very limited records that give rise to almost 
total uncertainty 
biden dismissed a statement by souter that his judicial 
philosophy is that of an interpretivist 
many scholars and jurists travel on this common banner 
biden said he said some of souters comments in the past could 
place him among the more rigid of these interpreters 
the only way to determine precisely what the label means in 
souters case will be to ask how he views specific issues biden 
said 
theres nothing wrong with putting to judge souter some rather 
specific questions relating to constitutional issues including 
religion free speech civil rights and abortion and expect some 
specific answsers biden said 
what little we know of judge souter and it is quite 
tentative emphasizes how important it is that we thoroughly 
question him biden said 
ms yard said the nominee interprets the constitution according 
to its original intent in 1787 a time when all blacks were 
slaves and women were the property of their husbands we cannot and 
will not as women accept such a stacking of the court on behalf of 
rightwing zealots 
eleanor smeal head of the fund for a feminist majority and 
former now president predicted that souter if confirmed to the 
high court would be a consistent roadblock to the advancement of 
women and minorities

at least 25 people died today 
in black faction fighting and african national congress leader 
nelson mandela said the governments failure to halt the carnage 
put the peace process in distress 
mandela led an ancdelegation that met with president fw de 
klerk to discuss violence that has plagued black townships near 
johannesburg since aug 12 claiming more than 650 lives 
the government came under heavy attack during the meeting 
for its failure to take visible measures to deal with the 
situation mandela told journalists adding that he accused the 
government of waging war against the anc 
he said the anc would do everything possible to continue talks 
with the government on a new constitution to give the black 
majority political power 
but there was no doubt the peace process is in distress 
mandela said 
there was no immediate government comment on the meeting 
police said 22 people were killed early today in fighting in 
katlehong township and two were killed in vosloorus rival bands of 
zulus and xhosas fought with axes spears and knives 
at least one black man was hacked to death today and several 
injured on a train in johannesburg by men with machetes who 
rampaged through carriages attacking passengers police said 
the fighting has largely pitted xhosas and other blacks loyal to 
the anc against zulus tied to the conservative inkatha party both 
factions oppose apartheid but differ over leadership and plans for 
a future south africa 
constitution development minister gerrit viljoen attacked 
mandela for his criticism of police during the fighting and 
charged the anc was not helping to end violence it was the 
strongest attack on mandela by the government in recent months 
mr mandela lays all responsibility for curbing violence on 
the shoulders of the government all political organizations have a 
duty and responsibility actively to contribute towards calming 
excited emotions and restoring peace and stability viljoen said 
in a statement monday night 
the anc must cease claiming total innocence for themselves 
and their followers and laying blame on their opponents or the 
police he said 
mandela and the anc the countrys largest black opposition 
group have repeatedly charged that police instigated violence or 
aided inkatha fighters police and government officials have 
rejected the charges 
mandela told a weekend meeting of the organization of african 
unity in uganda that south africa would be drowned in blood 
unless the government took steps to end the violence he also said 
the growing violence threatened to derail talks between the anc and 
the government on ending white minority rule 
the anc and the government are preparing for talks expected 
early next year on sharing political power with the black 
majority de klerk has promised to end apartheid 
in other developments a bomb exploded early today outside a 
johannesburg cinema where a liberal newspaper is holding a film 
festival police said the bomb caused little damage and there were 
no injuries they said 
the weekly mail is holding an annual festival of progressive 
films at the cinema police said no group claimed responsibility 
for the blast but officers said it could be the work of whites 
opposed to ending apartheid 
six political prisoners all members of the anc were released 
today in cape town the men were freed under a recent agreement 
between the government and the anc on freeing political detainees

the soviet union and west germany have reached a 
compromise on how much money bonn will pay moscow for the pullout 
of red army troops from east germany west germanys finance 
minister put the figure at 76 billion 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in an interview with wire 
service reporters refused to specify how much money or say how the 
compromise agreement was reached monday but he said it was 
something that will satisfy us and our partners 
a compromise is a compromise the main thing is we have an 
agreement he said this issue is no longer an obstacle 
finance minister theo waigel cited the 76 billion figure at a 
meeting of conservative christian democrat and christian socialist 
members of parliament in west berlin today the finance ministry 
press office said 
the west german television network zdf said president mikhail s 
gorbachev and west german chancellor helmut kohl had reached an 
agreement in principle on the money during the 30minute 
telephone call 
also monday german officials announced a 636 million deal with 
moscow to help troubled east germthey are motivated by profit greed and 
avarice said sen 
alfonse damato rny theirs is an attitude that i think really 
is repugnant 
to express displeasure with the level of support the senate on 
monday adopted a resolution threatening a deterioration in us 
relations with any nation that doesnt contribute enough 
in tokyo today a japanese official said japan was considering 
giving 2 billion to the three nations hardest hit by the economic 
sanctions against iraq that would be on top of 1 billion the 
country has already pledged to support the military effort against 
iraq 
hiroyasu horio an official of the ministry of international 
trade and industry said the 2 billion would go to egypt jordan 
and turkey news reports in tokyo said the money would be extended 
through the world bank and international monetary fund with the 
first 600 million being sent as early as midseptember 
the senate resolution attached to a spending bill for the 
postal service and other agencies directed the president to 
present congress a detailed report on the administrations 
costsharing efforts by nov 30 
during his consultations with other international leaders 
bush should consider stressing that failure by any country to 
actively contribute in the most appropriate manner for that country 
could have a detrimental impact on its bilateral relationship with 
the united states the resolution said 
the approval of the measure the first such congressional action 
since bush ordered us troops to saudi arabia reflected 
lawmakers reaction to complaints by voters that the united states 
is shouldering too much of the burden 
the united states cannot play uncle sugar to the world said 
sen dennis deconcini dariz one of the primary sponsors 
sen john mccain rariz called japans 1 billion pledge only 
a few token shillings he contended that a more adequate 
response given japans economic standing would be an 8 billion 
pledge 
the contemptible tokenism of the actions of the japanese 
government to date merit nothing but the worlds contempt and 
american hostility mccain said if combat arises it will not 
be japanese boys whose lives are at risk it will be american 
boys 
japan which ran up a 49 billion trade surplus with the united 
states last year was singled out for the bulk of the criticism 
but senators said they also were unhappy with the response so far 
by west germany which has agreed to supply air and sea transport 
but turned down a us request for more help in defraying the costs 
of keeping troops in the persian gulf 
west germany and japan both contend that their postworld war ii 
constitutions bar them from sending troops to the persian gulf 
the united states is seeking approximately 28 billion through 
the end of 1991 for the gulf campaign of that amount 10 billion 
would go to supply aid to egypt turkey and jordan and the 
remainder would pay for the us military buildup 
while brady had little luck getting much more than words of 
encouragement from france britain south korea and japan last 
week secretary of state james a baker iii reported more success 
on a similar fundraising mission to oilrich middle eastern 
nations 
baker said monday that saudi arabia the united arab emirates 
and the exiled government of kuwait had pledged 12 billion split 
between the military effort and the economic assistance package 
but some critics charged that consumers from america and other 
countries were in reality footing the bill through higher energy 
prices 
edwin rothschild head of the consumer group citizen action 
said the saudis stood to make an extra 32 billion monthly from 
the crisis based on a 10abarrel rise in oil costs since iraqs 
invasion of kuwait and a 2 millionbarrel per day increase in saudi 
production their share of the us military costs was reportedly 
only 500 million a month 
the administration has been stressing the need for a united 
front against iraqi president saddam hussein something analysts 
say is not helped by the lukewarm reception by some allied 
countries

an independent study commission created amid 
furor over government funding of controversial art urged congress 
today not to impose antiobscenity curbs on works subsidized by the 
national endowment for the arts 
it also called on the arts agency chairman john e frohnmayer 
to scrap a requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge not to 
use federal funds to produce works that might be deemed obscene 
the bipartisan 12member panel established by congress last 
fall also proposed overhauling the grantmaking machinery of the 
endowment 
maintaining the principle of an open society requires all of 
us at times to put up with much we do not like but the bargain 
has proved in the long run a good one the commission said 
the house is preparing to begin debating soon legislative 
proposals to extend the life of the embattled arts endowment with 
restrictions on the kinds of art that can receive federal funds 
the neas statutory authority expires sept 30 
rep e thomas coleman rmo a key figure in house 
negotiations on the endowments future said the report could serve 
as the possible framework for a compromise but he said congress 
probably will insist on including some antiobscenity restrictions 
in its final bill even if it only reaffirms supreme court rulings 
on the issue 
jeffrey chester a spokesman for the national campaign for 
freedom of expression a nonprofit artists organization praised 
the proposal to eliminate frohnmayers antiobscenity pledge for 
grant recipients 
but chester expressed concern that the report if endorsed by 
congress would turn the nea chairman into a new arts czar with 
sole authority over final grantmaking decisions while diminishing 
the traditional role of nea peerreview panels in selecting grants 
for approval 
the commission is tightening the vise of censorship chester 
said 
the nea has been buffeted for more than a year by criticism from 
conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists over its 
support for works that some regarded as pornographic or 
sacrilegious 
at the urging of sen jesse helms rnc congress amended the 
endowments current 171 million budget last fall to include a ban 
on support for works that may be considered obscene including 
homoerotic and sadomasochistic images 
the commission unanimously urged congress not to hobble the nea 
with antiobscenity restrictions and in effect to trust the 
endowment chairman to approve grants for works of artistic 
excellence that are not obscene or otherwise illegal 
insuring the freedom of expression necessary to nourish the 
arts while bearing in mind limits of public understanding and 
tolerance requires unusual wisdom prudence and most of all 
common sense said cochairmen leonard garment a washington 
lawyer and john brademas president of new york university 
at a news conference this morning the study commission 
recommended diminishing the role of the neas peer review 
panels which select grant applications for approval and giving 
the nea chairman sole explicit authority to make final grant 
decisions without restrictions by congress 
the report urged reviving a system under which committees of the 
national council on the arts the endowments advisory body would 
review peer panel selections before final grant awards are made 
with the aim of increasing the neas accountability to the 
taxpaying public the commission said the peer panels which 
consist of outside artists and arts managers should be expanded 
to include persons knowledgeable about the arts but not earning 
their living in them 
the report declared that obscenity is not protected speech 
and that the nea is prohibited from funding the production of 
works which are obscene or otherwise illegal but it said the 
endowment should stay out of the business of defining what is 
obscene leaving that as a legal matter for the courts to decide 
likewise the panel said it unanimously opposed legislative 
changes to impose specific restrictions on the content of works of 
art supported by the endowment 
it added content restrictions may raise serious 
constitutional issues would be inherently ambiguous and would 
almost certainly involve the endowment and the department of 
justice in costly and unproductive lawsuits 
the commission suggested that congress instead approve a 
preamble to legislation reauthorizing the nea which would 
declare that the arts belong to all the people of the united 
states and should foster mutual respect for the diverse beliefs 
and values of all persons and groups 
the obscenity ban approved by congress last fall was prompted by 
criticism of past nea support for exhibitions of works by 
photographer robert mapplethorpe which contained sexually graphic 
images and by artist andres serrano which some critics denounced 
as blasphemous 
after congress acted frohnmayer instituted the antiobscenity 
pledge for grant recipients which has caused widespread protests 
in the arts community 
by the neas latest count nearly a dozen artists and arts 
organizations have refused to sign the antiobscenity pledge and 
have forfeited their endowment grants the pledge also is being 
challenged on constitutional grounds in federal lawsuits in new 
york and los angeles

limit the use of private cars in central paris and give priority to 
public transport he said the city intends to compensate for the 
ban by providing thousands of new parking spaces in proposed 
underground garages

will backfire by attracting more motorists with the prospect of 
less congested streets

a series of copycat suicides in italy has led to 
calls for the media to limit coverage of such deaths 
one major newspaper said it would publish only scant reports 
from now on and the staterun raitv said it was limiting coverage 
to latenight newscasts which have the fewest viewers 
since the beginning of september 10 people have taken their 
lives in a similar fashion running a tube from the exhaust pipe 
into their car and turning on the ignition 
newspapers have paid considerable attention to the suicides 
examining the victims pasts and editorializing on the ills of 
modern italian society that might lead someone to commit suicide 
in one of the cases police said they found a newspaper opened 
to the story of a previous suicide on the seat next to the victim 
after the ninth suicide last weekend the rome newspaper il 
tempo announced in a frontpage editorial that it would limit 
further reporting on suicides to a few lines on an inside page 
the information blackout can help to break the tragic and 
repetitive chain il tempo said 
indro montanelli editor of the milan newspaper il giornale 
disagreed 
in principle there is no news that shouldnt be published to 
write about suicides is dangerous in that case we wont write 
about rapes robberies murders smoking terrorism montanelli 
said if we follow that logic we wont put out newspapers 
anymore 
gianni rocca deputy editor of la repubblica of rome agreed 
with montanelli for how long would we have to be silent about 
such news for a day a week for our whole life he said

referring to the slogan used by the lottery 
extra maintenance people were added this week to keep terminals 
working across the state and additional phone lines were installed 
at lottery headquarters to handle increased telephone traffic mrs 
paul said 
the national record for a lottery prize is 115 million which 
was awarded in pennsylvania to 14 ticketholders some of them 
individuals and some groups 
but the us record of the largest single lottery prize still 
goes to sheelah ryan of winter springs who won a florida lotto 
jackpot of 551 million two years ago 
lotto jackpots roll over when no one picks all the winning 
numbers the lottery department then estimates the size of the next 
weeks jackpot based on sales projections 
the odds of someone picking the winning numbers are about 
onein14 million 
another concern for lottery officials is the design of the 
billboards announcing jackpot estimates which dont have space for 
a ninefigure jackpot the boards were not originally prepared 
for the extra digi said bernie torra spokesman for ackerley 
communications of miami lottery billboard handlers in south 
florida were working on it

president bush will tell congress tonight that 
the persian gulf crisis has forged a new world order in which 
the superpower adversaries of the cold war now stand united to 
reverse iraqs conquest of kuwait 
bush will follow up the address with a televised message for the 
iraqi people declaring that the world is united against their 
governments invasion of kuwait 
bush fresh from his oneday summit with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev in helsinki will go before a joint session of 
the house and senate with a nationally broadcast address at 9 pm 
edt 
aides said the president will seek the nations support for his 
decision to send more than 100000 troops to the gulf region to put 
pressure on saddam and deter a possible invasion of oilrich saudi 
arabia 
hes going to be very candid with them about exactly what 
were doing there and why and what our purposes are said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater its going to require a 
commitment of resources and time and energy by the american 
people 
then on wednesday morning bush will tape a television message 
in the oval office with arabic subtitles and voice translation to 
spell out why much of the world has united against iraqs conquest 
of kuwait fitzwater said the tape was being made as a 
counteroffer to iraqs proposal to send a team of interviewers to 
question bush 
fitzwater said it was irrelevant that bush had chosen a forum 
different from the one that iraq suggested the issue was the 
president said he would like to have equal kinds of access to the 
iraqi people that the united states has granted to saddam hussein 
and we assume that is the essence of the invitation the 
spokesman said 
if iraq declines to broadcast the tape fitzwater said it will 
be made available to other arab countries as well as nations 
around the world 
the iraqi government has not been forthcoming in telling the 
people of that country whats happening fitzwater said he said 
the people of iraq are generally unaware of resolutions at the 
united nations and the arab league condemning the invasion or the 
flood of refugees that it has created 
the address marks the third time that bush has addressed 
lawmakers during his 20 months in the white house while congress 
has been largely supportive of his gulf policy many of its leaders 
have urged him to go before the nation with a speech spelling out 
us objectives and the risks in protecting the regions vast 
supplies of oil 
the occasion presents bush with an opportunity to prod lawmakers 
to conclude a longstalled agreement with the white house to cut 
the budget deficit by slashing spending and raising taxes 
fitzwater told reporters the gulf crisis points up the need to 
put our domestic house in order and reach a budget agreement on 
defense as well as other domestic issues 
were going to need all our strength to see us through in the 
persian gulf he said 
bush in the last two weeks has been promoting the thesis that 
the united states and soviet union have moved even closer together 
because of their joint opposition to iraqs aggression fitzwater 
said the president would expand on that theme tonight 
first of all hell report to the congress on the summit 
meeting with gorbachev the spokesman said then he wants to 
lay out to the congress and the people the overall situation in the 
gulf the status of our forces the role of the un 
he will use the summit in helsinki and the gulf situation to 
talk about the changing eastwest relations a new world order in 
which the superpowers join together in the un auspices to 
establish certain responsibilities for world stability fitzwater 
said 
despite their agreement on forcing iraq to retreat from kuwait 
the united states and soviet union still have differences on 
whether military force might eventually be needed 
gorbachev is pressing for a political solution in the gulf while 
bush has left military options open gorbachev did not make any 
commitment to remove all of the soviet trainers who are helping 
iraqs military although bush said their withdrawal would be 
helpful 
on the other hand the two leaders moved toward agreement at the 
summit to give moscow a major role in middle east peace efforts 
reversing a longstanding us policy against kremlin involvement 
under existing circumstances we feel they can be helpful 
fitzwater said however he said the idea of a middle east peace 
conference as espoused by moscow should not be linked to the 
existing situation 
on the eve of todays speech fitzwater said saddam was 
grasping at any straw he can find by mending relations with 
iran once a bitter enemy and by offering free oil to third world 
nations 
the man is desperate reaching out wherever he can 
fitzwater said 
bush meanwhile asked congress for 142 million so the 
governmentfinanced voice of america can broadcast its radio 
programs 24 hours a day in the persian gulf and throughout the 
middle east 
currently voa broadcasts only 7 hours a day to pay for 
increasing the arabic service bush proposed cutbacks in radio 
programs beamed to eastern europe and the soviet union 
also on monday bush called the leaders of france egypt 
turkey saudi arabia and canada to brief them on sundays summit 
with gorbachev 
the response has been overwhelmingly supportive and almost 
euphoric in many cases in terms of the soviet union and the united 
states being able to come together this way fitzwater said

the pentagon has detected some increase in 
military activity inside iraq near its borders with turkey and 
syria but a spokesman said today that there seems little 
indication that hostilities in the areas were imminent 
at a briefing spokesman pete williams declined to offer much 
detail about the movements 
however asked whether the movements involved air or ground 
troops williams said that as a general matter and not 
necessarily in this case such military activity could involve 
flights training flights that kind of thing 
asked whether the movement indicated increased forces he said 
not necessarily 
we are aware of some increase in military activity near the 
syrian and turkish borders but there is nothing to indicate 
imminent hostilities and beyond that i cannot characterize that 
activity for you williams said 
williams said that the number of iraqi forces in and around 
occupied kuwait remained stable at about 265000 troops and about 
2200 tanks 
the spokesman said the status of the forces has not changed 
substantially over the past week and that while their military 
posture remained defensive it could become offensive very 
quickly

iraqs saddam hussein is a frequent topic 
of conversation at american legion post 133 where the talk is as 
hot as old glory on fire 
i think we should drop an atomic bomb on his doorstep said 
haley rhoden i think we should get in there and whip them and 
get out 
others favored assassinating saddam whose soldiers invaded 
kuwait last month 
the russell barrett legion post has been in operation for 70 
years it was named for a soldier killed in world war i 
it has 300 members most of them world war ii veterans 
legionnaires must have served in the military during wartime and 
the members here know the cost of war 
near the entrance is a bronze plaque listing the towns world 
war ii dead and a sheet of paper under glass listing the vietnam 
dead each meeting ends with a 30second pause to remember the 
departed 
this is a place where men brag about how many relatives have 
gone to war where patriotism is fashionable and where the word 
peacenik is spat rather than spoken 
tshirts for sale behind the bar feature an american flag and 
say just try to burn this flag 
the legionnaires in this yakima valley farm town of 3300 look 
upon saddam as a sort of ultimate flagburner 
he appears to me to be a little hitler said del st george 
an apple grower who served in the navy in world war ii 
i still have a boy who is 21 and grandsons coming up and i 
dont want to see those boys getting shot at st george said 
but if they stomp him quick it wont take that long 
his opinions were shared by several legionnaires after a recent 
monthly business meeting 
the men gathered in the dark bar with its neon jukebox 
television and games were unanimous in their support of president 
bush and the us military effort against iraq 
most veterans would be supportive of what the president is 
doing said adjutant jack yearout i would hope that the 
american people would have the patriotism and guts to stand behind 
the president 
yearout compared saddam to hitler or stalin 
anybody that would gas his own people and use gas against his 
enemy in spite of the un charter has to be stopped he said 
ron butler a former policeman who is post commander said the 
united states was morally obligated to support kuwait 
we will lose men no doubt but they would be crazy to start 
actual combat with us butler said 
farley bennett a coast guard veteran said it is important for 
the nation to make sacrifices to stop saddam now 
i had two brothers in korea and two sons and a brother in 
vietnam bennett said we are herohappy boys 
i dont think this is going to end without conflict there are 
going to be some boys die on both sides but at least weve got 
world support

the president of the us chamber of commerce 
on tuesday called for a political revolution to solve the 
nations budget problems 
its an issue of over spending richard l lesher told 
reporters at a briefing on the chambers legislative agenda 
weve said so many times that to balance the budget you dont 
have to cut spending below current levels you need to cut the 
growth in spending 
bush administration and congressional negotiators met throughout 
the weekend but were unable to meet their monday deadline for 
reaching agreement on a deficitreducing package for the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 
without an agreement next years shortfall could surpass 250 
billion the highest ever and result in severe spending cuts on 
most federal programs under the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
lesher said the whole process is so politicized that its time 
for a political revolution hopefully led by the business 
community to demand that the problem be solved the same way all of 
us solve domestic budget problems or corporate budget problems by 
keeping spending in line with revenue 
among the items on the chambers legislative wishlist are a 
balancedbudget amendment to the constitution and enactment of 
lineitem veto authority for the president 
under current law the president must accept or reject in their 
entirety each of the 13 appropriations bills lineitem veto 
authority would permit him to throw out specific portions of the 
bills without vetoing the entire legislation 
lesher said the chamber is concerned about the effects of forced 
budget cuts on an economy that the organization predicts will fall 
into recession later this year 
we think that 100 billion in cuts would be a lot to 
swallow he said

the ad said it all major symphony 
orchestra illustrious history will consider relocation 
members of the beleaguered buffalo philharmonic orchestra say 
the ad is meant to be a tongueincheek gesture to get attention 
but its also a serious offer moving the musicians say would 
solve their problems with the orchestras management and board of 
directors 
orchestra officials said monday that the philharmonic may not 
open its fall season on time sept 22 because the musicians are 
refusing to negotiate cost savings 
the orchestra which has been running a 22 million deficit 
asked its musicians in july to agree to a wage freeze a smaller 
orchestra size and a shorter season to help cut 13 million in 
operating expenses 
musicians took up a collection last week to run the 300 
classified ad in fridays edition of usa today 
were going to entertain any offers that come as a result of 
the ad says frances morgante a violinist and chairwoman of the 
musicians negotiating team 
were a superb orchestra and everybody admits that but we 
constantly have to justify our existence and were tired of it 
added susie myers an english horn player 
management and the orchestra committee which represents the 
musicians have not met in two weeks said wilfred j larson the 
orchestras chairman 
if there are no talks weve got to shut the thing down 
larson said 
the musicians blame bloated frontoffice spending for the 
orchestras problems 
administrators blame the budgetary shortfalls on delayed and 
reduced funding from the state county and city and stalled 
development efforts

for each refugee who clears the 
jordanian border from iraq to wait for a flight home another drags 
into the makeshift camps in no mans land 
authorities predicted a turn of the tide monday with the 
proviso that they could not predict the flow from iraq on tuesday 
maj sabri rubeihat the jordanian spokesman at the border said 
3000 asians were processed but 3000 more arrived 
perhaps 50000 are backed up at the border but officials admit 
they are guessing one of those still trapped in the refugee camps 
is mohammed sana ullah from bangladesh 
this is a prison camp he said tuesday tears streaming down 
his dusty cheeks as he spoke at the shaalan iii camp were dying 
in this desert 
its still a nightmare said jim nuttal of save the 
children people think itll all go away but it wont this will 
go on for months 
nuttal manages this latest encampment a cluster of tents on 
raw scorpioninfested desert the shaalan i and shaalan ii camps 
also receive refugees mostly asians who have made their way 
kuwait where food shortages and scattered shooting are driving out 
hundreds of thousands of foreign workers 
shaalan iii is also called mercy camp but many of the 5000 
bangladeshis brought here over the past few days from overcrowded 
shaalan i say that is a bitter misnomer 
ullah who left the bangladesh air force to work as a contract 
sergeant in kuwait cornered nuttal to demand action first he 
talked tough detailing his 15 days wait in what he called hell 
nuttal was sympathetic 
we will stop it he said i promise you every bit of 
energy 
that was as far as he got ullahs nerves cracked and he wailed 
out his anguish 
sobbing shaking he waved an arm toward the tents and trucks 
and strewn garbage and shouted id like to burn all these bloody 
damned things 
around him a crowd of gesticulating refugees added their own 
pleas they said they had seen buses taking people directly from 
shaalan i to amman meaning later arrivals were getting out first 
even more than the scarce food and water or the lack of 
shelter the camp dwellers railed at the uncertainty no one knows 
when they will leave 
ullah suffers from a thyroid condition and is out of medicine 
camp doctors want him to see a specialist but hes afraid of 
missing the bus that might take him a step closer to home he said 
he has been here 15 days 
friends listened to his complaints and nodded one just shook 
his head and observed kuwait was much better than this 
when the wind blows shaalan iii is obliterated by dust the new 
latrines stink from 100 yards away 
but the most desperate refugees describe shaalan iii as 
luxurious compared to shaalan i which still houses about 30000 
indians bangladeshis sri lankans filipinos and other penniless 
refugees 
camp shelters are marked with bits of cardboard torn from boxes 
with inscriptions noting arrival dates going back to late august 
the bare ground is ankle deep in powdery dust and filth nearly 
carpeted with smashed plastic water bottles rotten tomatoes and 
rubber shoes too worn out to save 
on tuesday lunchtime meant a threehour wait in the sun for two 
flat pieces of arab bread a few small tomatoes and a plastic cup 
of yogurt dinner was another wait for similar fare 
we wait for everything said tajdeen rajmuhammed from 
madras india one hour for a liter of water can you wash in one 
liter we walk a kilometer to go the bathroom where no one can see 
us 
mostly they wait for hope each new outsider is besieged with 
questions about buses about other camps about the whereabouts of 
consular officers 
international contributions are in the tens of millions of 
dollars and up to 30 special flights a day carry refugees home 
aide workers blame the huge backup on a combination of factors 
a proud kingdom that called too late for help a united nations 
tangled in red tape impoverished home governments and rich 
nations worried about other aspects of the persian gulf crisis 
most of the refugees have begun appealing directly to television 
news crews that make the sevenhour round trip from amman 
at shaalan ii regarded as a model camp next to the others 
refugees have painted messages on sheet of cardboard affixed to 
tents 
filipinos wrote a message to president corazon aquino we need 
airplanes not sardines 
next to it another reads we dont need promises just get us 
out of here

owereeowes are not cookies hawn 
in the city that natives call bawlmer owereeowes are orioles 
baltimore has a curious mix of southern northern pennsylvania 
dutch appalachian and various immigrant speech patterns and 
bawlmerese is most apparent in its stressed o sound heard in 
words such as oweshun and awl thats ocean and oil 
its not fully northern and not fully southern said allan 
metcalfe executive secretary of the american dialect society 
for example baltimore is on the border of where cot and 
caught are said the same he said 
hon becomes hawn and the highlandtown neighborhood is known as 
hollandtown 
speech pathologist linda katz wilner who helps people rid 
themselves of accents said the peculiar o sound is produced by 
the forced constricted method baltimoreans use to produce vowel 
sounds 
people speak with a very closed mouth a lot of tension in the 
lips wilner said theyre really not even rounding their lips 
its almost a pumping of the jaw 
certain other sounds are reduced wilner said like the 
oi sound in boil people say ball the water its a diphthong 
its supposed to be two sounds and they make it into one for 
example instead of my mother they say mamother 
so next time a hollandtown hawn asks what you want with your 
crab cake say ill have a coweoke but make it quick because 
im going downy oweshun

leaders of exiled iraqi opposition groups 
are meeting in syria to develop a strategy for toppling saddam 
hussein and hope to form a governmentinexile dissident sources 
said tuesday 
about 12 parties and organizations were represented at the 
meeting which began in the syrian capital of damascus in late 
august and is expected to conclude in late september the sources 
said 
were basically trying to produce a political alternative to 
the present regime said a member of the patriotic union of 
kurdistan one of the two main kurdish organizations in an 
interview from london 
the dissident sources all speaking on condition of anonymity 
from paris and london said they hoped the meeting would conclude 
with the formation of an iraqi governmentinexile 
a leader of the iraqi islamic labor party abdelameer kassem 
told the saudi arabian newspaper alyawm that opposition factions 
had also agreed on a joint plan to overthrow the regime of saddam 
hussein 
but in interviews other dissidents said they wanted substantial 
international support before beginning an internal war against 
saddam 
kurds and others would love to open up an internal front 
against saddam but this is not yet it this is not a declaration 
of allout war inside iraq a paris source said 
were fearful of incurring his wrath having him turn his army 
against us without having any outside support 
for decades kurdish guerrillas in northern iraq waged a fierce 
battle for autonomy against saddams troops but in 1988 shortly 
after iraq and iran ended their eightyear war saddam launched an 
offensive against the rebels that included chemical weapons 
it was the first time any government had been reported to have 
used chemical weapons on its own people and it forced the rebels 
to pull back somewhat 
the various kurdish groups opposed to saddam have an estimated 
20000 armed men the patriotic union member said from london the 
kurds were ready to face even the horrors of chemical warfare 
again if we have some guarantees that after saddam is gone well 
have a role in the new government 
one source said theres a lot of potential for making 
trouble for saddam while his attention is turned to his standoff 
with other nations resulting from the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
its not a question of numbers these are trained and 
experienced guerrillas and they could tie up a lot of iraqi troops 
if they chose to do so they have not chosen to do so yet the 
source said 
but the sources said the opposition inside iraq is fragmented 
weak and deep underground and much of the 16 million population 
has been cowed 
during a break in the syrian meeting patriotic union leader 
jalal talabani visited iraqi dissidents living in arab european 
and us cities in a renewed effort to organize the opposition 
these are groups holding very diverse political ideas and the 
circumstances are not easy it may take a little while to produce 
the basic framework of the government wed like to see another

three teenagers who continued to profess their 
innocence received maximum prison sentences of five to 10 years 
today for the rape and assault of a woman jogging in central park 
give me the max one of the defiant youths yusef salaam 
told judge thomas galligan before sentence was passed sooner or 
later the truth will come out 
galligan in turn denounced the three for showing no remorse 
only defiance on the night the jogger was attacked he said 
central park was turned into a torture chamber by mindless 
marauders seeking a thrill 
although the youths were tried as adults because of the 
seriousness of the charges galligan had to sentence them as 
juveniles because they were under 16 when the jogger was attacked 
on april 19 1989 an adult would have faced up to eight and 
onethird to 25 years in prison 
salaam and antron mccray both 16 and raymond santana 15 were 
convicted aug 18 of attacking the woman and assaulting two men the 
same night they were acquitted of the top count of attempted 
murder and a lesser count of sodomy 
the intensity of the violence that occurred that night is 
something no rational mind can explain the judge said 
he denied motions to have the three sentenced in family court 
asking is sexual brutality of a woman something thats 
acceptable or tolerable because it happens at the hands of a 14 or 
15yearold the answer is obvious 
at the hearing william kunstler an attorney for salaam called 
the proceeding a legal lynching 
i dont expect anything to happen here other than the judge to 
sign the maximum he told galligan im so sure of it ive 
already filled out appeal papers 
the teens were accused of raping and trying to kill the jogger 
then 28 during her nightly run in central park she had lost at 
least threefourths of her blood and spent two weeks in a coma a 
doctor said jurors said later they acquitted the youths of the 
attempted murder charge because they were unsure the teens intended 
to kill the woman 
she battled back from her nearfatal injuries eventually 
returning to her wall street firm where she is now a vice 
president she has resumed jogging

brutality but it also became an inspiration to people who followed 
accounts of her recovery

counted 33 youths who entered the park shortly after 9 pm the 
night of the attacks to wild some joggers beat up and rip

three democrats bid for the prize of 
rhode islands democratic nomination for governor tuesday buoyed 
by indications that any of them could defeat republican gov edward 
d diprete 
the three were providence mayor joseph r paolino jr warwick 
mayor francis x flaherty and businessman bruce g sundlun who 
lost to diprete in 1986 and 1988 
diprete also faced a primary but the challenge by former radio 
talk show host steve white was considered minor 
diprete who two years ago enjoyed voter approval ratings 
topping 70 percent is reeling in the polls his approval now 
hovers around 20 percent and is sinking in concert with the new

in the 2nd congressional district democrat edward p beard a 
former hosuepainter whose trademark was the brush he carried in a 
coat pocket on capitol hill from 197580 tried to win his old seat 
back 
he faced a stiff challenge from state sen john f reed who had 
the democratic endorsement lawyer charles gifford iii and state 
rep rodney driver 
in the republican 2nd district primary accountant david 
gingrella tried to portray environmentalist trudy coxe as an 
opportunist who ran only at the governors urging 
the seat is open because republican rep claudine schneider is 
challenging 30year veteran democratic sen claiborne pell

with the democrats smelling dipretes blood they spent 6 
million by labor day in one of the nastiest primary campaigns ever

russias parliament voted overwhelmingly tuesday 
for a radical economic reform program and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev said he favored it over a moderate plan proposed by 
his prime minister 
gorbachevs surprise statement undercut the authority of prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov and added momentum to calls for 
ryzhkovs resignation 
it also increased the chances that the radical plan drafted 
largely by economist stanislav shatalin will go into effect 
throughout the soviet union 
shatalins plan calls for transferring most economic authority 
from the national government to the countrys 15 constituent 
republics the republics could then move rapidly to free prices 
privatize government industries legalize private ownership of land 
and take other steps toward a marketbased economy 
the national supreme soviet legislature and the parliament of 
russia the largest of the 15 republics met separately tuesday to 
consider the competing proposals 
ryzhkov addressed the national legislature in a cavernous marble 
hall at the kremlin the centuriesold walled fortress that is the 
seat of communist power 
he charged that the shatalin plan would lower living standards 
by 30 percent force one out of every four collective farms into 
bankruptcy and cause rapid inflation by decontrolling prices on 
about 75 percent of basic consumer products 
ryzhkov called for retaining central control over the economy 
and making a much slower transition to a marketbased system he 
recommended keeping price controls on most food and household 
products while raising the cost of some major items such as 
televisions radios and refrigerators 
he also said imports of consumer goods and medicines would have 
to be cut by onethird because of a shortage of hard currency and 
he warned that the government budget would have to be cut to 
prevent the 96 billion deficit from ballooning 
ryzhkovs speech caused commotion in the hall as some delegates 
led by anatoly sobchak the reformist mayor of leningrad demanded 
copies of the shatalin plan and the opportunity to adopt it 
if you ask me i like the shatalin plan better gorbachev 
told the delegates in an animated 15minute speech about the need 
to stabilize the soviet economy which is plagued by shortages of 
bread meat paper gasoline tobacco and other ordinary goods 
if there is a real plan to stabilize finances money 
circulation the ruble and the market then we should adopt the 
shatalin idea gorbachev said 
pounding the back of his hand on the lectern the 59yearold 
soviet leader defended the concept of a free market which is 
little understood and much feared by ordinary soviet citizens 
when price controls are gradually lifted he said well have 
real prices that will estimate who is worth what then powerful 
stimuli will be released for structural changes 
of course these will be painful changes but so be it he 
said 
in an auditorium 1 miles away the russian parliament voted 
2131 with four abstentions to adopt the shatalin plan and warned 
that if the national legislature did not follow suit russia would 
proceed on its own 
these are two programs that cannot be combined and cannot even 
supplement each other they proceed from completely different 
political and economic assumptions said boris yeltsin president 
of the russian republic 
and if the soviet union does not follow this program we 
russia as a sovereign state will take this route ourselves he 
said 
russia is one of 13 soviet republics that have declared 
independence or sovereignty defined as the right to overrule 
national laws 
the debates in both the russian parliament and the national 
legislature were punctuated by calls for the resignation of 
ryzhkov 60 and his entire cabinet 
there appeared to be strong support for such a motion in the 
russian parliament especially after yeltsin alleged that the 
current government will not implement this radical reform plan 
they will sabotage it however yeltsin persuaded the delegates 
to wait to see whether the supreme soviet adopts the shatalin plan 
in the national legislature the moves against ryzhkov were 
derailed for the day when the chairman anatoly lukyanov asked for 
a vote on whether to put the prime ministers resignation on the 
agenda 
the motion failed 32828 with 30 abstentions but a delegate 
claimed that if lukyanov had phrased the motion differently to 
call for a vote of no confidence rather than resignation it would 
have passed 
ryzhkov indicated that he might step aside if his plan is 
defeated 
i take responsibility for it before the people and the supreme 
soviet he said 
leading economists and politicians including sobchak have 
urged ryzhkov to step down because of his failure to deal with the 
nations economic problems 
the prime ministers standing also was hurt tuesday by a 
frontpage article in the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda that said 
he had recently bought a luxurious country home or dacha from the 
government for 47000 rubles a fraction of its real worth 
in parliament ryzhkov denied the story saying he did not own a 
dacha but uses one owned by the government

friends of a man who shot himself on the roof 
of a highrise building after a fivehour standoff with police say 
the suicide could have been averted had they been allowed to talk 
with him 
police disagreed 
at least five people said they approached police during fridays 
standoff and asked to speak with paul fisher but werent permitted 
to do so 
if they let one of us up to see him the guy would be alive 
now said dave dietz i feel it in my heart 
police chief mayer deroy said fisher didnt want to talk to 
anyone but deroy and the police officers who were on the roof 
trying to persuade him to surrender allowing friends on the roof 
could have aggravated the situation and endangered the friends the 
chief said 
paul fisher didnt want anyone up there to talk to deroy 
said he made that eminently clear 
fisher 30 of pittsburgh fired at least 11 shots into the air 
from the top of the apartment building during the standoff but no 
one else was struck he left a suicide note saying he hoped to draw 
fire from police 
fishers friends speaking monday at a pub frequented by fisher 
said he would not have hurt them or anyone else 
the friends added they could have spoken to fisher by cellular 
phone without being endangered

a slice of american life was served up to hungry 
muscovites tuesday as pizza hut opened two restaurants in a city 
that is no stranger to shortages 
while housewives queued nearby for scarce foodstuffs and 
consumer goods hundreds of curious young people and families 
waited patiently in line in cool weather for hours to sample 
deeppan pizzas garlic bread pepsi and fare from what was billed 
as the first soviet salad bars 
its a piece of america gushed georg tsukonov a 
20yearold student outside the new pizza hut on kutuzovsky 
prospekt the main road leading west from downtown 
it looks like a museum marveled sailor yevgeni gerko 
gazing at the bright red furnishings brass trim fake tropical 
plants and smiling young waitresses 
a large deeppan super supreme pizza with everything on it 
pepperoni ham spicy pork beef mushrooms onions black olives 
and green peppers emerged from an oven at the restaurant at noon 
marking the official opening 
waiting customers clutching pizza hut flags emblazoned with the 
companys red roof logo the stars and stripes and the hammer and 
sickle oohed and ahhed then excitedly tried to rush the door 
throughout the day pizza hut officials kept the doors locked 
and struggled to limit entrance to only a handful of people at a 
time 
the kutuzovsky site has two identical dining rooms for 
rubleand dollarpaying customers and a takeout counter located 
near a large foreigners compound on the wide boulevard that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev takes to work every day it expects 
to make 5000 pizzas a day 
the smaller pizza hut on gorky street minutes from the kremlin 
has a takeout window selling slices of pizza for rubles 
the moscow menus are similar to those in the west with the 
addition of local favorites like borscht and a moscow seafood 
pizza salmon smoked sardines and onions only nine combination 
pizzas are offered and no substitutions are allowed 
people dont know what the products are said regional 
operations director andy rafalet lets make the choice a little 
easier 
the choice was easy at the salad bar no lettuce but lots of 
cabbage a soviet staple pizza hut claims its the first moscow 
restaurant to serve coleslaw as opposed to pickled cooked or raw 
cabbage 
student irina shushukina said beer was being limited to one 
bottle a person and wine to one bottle per couple 
despite chronic food shortages and a poor food distribution 
system in the soviet union pizza hut said it hopes to buy most of 
its raw ingredients locally including flour for the dough 
the restaurants 300 young employees were hired from 3500 
applicants who replied to an ad in the moscow communist party youth 
newspaper besides learning how to make and serve pizzas most had 
to be taught to smile at customers not snarl or ignore them like 
many moscow restaurant workers 
youll never see so many smiles elsewhere in moscow 
tsukonov said maybe theyre pretending but its fantastic when 
you see people really smile you understand that you are something 
in the world not part of a crowd 
the restaurants are the result of three years negotiations 
even though pizza huts parent company pepsico inc has been doing 
business in the soviet union for decades 
pepsico chairman don kendall cajoled thensoviet premier nikita 
khrushchev into tasting pepsi at a 1959 trade fair photographs of 
khrushchev and thenus vice president richard nixon sipping pepsi 
from paper cups were published in newspapers throughout the world 
pizza hut said it expects to serve 50000 customers a week 
roughly seven times the turnover of any of its american outlets 
mcdonalds which introduced americanstyle fast food to the soviet 
union in january still sells about 5000 burgers an hour 
the restaurants are part of a 3 billion trade deal the largest 
ever signed between the soviet union and a us corporation

the practice of inmates wrestling and 
fighting with tracking dogs at the end of training exercises was 
temporarily halted tuesday by the state prison board 
members of the texas board of criminal justice unanimously 
approved the recommendations of a board subcommittee that the 
contact practice be suspended until inmates have more 
protective gear and policies are in place to ensure that only 
volunteers are used for the exercise 
inmates still would be used in other aspects of dog training 
until now an inmate would be given a head start and go into 
hiding or climb a tree and then when the inmate was located by 
the dog he would briefly fight with the animal 
several prison board members said there was no evidence that the 
dog training exercises had been conducted improperly 
the dog training came under fire after board vice chairman jerry 
hodge took two companions on an inmate hunt for sport 
hodge later had jackets made for them that dubbed the trip the 
ultimate hunt he has since apologized for the jackets but has 
defended the practice of using inmates in the exercise 
the board approved a formal selection system for inmates who 
want to get involved with the dog program with assurances that the 
inmates are not being coerced 
the prison system has about 1000 dogs at various units

irans leaders are tightlipped about 
whether they will help their old adversary iraq break un 
sanctions but analysts believe tehran wont risk international 
outcry even though it wants an agreeable iraq on its border 
after talks with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz the first 
senior official to visit tehran in 15 years the government 
announced monday it would revive full diplomatic relations with its 
former war foe 
aziz is believed to have requested that iran allow food 
medicine and other essential commodities to move across its 
730mile border with iraq in violation of the international embargo 
imposed on baghdad for its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iranian newspapers have argued that the country would not 
violate the sanctions by supplying food and medicine because 
humanitarian aid is permitted under the un security council 
resolution imposing the embargo 
unconfirmed reports from baghdad said the iranians already have 
allowed rice flour and wheat across the northern border 
western analysts believe iranian president hashemi rafsanjani is 
keeping everyone guessing on what iran will do in hopes of striking 
a bargain with the west in return for adhering to the embargo such 
a deal could include financial aid for iran they say 
a diplomat in tehran speaking on condition of anonymity said 
whenever weve tried to analyze their situation logically we 
found we were invariably on the wrong track 
however a western economic expert in tehran also speaking on 
condition of anonymity said smuggling along the frontier was 
difficult to control and was certain to pick up as iranians cash in 
on iraqs burgeoning black market 
anything more substantial than that would be politically and 
economically dangerous for iran because it would give the 
international community the idea that they were subverting un 
sanctions he said 
shaul bakhash a professor of history at washingtons george 
mason university said in a telephone interview it defies logic 
that the iranians would do anything to help iraq consolidate their 
hold over kuwait 
bakhash an iranian exile and former tehran newspaper editor 
has written extensively on iran 
azizs visit and the restoration of full ties came three weeks 
after iraqi president saddam hussein under increasing pressure 
from the buildup of usled forces in the gulf caved in to 
iranian conditions to formally end the nations 198088 war 
iraq granted tehran partial control of its sole access to the 
sea and withdrew its troops from iranian territory seized during 
the war 
the iranians have followed a clever policy of taking 
everything that came their way since the invasion of kuwait said 
another diplomat in tehran but theyre fully aware that if 
saddam were to survive this crisis he would not want to share his 
power in the gulf with anyone and that they could be next on his 
hit list 
he cautioned against forming hard conclusions on iranian 
intentions because it was impossible to speculate on 
behindthescenes maneuvering among members of the countrys ruling 
theocracy 
before iraqs takeover of kuwait iranian foreign exchange 
earnings desperately needed to revive its moribund economy were 
expected to fall short by at least onethird of the 17 billion 
needed in 1990 according to western estimates 
but this was revised sharply upward after the price of oil 
irans principal export item soared following the iraqi invasion 
experts now say revenues could reach 19 billion this year 
that would strengthen rafsanjanis hand against irans radicals 
his political rivals who are bitterly opposed to his reforms and 
efforts to reestablish ties with the west

investigators seeking the killer of 
five college students called for military help tuesday to comb 10 
square miles of woodland where a suspect reportedly went on 
nighttime reconnaissance missions 
authorities would say only that they have a good idea of 
what they are looking for and that the search could strengthen or 
weaken the case against 18yearold university of florida freshman 
edward lewis humphrey 
this is based upon some information that he enjoyed being in 
the woods that he may have camped out and enjoyed being solitary 
in wooded areas said police spokeswoman lt sadie darnell we 
dont want any information to go unchecked 
several hundred members of the florida national guard along 
with reserve army and navy units were being called up to assist in 
the search of several heavily wooded marshy areas around 
humphreys apartment in southwest gainesville 
alachua county sheriffs lt spencer mann said the search could 
begin as early as thursday 
metal detectors dog teams and deepwoods experts also will be 
used 
mann again emphasized that humphrey is only one of eight 
suspects in the five gruesome slayings of the students four were 
enrolled at the university of florida the fifth victim was a 
student at santa fe community college 
this search does not denote that edward humphrey is the 
suspect and the only suspect he said a lot of resources have 
been poured into suspects just as important as him 
humphrey became a suspect in the slayings through a canvass of 
the offcampus student apartment areas where the victims lived 
people told investigators humphrey was a volatile person with 
emotional problems who wore military fatigues had a fascination 
for knives and went into the woods on nighttime reconnaissance 
missions police have said 
humphrey was jailed in lieu of 11 million bail in brevard 
county on charges in the aug 30 beating of his grandmother an 
october 1988 armed burglary and attempted rape in indian river 
county and an aug 25 assault on two male uf students 
genetic tests were being run on blood and semen samples 
the dna analysis could take weeks police said 
police balked at saying the semen indicated the victims had been 
sexually assaulted 
the nude mutilated bodies of sonya larson 18 and christina 
powell 17 were found aug 26 in their apartment the next 
morning christa hoyt 18 was found decapitated in her nearby 
duplex manuel taboada and tracy paules both 23 were found dead 
aug 28 in another nearby apartment 
investigators have described the killer as shrewd and 
methodical they have reportedly said he left taunting messages 
to them arranged body parts at the slaying scene for maximum shock 
value and enjoyed the power hes had over the life of this college 
town

a bipartisan study commission on monday urged 
congress not to impose new antiobscenity restrictions on the 
national endowment for the arts declaring that americans must 
put up with much we do not like to preserve freedom of artistic 
expression 
the 12member panel also urged nea chairman john e frohnmayer 
to scrap a controversial requirement that grant recipients sign a 
pledge that they will not use federal money to produce works that 
might be deemed obscene 
frohnmayer has repeatedly resisted demands that he eliminate the 
pledge which has created a furor in the arts community until 
federal courts rule on lawsuits challenging its constitutionality 
he refused comment on the commissions report 
at the same time the commission proposed a major overhaul of 
the endowments grantmaking procedures to ensure that the nea 
serves the interests of the american public and not a narrow 
constituency of artists 
the panel concluded that the endowment is not in setting 
policy and making grants adequately meeting its public 
responsibilities at the present time as steward of taxpayer funds 
it proposed that the nea chairman be given sole explicit 
authority to make final grant decisions and that the growing power 
of peer review panels that select grant applications for 
approval be diminished to an advisory role 
the 94page report of the commission established by congress 
last fall drew mixed reviews from lawmakers trying to negotiate a 
compromise bill that would extend the endowments life beyond sept 
30 when its statutory authority expires 
rep tom coleman rmo applauded the report as a possible 
framework for a compromise but criticized the panel for rejecting 
his proposal to shift as much as 60 percent of federal grant money 
to the control of state arts agencies 
coleman also served notice that the house probably will ignore 
the commissions plea and approve some sort of ban on federal 
subsidies for pornographic or blasphemous art even if it only 
embraces the supreme courts guidelines on obscenity 
the commission appointed by president bush and the house and 
senate leadership said it unanimously opposed legislative curbs on 
the content of works financed by the arts endowment 
content restrictions may raise serious constitutional issues 
would be inherently ambiguous and would almost certainly involve 
the endowment and the department of justice in costly and 
unproductive lawsuits the panel said 
instead it suggested that congress approve a preamble to 
the nea reauthorization bill declaring simply that the endowment 
serves all of the people and reflects the high place the 
nation accords to the fostering of mutual respect for the disparate 
beliefs and values among us 
the commission added maintaining the principle of an open 
society requires all of us at times to put up with much we do not 
like but the bargain has proved in the long run a good one 
the independent panel was created in october to examine nea 
operations at the same time at the urging of sen jesse helms 
rnc congress amended the endowments 171 million budget to 
prohibit using federal funds for works that may be considered 
obscene 
conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists were 
angered by nea grants for exhibitions of works by photographer 
robert mapplethorpe which contained sexually graphic images and 
by artist andres serrano which they denounced as sacrilegious 
the commissions report concluded with an appeal for a dampening 
of the emotionalism and partisan sniping over the endowment which 
cochairman leonard garment a washington lawyer called an 
american treasure very much worth preserving 
there are many individuals on both sides of the current debate 
who think the endowment a convenient and newsworthy vehicle to 
advance their own objectives the panel said 
some do not care a great deal about whether the agency 
survives america has had more than enough of this uncompromising 
kind of behavior

i am proud of my service in the public and private sectors 
robert j thompson told the senate judiciary subcommittee on 
business rights i would do nothing to dishonor this record i 
have done nothing to dishonor this record 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio chairman of the subcommittee 
said lobbyists practice of selling access to government officials 
goes directly to the heart of the simmering frustration people 
are feeling about washington and its ways as well as the boiling 
outrage they are expressing about the savings and loan debacle 
metzenbaum and other senators questioned thompson about what he 
did to help james fail a phoenix investor take over the 15 texas 
savings and loans for a 1000 cash outlay and win well over 18 
billion in federal subsidies 
as a result of those subsidies metzenbaum said the bluebonnet 
savings bank of dallas that grew out of the takeover is the 
nations most profitable savings and loan 
metzenbaum suggested fail bought thompsons assistance because 
of thompsons associations with high officials 
sen orrin hatch rutah asked whether there was anything out 
of the ordinary in how he dealt on behalf of fail 
no sir nothing at all thompson replied the process 
that resulted in the creation of the bluebonnet savings bank was 
conducted with and supervised by officials of the federal 
government and i fully followed all rules of propriety 
he added i feel very strongly one reason i am here was that i 
used to work for george bush thompson was an adviser to bush 
when he was vice president and also served for a time as an 
assistant to president reagan 
if bluebonnet continues to prosper thompson and his company 
stand to gain in addition to their retainer and hourly fees 2 
percent of fails earnings from the savings and loan plus a 
160000 bonus 
the subcommittee began looking into fails takeover after 
disclosures that he was able to do it with only 1000 cash out of 
pocket and 70 million of loans from insurance companies he 
controlled during the investigation the panel learned that fail 
had not disclosed that he had entered a guilty plea to a fraud 
indictment against one of his corporations 
federal regulators have testified since that the plea should 
have disqualified fail from taking over the savings and loans 
those regulators led by m danny wall who headed the nowdefunct 
federal home loan bank board said they did nothing special for 
thompson 
weve learned enough about the bluebonnet deal to know that 
all was not negotiated on the up and up metzenbaum said if 
regulators subjected other takeover deals completed in 1988 to the 
same scrutiny given bluebonnet and took appropriate action he 
said billions of dollars will be recouped for the us 
treasury

a district court on tuesday sentenced a 
19yearold soviet hijacker to four years in prison 
mikhail mokretsov had surrendered to police after forcing a 
domestic soviet airliner to stockholm in july 
the prosecutor asked that mokretsov be expelled to the soviet 
union after serving his sentence the court rejected the plea 
saying mokretsov was only 18yearsold at the time of the hijacking 
and that it was unlikely he would commit other crimes in sweden 
thomas rothpfeffer mokretsovs attorney said he was 
satisfied and relieved that the court decided not to expel his 
client but he said the sentence was too harsh considering his 
clients age and the circumstances 
mokretsov was one of three young soviets who hijacked airliners 
to sweden in june and july courts extradited the other two 
soviets saying sweden should not become a haven for hijackers 
for humanitarian reasons mokretsov was not sent back he had 
gone on a hunger strike saying he would rather die in sweden than 
be jailed in the soviet union

three defiant teenagers including one who 
challenged the judge to give me the max received maximum 
sentences tuesday of five to 10 years in prison for the rape and 
assault of a woman jogger in central park 
judge thomas galligan denounced the three for showing only 
defiance he described them as mindless marauders seeking a 
thrill who turned the park into a torture chamber 
although the seriousness of the charges allowed the youths to be 
tried as adults galligan had to sentence them as juveniles because 
they were under age 16 when the jogger was attacked an adult would 
have faced up to eight and onethird to 25 years in prison 
if their appeals fail the youths will be eligible for parole in 
five years 
yusef salaam and antron mccray each 16 and raymond santana 
15 were convicted aug 18 of attacking the woman and assaulting 
two men during a wilding spree that night they were acquitted 
of the top count of attempted murder and a lesser count of sodomy 
the jogger an investment banker was attacked on april 19 
1989 while running in a relatively isolated section of central 
park 
race she was white her alleged attackers were black or 
hispanic and the citys growing concern with street crime made 
the case a sensation 
the woman then 28 suffered brain damage lost at least 
threefourths of her blood and spent two weeks in a coma doctors 
said the woman whose name has been left out of news reports 
testified that she has continuing vision balance and other 
problems and has no memory of the attack 
she battled back from her nearfatal injuries eventually 
returning to her wall street firm where she is now a vice 
president she also has resumed jogging 
each of the youths addressed the court before galligan sentenced 
them 
salaam was the most defiant he read a rambling rapstyle poem 
he said he had composed in jail before he was bailed out 
i look upon this legal lynching as a test by my god allah 
he told galligan i and many others know i told the truth i 
would never disrespect my own religion by lying 
give me the max he said sooner or later the truth will 
come out 
mccray told the judge im not going to let this stop me im 
going to make it 
santana whose tone was the mildest said simply everyone 
knows im innocent of the crime i never did it 
before he announced the sentence galligan said that the 
intensity of the violence that occurred that night is something no 
rational mind can explain 
he denied motions to have the three sentenced in family court 
saying is sexual brutality of a woman something thats 
acceptable or tolerable because it happens at the hands of a 14 or 
15yearold the answer is obvious 
salaam had a new attorney at the sentencing william kunstler 
who implied that the defendants videotaped confessions were 
coerced we all know what black youths in back rooms will say to 
white cops 
i dont expect anything to happen here other than the judge to 
sign the maximum he told galligan im so sure of it ive 
already filled out appeal papers 
during the trial a detective testified that santana told him he 
counted 33 youths who entered the park the night of the attacks to 
wild some joggers beat up and rip off joggers and 
cyclists 
mccray said on videotape that when the youths saw the jogger 
during her nightly sixmile run we all charged her 
he said she struggled and screamed while several teenagers 
dragged her down a wooded slope into the darkness 
on his tape santana admitted holding and kicking the woman and 
feeling her breasts while others raped her 
mccray said he kicked her then held for the others when it was 
his turn mccray said he feigned the sex act to impress his 
buddies 
the defendants told detectives the naked woman was struck with a 
metal pipe bashed in the head and face with a brick cut on the 
legs with a knife and sexually attacked in a frenzy of violence 
prosecutors said 
galligan has set a trial date of oct 11 for two other 
defendants kharey wise 18 and kevin richardson 15 another 
defendant steve lopez 15 will be tried separately next year

east germanys nuclear power industry 
costs too much to run and has little chance of survival after 
unification west germanys environment minister said tuesday 
the minister klaus toepfer repeated earlier assessments that 
east german nuclear standards are below those of the west 
he told a bonn news conference it would be an expensive and long 
procedure to bring the east german plants up to european standards 
the soviet union had supplied east germany with the technology 
to build nuclear power plants 
east germany has one operating reactor at a plant at greifswald 
in the northern part of the country construction at another 
nuclear power plant has been halted 
faulty design and human error were responsible for the 1985 
chernobyl nuclear disaster in the soviet union it caused extreme 
panic in west germany where the antinuclear movement is very 
strong 
east germany derives 10 percent of its electricity from nuclear 
power

1983 said tuesday he was glad his father was thrown back into 
prison on parole violation charges eight months after his release 
i was just glad they caught him and he was a couple hundred 
miles away said 14yearold david rothenberg he learned of 
mondays news when his mother picked him up from the high school he 
attends 
if they didnt catch him id be scared but i think after 
this he should be put in prison for life david said 
charles rothenberg was headed to a job interview in oakland on 
monday when he ducked out of a doughnut shop and eluded a parole 
agent who was watching him rothenberg was picked up without 
resistance four hours later 
he deliberately violated his parole said tipton kindel a 
spokesman for the california department of corrections we dont 
know why he would jeopardize what freedom he had to live on the 
outside but it was a big mistake on his part 
rothenberg 50 will remain at san quentin prison until a 
hearing which must be held within 60 days kindel said if it is 
found there was a violation he could be sentenced to 30 days to a 
year 
rothenberg was placed on three years parole after he served six 
years and five months of his 13year sentence 
he was convicted of attempted murder arson and other charges 
for pouring kerosene over his son and setting the boy on fire 
david who was 6 at the time was severely disfigured from 
thirddegree burns over 90 percent of his body the 1988 abctv 
movie david depicted the attack 
rothenberg and the boys mother were living separately in new 
york rothenberg took the boy to california for a vacation and set 
fire to david after his wife told him in a telephone conversation 
that he would not be able to see the boy again 
after rothenberg left prison in january at least one parole 
officer followed him at all times he described himself as the 
mostwatched man in america 
kindel said rothenberg had not caused any problem during his 
parole before monday hed been abiding by the rules keeping a 
low profile and trying to obtain employment kindel said 
after slipping out of the doughnut shop rothenberg phoned 
another agent to say he would go to a scheduled job interview when 
he arrived about 1130 am he was arrested

rep jerry costello finally heard from his son 
last week it was a note about the sun and sand on the other side 
of the world in saudi arabia 
the illinois democrats 21yearold son army paratrooper jerry 
costello ii is a member of the us military force in the middle 
east a job that makes the persian gulf crisis a personal one for 
the congressman and his family 
in advance of president bushs speech to congress tuesday on the 
mideast situation costello said he would be listening with special 
interest 
ill be thinking about one soldier over there in particular 
costello said 
his son has been abroad for more than a month but like many 
other families the father heard from the son only a few days ago 
basically the message was the conditions are not the 
greatest costello said but hes doing as well as the other 
soldiers he spent 95 percent of the letter telling us not to worry 
when he sleeps the soldiers try to get to the closest piece 
of concrete because the concrete is cooler at night it took him a 
little while to get adjusted to the heat costello said 
while theyre working long hours he added its still 
very boring the major problem they are confronting right now is 
sitting in limbo not knowing whats going to happen 
costellos son is in the armys 82nd airborne based at fort 
bragg nc 
the congressman said the army had refused to confirm his sons 
deployment but when thousands of paratroopers were sent to the 
persian gulf in early august he was certain jerry ii was part of 
the group 
the letter reached the familys belleville ill home thursday 
costello said his daily routine hasnt changed much but he and 
his wife georgia watch a lot of news as they try to catch the 
developments in the middle east 
constituents in his district have given him and his family a 
very warm response 
on labor day i walked in two parades and it was very touching 
for me to hear the support costello said in a grocery store 
a gasoline station people just want us to know theyre keeping 
our son in their prayers 
although hes in congress costello said his position doesnt 
give him an advantage over others worried about sons daughters or 
spouses sent to the region 
several lawmakers have visited the soldiers in saudi arabia but 
costello said he did not ask them to do any favors for his family 
as a courtesy however he was invited two weeks ago to a white 
house briefing held by bush 
costello recently bid farewell to about 200 soldiers deployed 
from scott air force base which is in his district 
it was important for the parents to know they are not the only 
ones affected costello said their us congressman is too

lobstermen are feuding again in the rich 
lobsterfishing areas of casco bay and in one dispute two 
fishermen were tossed in the harbor a gun was brandished and a 
boat damaged 
its a territorial dispute maine marine patrol lt joseph 
fessenden said tuesday its a situation where theres a limited 
area of space to fish 
the lobstermen are competing for the same area and weve had a 
situation where theyve been cutting each others traps he said 
there have been several lobstermen whove lost several thousand 
dollars worth of traps this has been happening throughout the 
summer 
discontent has been high among maines estimated 4000 fulltime 
lobstermen strikes throughout the summer protested prices being 
paid for lobster catches 
softshell lobsters often have sold for as low as 175 to 185 
a pound wholesale this summer said bob brown president of the 
maine importexport lobster dealers association he said this price 
resulted from supply and demand maine harvested about 22 million 
pounds of lobster in 1988 24 million in 1989 and this years 
prediction is 26 million pounds 
under pressure to maintain their income the dozen boat crews 
feuding in portland harbor have been suspicious of others taking 
more than their fair share fessenden said 
they call this area the bay of pigs and this is one of the 
reasons he said 
lobstermen have their own specially marked buoys attached to a 
line of lobster traps every day they travel through their 
territory stopping at each of their buoys to haul up their lines 
empty the traps put in new bait and dump them back in the water 
on monday a dispute between the captains of two boats the bampb 
and the rambler turned violent in what fessenden described as the 
worst confrontation he has seen in 15 years as a marine patrol 
officer 
fessenden said the bampb pulled alongside the rambler as its 
captain matthew chipman 28 of portland was trying to pull up a 
string of traps that had been cut 
norman solak 52 a longtime lobsterman from west buxton and 
one of his crew edward mains jr 36 of gorham boarded the 
rambler fessenden said 
the two crews struggled he said and solak and mains were 
thrown into the harbor 
fessenden said the ramblers crew charged later in a radio call 
to the coast guard that one of the bampbs crew brandished a gun 
the marine patrol and the coast guard confiscated three weapons 
from the bampb a 30caliber rifle a 22caliber handgun and a 
38caliber handgun 
one of the boats also was damaged in the confrontation said a 
marine patrol officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
fessenden said the marine patrol is investigating whether to 
file criminal charges against the crews involved 
its highly illegal to molest another mans gear said david 
dow executive director of the lobster institute a cooperative 
research program at the university of maine at orono its an 
automatic threeyear license suspension for anybody caught doing 
it 
but territoriality has been around for as long as anybody can 
remember dow said its rare that you see a territorial 
dispute flare up in this overt fashion most of the territorial 
disputes are only handled in the thick fog and the black of night

west germanys intelligence agency cannot 
freely pore over the files of 6 million east germans compiled by 
the former communist regime both nations agreed tuesday 
however officials did not decide if the files could be moved to 
what is now west germany an issue that has obsessed east germans 
as they prepare to unite with their western neighbor oct 3 
about 22 activists some of whom helped lead the peaceful revolt 
that toppled the communist regime last autumn have been occupying 
the building where the files are kept 
they are demanding that east germans get to see information kept 
on them by the former secret police known as the stasi and that 
the files remain in east german territory 
top officials from both germanys agreed tuesday only that the 
records will not be merged with those of the west german secret 
service 
the stasi files may not be used as regular working materials 
by the secret service said guenther krause top aide to east 
german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
krause spoke after a meeting with rudolf seiters west german 
chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff and west german interior 
minister wolfgang schaueble 
a treaty laying the groundwork for unification calls for the 
fate of the files to be decided by a united parliament being 
elected dec 2 
critics say that ultimately will mean that west germans who 
will dominate the new government will have the final say over the 
secret records of east germans east germanys parliament has yet 
to vote on the unity treaty and many lawmakers are demanding a 
change in that provision 
any rule allowing east germans to look at files must also apply 
to west germans krause said since 2 million western citizens are 
believed to have files in the stasi archives 
krause said the possibility of destroying files also must be 
discussed and that he believed an overall agreement could be 
reached this week 
the files give a glimpse of a nation in the grip of a paranoid 
oppressive regime and contain intimate details of the personal 
lives of both prominent people and average citizens 
because each file on one individual could contain up to 60 other 
names some officials are worried that granting someone access to a 
file will give him or her information about many others 
western intelligence agencies are believed to be anxious to 
disseminate the information compiled by the stasi which of all 
communist intelligence agencies was second only to the soviet kgb 
in skill and global reach 
there have been reports however that some of the most 
sensitive records were destroyed by the stasi in the waning days of 
the former communist regime 
east german interior minister petermichael diestel constantly 
under fire for the scores of former stasi employees still working 
in his agency fired eight exsecret police officials on tuesday 
according to the east german news agency adn 
six of them were on a list published during the weekend of 150 
reputed former stasi agents still working in the government the 
list was published by the west german tabloid bild 
fourteen people on the list purportedly worked in the east 
german press center and the office of government spokesman matthias 
gehler gehler said tuesday that four are no longer with the press 
department and 10 have been given leaves of absence

a swiss bank will guarantee part of the 375 
million philadelphia is seeking to keep from going broke but not 
as much as city officials had hoped 
swiss bank corp said monday it will back 50 million of the 
temporary loan notes the administration of mayor w wilson goode is 
trying to sell to raise cash 
we could be willing to take 50 million and to the extent we 
got other banks to guarantee other portions of the loan the 
amount of the letter of credit would go up from there said john 
p chamales swiss bank first vice president 
the bank was prepared to issue a letter of credit for as much as 
225 million if other banks assume the risk for the other 175 
million he said 
a letter of credit would guarantee the notes will be repaid and 
would aid the city in marketing the loan notes 
the city would have to pay higher interest on notes issued 
without a guarantee 
city officials and a financial team headed by merrill lynch 
capital markets were trying to persuade at least two other banks to 
guarantee additional notes 
quoting unidentified sources the philadelphia inquirer said 
tuesday city leaders are talking with union bank of switzerland and 
national westminister bank of london about joining swiss bank 
four local banks last week rejected a city request that each of 
them guarantee 15 million in notes 
the mayor has said the city will be out of cash by late this 
month unless it receives a cash infusion the notes would be repaid 
from property and business tax receipts expected early next year 
even with the temporary notes the city projects a 2064 
million deficit in the 21 billion general fund budget by june 30 
1991

barbara bush says kitty dukakis would have 
made a great first lady and deserves credit for writing so 
frankly about her personal struggle with drugs and alcohol 
mrs bush praised the massachusetts governors wife for writing 
a very painful book with no meanness 
the first lady said she read mrs dukakis autobiography now 
you know cover to cover in a dayandahalf on her maine 
vacation 
she tried to write about a really big problem she had very 
honestly and very sincerely without casting blame on her 
politician husband or anyone else mrs bush said 
dukakis was the democrats losing candidate in the 1988 
presidential contest against bush 
she loves her husband said mrs bush she looked all 
around for someone to blame and she blamed herself and she says it 
would have happened win or lose with any little thing that had 
come up 
i think she would have made a great first lady said mrs 
bush who has sent mrs dukakis a note expressing those sentiments 
the book makes you also think hes a pretty nice fellow she 
said softly 
people wonder how he could not have not known she said 
but defending dukakis she added ive known a lot of people 
who had this problem and the truth is men or women dont want to 
know and the other truth is that addicted people hide alcoholics 
can hide it 
people have to understand that those things are not just 
obvious to the person whos married to them it should be but 
isnt said mrs bush 
she said kitty dukakis story puts the lie to the notion that 
an addicted person cant produce 
i remember george had someone work in his office a thousand 
years ago that he discovered was an alcoholic hed produced for 
years said mrs bush

all he went home with the man to tell his wife which was over and 
above and beyond the line of duty she said his wife said

shoe to fall

seeds that some had feared might produce 
mutated killer tomatoes after nearly six years in space have been 
vindicated they produced fruit that won first prize at the kansas 
state fair 
six tomatoes grown from seeds that were part of a national 
aeronautics and space administration experiment beat more than 
three dozen other entries 
kansas cosmosphere planetarium director roger hoefer grew the 
tomatoes the space museum in the central kansas town of hutchinson 
received seeds from nasa to show teachers how to do class projects 
with them 
ive grown tomatoes all of my life and ive never grown 
tomatoes as pretty as these were hoefer said 
when he entered the plate of six rutgers tomatoes he noticed 
some other entries dwarfed his rutgers named after the university 
where the variety was developed years ago is an old stable but 
small tomato 
but the judge looked not for size but for conformity uniformity 
of shape and ripeness and freedom from skin blemishes and defects 
hoefers space tomatoes were among the 10 plates of entries the 
judge separated immediately from the rest closer examination put 
hoefers entry in first in saturdays judging 
hoefer didnt learn of the results until monday 
i couldnt believe it he said i looked down and they had 
a blue ribbon on them 
more that 12 million seeds were on a satellite sent into orbit 
in 1984 for 10 months of exposure to the radiation of space the 
idea was to test the durability of possible space station building 
materials and to see if the radiation would cause mutations in the 
tomatoes 
but instead of 10 months the satellite wasnt retrieved until 
after nearly six years 
the seeds were distributed to 4 million students and others 
nationwide for planting 
controversy erupted when a nasa contractor warned there was a 
remote possibility the seeds might produce toxic fruit some 
teachers dropped the plant project nasa suggested the tomatoes not 
be eaten 
but hoefer said cosmosphere employees and volunteers have been 
eating the tomatoes all summer 
hoefer and chuck marr a kansas state university horticulturist 
who supervised the tomato competition agreed that growing 
conditions and care had more to do with the prize tomatoes than the 
fact their seeds spent time in space hoefer grew his in a 
greenhouse 
hoefer said control plants grown from seeds of the same variety 
that stayed on earth yielded equal quality fruit 
he said two plants showed abnormalities one had unusual blossom 
clusters and produced small elongated tomatoes the fruit had poor 
flavor and few seeds another plant also had odd blossoms and in 
one instance produced a peasize tomato that never ripened 
hoefer is keeping the odd plants alive in case scientists at 
nasa or park seed co of greenwood sc want to do tissue tests 
to looked for genetic damage

the saudi government has complained 
to the us military about the growing number of american troops 
visiting saudi towns toting weapons officials said tuesday 
saudi and us officials sought to play down the significance of 
the formal complaint but it came amid growing signs the american 
presence is causing cultural strains 
we of course welcome the americans and appreciate their 
assistance but there needs to be more sensitivity a saudi 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity there is no 
need to carry weapons into town and we are asking that they not do 
this 
a military spokesman navy capt michael sherman said all 
american military personnel had been instructed to when possible 
wear civilian clothes while visiting saudi towns and not to carry 
weapons 
he said the instructions will be circulated again in light of 
the saudi complaint but sherman said it is inevitable that some 
troops sent into town suddenly or on certain official business 
would bring their weapons 
there is a terrorist threat and these people should be able to 
defend themselves he said but we want to keep that to a 
minimum 
for the first few weeks of the american deployment it was rare 
to see uniformed us military personnel in saudi towns but in the 
past 10 days many units have sent troops into a few towns for 
supplies they have been unable to get from the military those 
soldiers often wander through streets and shops carrying m16 
rifles and other weapons 
that prompted a number of recent complaints from saudis to the 
government of the kingdoms eastern province the northeastern 
sector of the country where most american troops are deployed 
some shopkeepers say the armed americans scare people away and 
officials say the constant presence of weapons is heightening fears 
that war is imminent 
we have asked that they leave their machine guns behind when 
they go into town said the saudi official 
another saudi official said the eastern province government also 
has been questioned in recent days about american military women 
driving in the streets women are prohibited from driving in saudi 
arabia 
they are inquiries rather than complaints said the 
official who also spoke on the condition he not be identified 
us military officials have said women would be confined to 
driving on military installations and in their camps but there 
have been occasions when women have been seen driving military 
vehicles in saudi towns 
the complaint and inquiries were not entirely unexpected 
saudi and american officials have said some conflicts are 
inevitable as about 100000 american troops deployed since iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 begin living in an islamic culture 
these officials said they have been pleasantly surprised that 
such incidents have been kept to a minimum 
but in recent days there have been other signs of strain as well 
in the relations between the american military and their saudi 
hosts 
many military decisions are deferred to the saudis because of 
their sovereignty but americans have been irritated by a few 
public statements by saudi officials that the americans have viewed 
as bragging about controlling the us troops 
american field commanders are irate that they have not been 
allowed to conduct livefire testing of major weapons systems such 
as m1 tanks and hellfire antitank missiles these and other 
systems are untested in combat and commanders believe some field 
firing is essential to determine if desert conditions will affect 
their weaponsguidance systems 
the saudis according to us military sources have discouraged 
the live firing because they do not want to upset or endanger local 
residents particularly desertroaming bedouins or face criticism 
within the arab world for allowing the united states to show off 
its military might 
this dispute appears headed for resolution the saudis have 
given permission for test firing of lighter weapons perhaps as 
early as this week and say they are seeking to resolve concerns 
over firing the heavier weapons 
in another incident that prompted private criticism from saudis 
a m16 rifle leaned against a wall in a hotel restaurant slipped 
and fell to the floor startling saudis and kuwaitis in the 
restaurant 
sherman said military personnel have been asked to leave their 
weapons at a military office at the hotel if they are going into

uninsured patients and those on medicaid were 
less likely to receive three common treatments for heart disease 
than those with insurance a study of 37994 people in 
massachusetts has found 
the study examined the care of heart disease patients admitted 
to more than 100 massachusetts hospitals in 1985 
researchers looked at three common but expensive treatments 
angiography used to diagnose heart disease and bypass grafting 
and angioplasty procedures to treat blocked coronary arteries 
we found that the odds that privately insured patients 
received angiography were 80 percent higher than uninsured 
patients the odds were 40 percent higher for bypass grafting and 
28 percent higher for angioplasty the authors wrote in 
wednesdays journal of the american medical association 
medicaid patients experienced odds similar to those of 
uninsured patients for receiving angiography and bypass but had 48 
percent lower odds of receiving angioplasty they wrote 
this is very disturbing dr mark wenneker a health policy 
researcher at new england medical center in boston said tuesday 
its very possible that the uninsured and medicaid people 
needed these procedures and didnt get them but we dont know 
that said wenneker the lead researcher 
on the other hand equally disturbing is the possibility that 
there may have been no difference in what happened to insured 
versus the uninsured which raises the question of whether these 
procedures were actually even necessary wenneker said in a 
telephone interview 
in an angiography dye is injected into coronary arteries to 
determine if there is any blockage 
if blockage is found an openheart bypass operation may be 
done grafting a vessel from another part of the body to bypass the 
blockage and allow enough blood to reach the heart 
angioplasty is an alternative operation in which a small balloon 
is inflated inside the blocked vessel to push the clot into the 
vessel wall and reduce the blockage 
angiography and angioplasty each generally cost more than 
1000 while bypass operations usually cost several thousand 
dollars wenneker said 
the three are considered definitive procedures necessary to 
diagnose and treat heart disease wenneker said 
the researchers however did not examine the patients outcomes 
to see if any of them might have died or their conditions worsened 
after not receiving the procedures wenneker said 
they also did not determine whether it was the decision of the 
physician hospital or patient to forgo the procedures 
their study did conclude that the patients insurance status was 
a major factor and that the procedures were done less often on 
those with lower incomes and it suggests that quality of care may 
depend on a patients insurance status 
although the central mission of many hospitals was once the 
provision of charity care rising costs and an increasingly 
competitive health care marketplace have influenced the willingness 
of hospitals to care for uninsured patients the researchers 
wrote 
in an accompanying editorial dr james todd the amas 
executive vice president said changes are needed in the financing 
and delivering of health care to make sure treatment does not 
depend on economics 
many hypotheses could be advanced to explain these differences 
but all would raise the issue that the volume and location of care 
seem related to the availability of funding todd wrote 
the medical profession stands ready to participate in any 
program that brings equity to the system he said it does not 
stand ready to abandon its advocacy for patients in the name of 
expediency

the deficit in the countrys broadest measure 
of foreign trade rose slightly in the apriljune quarter to 2184 
billion still the secondbest showing in six years the government 
reported tuesday 
however private economists forecast that the deficit will head 
sharply higher in the months ahead as the persian gulf crisis 
boosts americas foreign oil bill and cuts into americans overseas 
earnings 
the commerce department report showed that the nations current 
account trade deficit was up a slight 08 percent from a first 
quarter gap of 2167 billion which had been the best showing 
since a 212 billion deficit in the first three months of 1984 
the current account is the most important trade statistic 
because it measures not only trade in merchandise but also in 
services and investment flows between countries 
the strong showing in the second quarter resulted from a record 
level of us merchandise sales balancing a deterioration in 
investment earnings which went into deficit for the first time in 
a year 
analysts forecast that the deficit for the rest of this year 
would rise as a result of the crisis in the middle east 
under their scenario higher oil prices will boost americas 
import bill while slower worldwide growth as a result of the 
turmoil will cut down on american export sales as well as dampen 
overseas earnings by us companies 
our economy is now tied more than ever to foreign growth 
slower growth overseas will reduce demand for us exports and 
reduce our earnings on overseas investments said stephen cooney 
director of international investment for the national association 
of manufacturers 
david wyss senior financial economist at drimcgraw hill said 
the trade deficit could widen by 25 percent in coming months 
because of the fallout from the persian gulf that forecast would 
represent a blow to bush administration hopes for a continued 
strong trade performance to bolster a weak domestic economy 
wyss predicted the trade deficit would start narrowing again by 
the second half of next year as oil prices begin to come down but 
he said this estimate was dependent on events in the persian gulf 
if shooting starts then oil prices go higher and the trade 
deficit gets a lot worse he said 
for the second quarter the merchandise trade deficit narrowed a 
sharp 141 percent to 226 billion reflecting a big drop in oil 
prices and a record level of exports 
the surplus in the services account which reflects such things 
as tourism and payments for services running from architects to 
lawyers totaled 608 billion up 13 percent from the first 
quarter 
however these improvements were offset by the fact that the 
investment category moved into deficit for the first time in a 
year the deficit in the second quarter was 637 million compared 
to a surplus of 20 billion in the first quarter 
the other category in the current account unilateral transfers 
such as foreign aid and pension payments to americans living 
overseas showed a deficit of 471 billion in the second quarter 
39 percent larger than the first quarter deficit 
even with the improvement in the first six months the united 
states started the 1990s in a vastly different position from a 
decade earlier 
then america was the largest creditor nation it ran surpluses 
in its current account as the earnings on its overseas investments 
were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade 
but as americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners 
to pay for imported merchandise the investment cushion eroded and 
disappeared altogether in 1985 when the united states became a net 
debtor for the first time in 71 years 
that means that foreigners now own more in us assets than 
americans own overseas a development which has led some to fear 
america is losing control of its economic destiny to foreigners 
at the end of 1989 the countrys net debtor position was put at 
6637 billion up a sharp 25 percent from the previous year many 
analysts believe it will hit 1 trillion before beginning to 
improve

of the bar he was on when he pleaded innocent tuesday to three 
charges that he knowingly received stolen antiques and burglarized 
a house 
your honor at this time the people santa clara county 
assistant district attorney alan w nudelman began apparently 
forgetting he was the accused 
pardon me he told municipal court judge jean westenkamp 
i would enter a plea of not guilty to all charges 
the judge set oct 10 for the next court appearance for 
nudelman a date for a preliminary hearing will be set at that time

after allegedly buying a sink and a desk from a suspected burglar 
the transaction was secretly videotaped by officers 
nudelman 45 has said he didnt know the items were stolen 
the only comment that i have is that alan nudelman has 
committed no crime and therefore expects to be completely 
exonerated said his attorney kenneth w robinson 
police said they obtained nudelmans permission before they 
searched his los gatos home and found more than 70 allegedly stolen 
items 
deputy attorney general michael oreilley contended that about 
50 of those items belong to an 87yearold woman whose home and

israel on tuesday welcomed its 100000th 
immigrant this year the latest newcomer in a flood that has proved 
a mixed blessing for the jewish state 
the immigrants almost 90 percent soviets are helping to build 
israels jewish population and fulfilling the national goal of 
the ingathering of the exiles but the wave of immigration the 
largest since the early days of the state is severely straining 
resources 
just slightly larger than new jersey and with a population of 
about 45 million israel is grappling with how to resettle the 
150000 soviet jews expected this year and the 1 million who could 
arrive by the decades end 
absorption minister yitzhak peretz on tuesday predicted that a 
total number of immigrants this year may reach 200000 
housing shortages already have developed unemployment is rising 
and the budget deficit is soaring 
michael kleiner chairman of the parliaments absorption 
committee estimates israel will need to spend 30 billion over the 
next four to five years to resettle the newcomers 
we will have to readjust our national spending tap world 
jewry and israels other foreign friends take out loans anything 
we can think of to cover the costs kleiner said 
peretz went to tel avivs ben gurion airport to greet the 
100000th immigrant of 1990 he was yitzhak krasiltchik 80 a 
native of the soviet city of leningrad who arrived on a flight 
with 140 other soviet jews via warsaw 
krasiltchik who walks with a cane was helped into a limosine 
at the foot of the jets ramp and ferried to the arrivals lounge 
where he was serenaded by israeli children carrying colorful 
balloons 
about 88000 of the newcomers this year have been soviets the 
government says 
immigration from the soviet union in august was a record 17484 
said yehuda weinraub a spokesman for the jewish agency he said 
1340 arrived from other countries 
to many in israel the importance of the immigrant wave is in 
building the jewish population in the arabdominated middle east 
jews already constitute a substantial majority in israel 
numbering more than 37 million compared with 850000 arabs 
but the arab birthrate remains nearly twice that of the jewish 
rate and there are 17 million arabs in the west bank and gaza 
strip which israel controls through a military government 
with the exception of egypt israel remains the enemy of the 
arab states that surround it 
housing minister ariel sharon in moscow to encourage more 
immigration said there was strength in numbers 
peace depends on the number of jews who come to israel he 
said 
in addition to contributing to security the arriving soviets 
could greatly increase israels pool of talent the government 
estimates that nearly onequarter of the new arrivals are doctors 
engineers scientists teachers and other professionals 
still absorbing the immigrants carries a high price tag and 
israel is increasingly looking for help abroad 
the jewish state has budgeted 23 billion over the next three 
years for immigrant absorption and recently approved a new housing 
construction program that will cost 400 million this year alone 
help from abroad includes more than 740 million funneled this 
year through the jewish agency a quasigovernmental organization 
that assists in resettlement 
the international israel bond campaign has pledged to raise a 
record 1 billion this year for the immigrants 
israel also is seeking 400 million in loan guarantees from the 
united states to build new housing the guarantees have been held 
up by us demands that israel ensure none of the funds goes to 
settling the newcomers in the occupied territories

local government officials complaining that 
preliminary 1990 census figures are too low will soon see the 
numbers rise the director of the us census bureau said tuesday 
the census count will increase in practically every 
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage 
improvement programs said barbara everitt bryant we expect to 
add millions of persons before the count is delivered to the 
president 
the deadline for getting the count to president bush is dec 31 
according to federal law 
the census bureau is now in its postenumeration survey 
stage to recheck the preliminary us population figure of 
245837681 
bryant described to a house subcommittee the methods the bureau 
is using to recheck the figures they include 
recounts in areas where the preliminary numbers have been 
challenged by local governments 
addition of probationers and parolees not counted at their home 
addresses 
addition of people at the address they report as their usual 
residence if at first count they were somewhere else 
recanvassing based on information obtained by the bureau 
through calls to its 800numbers construction permits media 
reports and other sources 
addition of people answering were you counted forms 
reinterviews 
addition of overseas military and civilian federal employees 
and their dependents 
bryant said that over 39000 cities counties and other local 
governments received preliminary housing unit counts in august 
each has three weeks to challenge the figures a challenge could 
lead to a recount 
by oct 15 all late census interviews must be completed after 
analyzing the data the secretary of commerce will decide by next 
july 15 whether to adjust the census for undercounts or 
overcounts bryant said 
rep thomas sawyer dohio chairman of the house post office 
and civil service subcommittee on census and population said 
accuracy has never been more important than in 1990 when 
operational problems have raised many questions about the 
thoroughness of the count 
several members appearing before the subcommittee said their 
districts were miscounted some questioned the categories into 
which people were placed as inevitably resulting in the united 
states appearing more white than it actually is 
rep norman mineta dcalif said asian and pacific islanders 
were being categorized as caucasians 
to group the asianpacific islanders with the group most 
likely to be overcounted is a disservice said mineta 
rep robert matsui dcalif called it continued 
insensitivity toward asianamericans as a minority group 
rep martin frost dtexas criticized preliminary figures for 
his state that showed the predominantly white suburban counties 
had more population in 1990 than in the census bureaus 1988 
projection while the heavily hispanic counties showed less 
are we to believe that the census bureau consistently found 
more whites than they estimated but was unable to find even the 
number of hispanics that they had estimated in 1988 he said 
rep charles schumer dny saying almost everything that 
could have gone wrong with the census in new york did 
criticized the postcount review for not addressing inhousehold 
misses those people who werent counted as part of a household in 
which all the other members were counted

president bush and secretary of state james a 
baker iii have revived talk of a mideast peace conference but a 
senior us official said tuesday the idea is premature 
this is not the time said the official who is here with 
baker for talks with president mikhail s gorbachev and other 
soviet officials on a variety of issues 
first the official said the basis of negotiations between 
israel and palestinian arabs would have to be worked out and he 
said even if there is a conference the negotiations would be 
carried out between the two sides 
the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity tried to 
soften the impact of the statements by bush and baker at last 
weekends helsinki summit meeting the soviet union 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who the americans want to 
induce to negotiate withdrawal from the west bank and gaza is 
opposed to an international peace conference he is concerned that 
the soviets and the arabs would use such a gathering to collaborate 
on terms unfavorable to israel 
we will not participate in such an international conference 
shamir said last week after soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze raised the idea 
but bush and baker eager for soviet cooperation against iraq 
said subsequently that a conference on the middle east would be 
appropriate under certain conditions 
the official concurred at the appropriate time wed be in 
favor of it he said it can be helpful 
but he stressed the united states would be the judge of when 
conditions were right 
first he said the basis for negotiations would have to be 
substantially developed and he said the conference would 
have to be properly structured moving toward negotiations in a 
bilateral way 
the idea that the united states would judge the timing and that 
the negotiations would remain in the hands of israel and its arab 
neighbors is bound to please jerusalem 
shamir has said he is willing to negotiate with palestinians 
from the west bank and gaza after leaders are chosen in an election 
and after a trial period of limited selfrule 
gorbachev however on sunday described the arabisraeli dispute 
as being of even more concern than iraqs invasion of kuwait

united press international is closing bureaus 
in six states as part of a general restructuring of the news 
service a upi spokesman said tuesday 
spokesman milt capps confirmed that oneperson bureaus in grand 
rapids mich bismarck nd syracuse ny and santa fe nm 
were being closed as were offices in montana and wyoming 
capps denied however what he said was the erroneous 
impression that we are doing anything but increasing our coverage 
in these states 
he said upi would rely more on stringer networks and its joint 
venture partners which include tvs financial news network states 
news service and financial world magazine 
asked if other bureaus had been closed capps said i have no 
further announcements he declined to give details on future 
closures or how many bureaus upi now operates in the united states 
but said a change up and down in staffing will be continuing for 
several months 
last month he confirmed a washington post report that 31 upi 
reporters and editors were being laid off 
he said upi was realigning staff throughout the organization 
this summer and fall with a shift toward specific fields such as 
business and finance and sports 
the upshot is that virtually every bureau in the system 
worldwide is affected either by increases or decreases 
we are developing what we think is a new role for upi after 83 
years which entails not only strong general news service but 
increased emphasis on focused news reports that can command a 
premium in the market place including media and corporate 
subscribers he said 
the bottom line is we can now say we have more people writing 
for upi across the board than a year ago he said

nelson mandela accused the 
government tuesday of waging war against his african national 
congress and said failure to halt black factional fighting 
threatened talks on ending apartheid 
mandela held an urgent meeting with president fw de klerk as 
vicious black factional fighting left at least 24 people dead 
police said unrest in black townships around johannesburg continued 
into the night with shacks burned in tokoza and running clashes 
between black factions in katlehong 
we will do everything in our power to ensure that the peace 
process remains on track but the government has to do its part 
mandela said in pretoria after tuesdays meeting if it is 
dragging its feet as it is doing now then the peace process is 
definitely threatened 
de klerk said in a brief statement the growing sense of urgency 
in the country demanded that leaders get the chance to complete 
talks on a new constitution he offered no new steps on ending the 
violence 
about 700 blacks have died since clashes pitting xhosa and other 
blacks linked to the anc against zulus loyal to the conservative 
inkatha movement erupted a month ago in johannesburgarea townships 
the fighting spread from eastern natal province where the 
ethnic and political warfare has killed more than 5000 blacks in 
five years mandela said the government had failed to take 
visible measures to halt the fighting such as sending in its 
powerful military 
the government sent military units to the black townships almost 
two weeks after the violence erupted aug 12 the fighting raged on 
the government cannot be allowed to talk peace and negotiation 
while it conducts war against the anc mandela said 
an anc statement issued later noted that the government had 
established the kwazulu homeland in natal and it alleged that 
kwazulu leaders were using the power they received from the 
government to carry out warfare against political opponents 
mandela has previously warned the violence threatened 
negotiations on ending apartheid and political power for blacks 
but the talks with the government have continued 
mandela also has appealed for his supporters to lay down their 
arms the continued violence indicates he lacks control over the 
townships 
if the government fails to take action and if the violence 
continues to rise and if the people continue to demand to be 
armed we will find it difficult to oppose that demand he said 
tuesday 
the anc lacks a significant arsenal however it suspended its 
mostly ineffective armed struggle against the government this year 
as a prelude to peace talks 
most of the street fighting has involved crude weapons such as 
axes machetes clubs spears and gardening tools 
de klerks statement said ending the violence depended on a 
political solution as well as possible steps by the government it 
said recommendations from mandelas delegation would be considered 
police said 20 people were killed early tuesday in katlehong 
while one person died in tokoza and three were killed in vosloorus 
at least one black man was hacked to death tuesday and several 
injured on a train in johannesburg by men with machetes who 
rampaged through carriages attacking passengers police said 
mandela and the anc the countrys largest black opposition 
group have repeatedly charged that police have instigated violence 
or aided inkatha fighters police and government officials have 
rejected the charges 
random attacks on blacks in the past week have also led to 
allegations that rightwing whites are involved in a secret 
campaign to instigate violence 
the government has said it was investigating reports that whites 
with blackened faces took part in some attacks 
the anc and inkatha blame each other for the fighting but the 
anc has refused to meet with inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi 
both groups oppose apartheid but differ on the shape of a future 
south africa 
the anc claims buthelezi spread the violence from natal to the 
johannesburg area to broaden his constituency inkatha accuses the 
anc of launching a terror campaign to monopolize power among black 
opposition groups

stanislav s shatalin who drew up the economic 
plan approved by the russian parliament tuesday supports private 
ownership of property a multiparty system and cuts in military 
spending 
although a member of the communist party since 1963 the frail 
economist who looks older than his 56 years says he is inclined 
toward the partys social democratic wing he says he even 
considers president mikhail s gorbachev head of the soviet 
communist party to be a social democrat at heart 
shatalin was appointed in march to gorbachevs advisory group 
the presidential council with the responsibility of formulating 
socioeconomic policy 
when asked in april by an interviewer for the radical weekly 
moscow news whether he and gorbachev were likeminded shatalin 
said they were in the sense that both were willing to listen to 
people who dont hold our views 
an academic secretary with the economics department of the 
soviet academy of sciences since 1989 shatalin has been studying 
economic science for more than 30 years 
for me socialism first means real pluralism in the economy 
including private ownership in its modern form primarily stocks 
he said in the interview second it is progressive profit taxes 
third its social protection including unemployment benefits 
retraining benefits etc these mechanisms work well in many 
civilized countries 
fourth it is social justice he said not the demagoguery 
about social justice that was practiced in this country for 
decades but social justice based on an efficient economy 
while not a close confidante of gorbachev he said he likes the 
soviet leaders honesty benevolence and quickness of mind 
free from dogmatism perhaps he too discerned in me some 
qualities that we have in common 
i regard myself as a russian intellectual shatalin told 
moscow news russian intellectuals used to take to heart and do 
take to heart the misfortunes and hopes of the russian people and 
all soviet citizens

the jackpot for the next florida lotto 
drawing was set at 90 million tuesday and fast ticket sales meant 
prospects were improving for a 100 million prize lottery 
officials said 
if we have an incredible day today its possible said 
lottery secretary rebecca paul i probably need another 24 hours 
to know for sure 
mrs paul said 75 percent of a weeks lotto tickets are usually 
sold thursday friday and saturday when the drawing is held the 
90 million figure is a projection that includes estimates for 
those three days 
sales through 11 am tuesday are about 100 percent higher 
than the best week on record she said 
but she didnt think florida would be able to top pennsylvanias 
record 115 million jackpot shared by several winners on april 26 
1989 
i dont think theres enough time for the jackpot to go that 
high mrs paul said 
with no winner in the last three weekend drawings the lotto has 
reached its highest total since the game began in florida in 1988 
its created a great deal of interest she said 
lotto jackpots roll over when no one picks all the winning 
numbers the lottery department then estimates the size of the next 
weeks jackpot based on the rollover and sales projections 
on saturday there were no winning tickets in a 50 million 
lottery the next day the jackpot was set at 75 million on 
monday it was raised to 80 million 
floridas best previous week in lottery sales was in april when 
a 583 million jackpot was shared by several winners 
the world record of the largest single lottery prize still goes 
to sheelah ryan of winter springs who won a florida lotto jackpot 
of 551 million two years ago 
players select six numbers from one to 49 and must hit on all 
six to collect the grand prize which would be paid out over 20 
years multiple winners would share equally in the jackpot 
the odds of someone picking the winning numbers are about one in 
14 million

the national institutes of health on tuesday 
approved the human genetherapy trials experiments that scientists 
say will begin a new chapter in medicine 
approval was given to use gene therapy to treat a rare immune 
disorder in children and a lethal form of skin cancer 
the agencys green light which was expected follows the nih 
recombinant dna advisory committees july 31 recommendation that 
the tests be approved 
the experiments still must be approved by the food and drug 
administration before they can begin 
in the trials patients would be treated with cells that had 
been altered by the addition of new genes 
genes which direct the actions of cells will cause the treated 
cells to produce special proteins that will either amplify a 
biological action or replace proteins that were missing 
in the protocol for treatment of severe combined immune 
deficiency disease a human gene that instructs a cell to make 
adenosine deaminase or ada would be inserted into the patients 
white blood cells the disease is caused by a deficiency of ada 
the other experiments would involve patients with melanoma a 
gene for the cancerkilling tumor necrosis factor would be inserted 
into a patients tumor infiltrating lymphocytes which are 
cancerkilling white cells

more than 250000 seriously mentally ill 
americans have been left untreated and are living miserable 
sometimes violent lives on the streets and in shelters and jails 
according to a report tuesday by two advocacy groups 
in all one researcher said about half of the estimated 2 
million people who have a serious mental illness are not receiving 
treatment 
the report lays much of the blame on psychiatrists and 
psychologists many of whom the groups say were trained with public 
funds but have abandoned the public system for more lucrative 
private practice 
the advocacy groups public citizen and the national alliance 
for the mentally ill also fault the priorities of many public 
programs that they said spend too much of their resources providing 
such services as stress management instead of treating people with 
severe mental illnesses 
care for the seriously mentally ill is a national disaster 
said laurie flynn executive director of the alliance 
dr sidney wolfe who heads the health research group of public 
citizen founded by consumer advocate ralph nader said some 
communities have built great model programs therefore he 
said it becomes more and more intolerable when others dont 
adopt them 
the american psychiatric association objected strongly to the 
reports snide scapegoating statements about psychiatrists 
saying they have had a historic commitment to providing 
services for the severely mentally ill who rely on the public 
system twenty percent of psychiatrists work in the public sector 
which the apa said is a higher percentage than in any other area of 
medicine 
apa spokesman john blamphin said psychiatrists would not be 
opposed to donating an hour of their time a week to public 
programs as the report recommends if thats also required of 
others working in the health field 
the report care of the seriously mentally ill a rating of 
state programs evaluates the services provided by each state and 
scores them accordingly the groups began this biennial review in 
1986 
the report assesses hospital services outpatient and community 
support services vocational rehabilitation housing services and 
programs for seriously emotionally disturbed children 
vermont ranked highest scoring 17 of a possible 25 points new 
hampshire and rhode island each scored 16 connecticut and ohio 15 
each and colorado 14 
hawaii finished last as it did in the 1986 and 1988 reports 
with 2 points idaho and wyoming each scored 3 mississippi and 
montana 4 each and nevada and texas 5 each 
overall the new england states tended to score among the 
highest while more western states were at the bottom of the list 
we think that there is kind of a culture of caring that has 
grown up in some states and not in others clearly this is 
strongest in new england and weakest in the west said dr e 
fuller torrey a psychiatrist with public citizens health research 
group 
in the west with texas as a good example its kind of a 
macho mentality youre supposed to take care of yourself he 
said 
all told he said as many as one million seriously mentally ill 
people nationwide are not actively receiving treatment 
the report said one of the major reasons the public system is so 
lacking is that mental health professionals many of whom were 
trained with the help of government funds dont want to treat the 
seriously mentally ill 
rather the report said most psychologists and psychiatrists 
spend their time in their offices counseling people with 
relatively minor mental health problems torrey said 
since the federal government began subsidizing training of 
mental health professionals in 1945 the number of psychiatrists 
has grown from 3000 to 40000 the report said the number of 
psychologists has risen from 4200 to 70000 and psychiatric social 
workers from 2000 to about 80000 
to illustrate his point torrey said that while princeton nj 
has one psychiatrist for every 250 people jersey city nj has 
one for every 13600 people 
the professionals who have been trained with public funds have 
gone off to private practice and left the seriously mentally ill in 
the public sector without any care he said 
the gap is being filled by foreign medical students who now 
constitute about twothirds of the psychiatrists in public 
psychiatric hospitals and clinics in the united states the report 
said

the us forest service staff has drawn up 
suggestions for relaxing environmental protection to boost 
production of oil and gas from national forests officials said 
tuesday 
the fourpage proposed strategy for mitigating persian gulf 
situation cites estimates of almost 7 billion barrels of 
undiscovered recoverable oil on forest service lands but says 
environmental regulations are slowing or blocking exploratory 
drilling to find the oil 
it cites the loss of about 45 million barrels of oil per day 
from iraq and kuwait because of a worldwide embargo 
we have been considering some things the forest service can 
do said tom king the services geology program manager we at 
no time intended to imply that were going to go out and commit 
environmental rape and ruin were not in that business 
he referred to the proposal as an idea document which has 
not been approved by senior agency officials king said he was 
designated to respond to queries about the proposals tuesday in the 
absence of the services director of minerals and geology 
the forest service proposals were reported in tuesdays 
washington post 
david alberswerth public lands director of the national 
wildlife federation told the post he considered the document one 
of many similar illconceived initiatives that we will see form the 
oil industry and its allies in government 
the forest service controls 191 million acres of public lands 
of which about 14 million acres are leased to oil and gas 
producers down from 35 million acres in 1983 
the staff proposal said 40 environmental impact statements on 
drilling leases in the national forests were scheduled for 
completion between 1992 and 1995 
given the persian gulf situation consideration should be 
given to expediting the schedule it said adding that perhaps 
some of the impact statements could be replaced by more expeditious 
environmental assessments 
the paper said requests to drill should be dealt with as quickly 
as possible 
we need to act on these wells if in our professional opinion 
the impacts to the environment are within acceptable limits it 
said if lawsuits are filed perhaps the courts will be lenient 
given the national interest that is at stake 
other proposals in the document do not call for relaxed 
environmental standards but for mobilizing forest service 
personnel to deal with existing regulations more quickly 
in the event that a forest cannot ensure an immediate response 
to a request to drill specialized teams should be assembled from 
other forests it said drilling should be given the same 
urgency and management attention as fire 
the proposals also suggest that congress might act to streamline 
current environmental regulations since there is a perception 
that federal lands possess good drilling prospects in areas that 
have been overly protected

the united states and the soviet union eager to 
conclude a conventional forces treaty by years end may drop 
provisions limiting troops in europe a senior us official said 
tuesday 
such a move would leave only one stumbling block to finishing 
the accord a prospective ban on nonnuclear aircraft the 
official said that provision may be dropped as well 
we have the clock ticking he said were getting to the 
point where we are going to have to wrap this up 
a 35nation summit conference to sign the treaty is being 
planned in paris in midnovember the pact is being negotiated in 
vienna between nato and the warsaw pact 
the official spoke to reporters here with secretary of state 
james a baker iii one day before the victorious world war ii 
allies take a historic step to reunite the germany they defeated 45 
years ago 
a dispute over missile launchers in what is now east germany 
which threatened to delay eventual german sovereignty was resolved 
on the eve of the ceremony west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher said without providing details 
the conventional forces treaty would set limits on tanks 
artillery and other nonnuclear weapons and on nonnuclear 
aircraft unless they are dropped from the treaty 
aircraft and manpower have been very difficult said the 
official who requested anonymity so we are considering removing 
limits on aircraft as well 
the soviets have argued that some of their planes the united 
states wants scrapped have defensive missions and should not be 
limited 
the soviet union already is withdrawing thousands of troops from 
eastern europe and has agreed to remove the 350000 men based in 
east germany within four years of german unification due oct 3 
the united states agreed in february to limit us forces in 
europe to 225000 with a ceiling of 195000 on soviet troops 
but the soviet pullout from east germany will leave moscow with 
far fewer troops consequently soviets negotiators want to lower 
the us ceiling 
baker discussed the issue briefly with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze and british foreign secretary douglas hurd 
representing the british at wednesdays ceremonies in separate 
sessions here 
under secretary of state reginald bartholomew has been 
conducting negotiations on the troop question with the soviets here 
since monday 
if omitted from the treaty troop reductions would be governed 
by events in europe and by budget decisions in washington and 
moscow the official said 
as for the issue of eventual german sovereignty genscher told 
reporters that there was still disagreement over the kind of 
military maneuvers that could be held in what is now east germany 
at issue in the missile question is whether launchers capable of 
packing nucleartipped missiles could be deployed in east germany 
earlier tuesday a us official said the matter was a tough 
question of definition 
a way he said must be found to delineate the kind of missile 
that would not carry nuclear weapons and therefore would be 
acceptable in moscow for basing in the area the launchers would be 
under nato control but could be operated by germans who have 
forsworn having nuclear weapons of their own 
baker hurd genscher shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of 
france and east germany will sign on wednesday an accord known as 
the twoplusfour agreement on the reunification of germany 
while reunification is set for oct 3 final german sovereignty 
requires the four world war ii victors to relinquish their joint 
postwar powers including control and access to berlin which once 
again will be the german capital 
this week the soviets and west germans compromised on the money 
bonn would pay for the withdrawal of the troops the soviets had 
demanded about 12 billion while bonn offered nearly 45 billion 
on monday soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
announced the compromise which west german television placed at 
about 77 billion moscow has said that the returning soviet 
troops will need housing and job training a considerable burden 
for the ailing soviet economy

the failure of a natural gas pipeline company 
to make sure a 16inch pipeline was securely buried beneath the 
gulf of mexico caused a fiery accident last year that killed 11 
crew members of a fishing boat the national traffic safety board 
said tuesday 
the safety board also said that the failure of the office of 
pipeline safety to require pipeline operators to inspect and 
maintain submerged pipelines contributed to the accident in shallow 
waters a halfmile off sabine texas 
but it said the pipeline safety office needs more personnel and 
resources to accomplish its mission 
the board said that while the fishing boat the northumberland 
was either very close to or penetrating the sea bottom at the time 
of the accident on oct 3 1989 the ship was not responsible 
because it was operating in its normal area and at a reasonable 
speed 
the accident the board said would not have occurred had 
the natural gas pipeline co of america maintained the pipeline 
at the depth required by the permit issued by the us army corps 
of engineers 
a spokesman for the company which has headquarters in lombard 
ill said there would be no comment until officials had a chance 
to review the safety boards conclusions 
in more than 20 recommendations the safety board an arm of the 
department of transportation urged a program be put into operation 
to inspect the companys submerged pipelines and to maintain them 
in accordance with permits requiring them to be safely buried 
the board has no enforcement powers but can only make 
recommendations to governmental agencies and private companies for 
safety improvements 
the board urged safety programs be established to warn vessels 
of the dangers of submerged pipelines and said navigation charts 
should be revised to warn mariners that submerged pipelines may not 
be safely buried 
in discussing the accident safety board members said there are 
more than 18000 miles of submerged pipelines in the gulf of mexico 
alone but that the exact length of the system or the precise 
location of all of its components is not known 
there are no records to verify how many miles of pipeline are 
out in the gulf said board member susan m coughlin 
she questioned whether actual inspection of the pipeline system 
should begin before promised technology is developed to do the job 
without the costly and time consuming use of divers 
but other members said the board has an obligation to the safety 
of seafarers to urge that work begin now to see that submerged 
pipelines are in fact safely buried 
the safety board said that inspection by divers after the 
accident showed that while the pipeline should have been buried 
some nine feet below the sea bed it was in fact lying on its 
surface 
when the northumberland hit and ruptured it the safety board 
said natural gas from the high pressure pipeline was released 
and ignited engulfing the vessel in flames within seconds

distracted

achievements such as minnesotas improved economy and the june 
visit of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev dubbed governor 
goofy in a jan 22 newsweek magazine article the governor 
referred to the moniker in one television ad while saying his

perpichs antiabortion stand and said providing affordable health 
care to all minnesotans was a top goal

a new public relations department in the kgb is 
using a film titled the secret war to wage a very open campaign 
of its own to improve the security agencys tarnished image 
we are having troubles because the soviet public doesnt 
understand what we do said the head of the new section maj 
gen alexander karbainov 
since the advent of mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
the soviet press has been filled with accounts of terror by the 
secret police in the early decades of communist rule 
millions died and millions more were sent to labor camps 
particularly under josef stalin whose bloody rule lasted from the 
1920s until his death in 1953 
stalin turned the cheka secret police into a virtual organ 
of personal power karbainov told a news conference for soviet 
and foreign reporters in the lubyanka the drab downtown 
headquarters of the security service 
the soviet foreign and domestic intelligence operations are 
combined in one service the kgb unlike the united states where 
the functions are divided between the central intelligence agency 
and the federal bureau of investigation 
during the news conference karbainov disclosed little new about 
the internal workings of the kgb arguing it was necessary to 
preserve secrecy about operations budget and the number of 
employees 
everything relating to the aims directions and results of kgb 
work should be open to the public while methods forms and 
techniques used to perform specific operations and security agents 
should remain hidden from public view for the timebeing he said 
karbainov a 44yearold former satellite communications 
engineer sketched out an ambitious public relations program he is 
running from a labyrinth of rooms that includes the offices of 
felix dzerzhinsky founder of the soviet secret police and yuri 
andropov the former kgb chairman who headed the country in 1982 
the kgb is releasing a longdelayed film the secret war on 
its battles with western intelligence agencies as well as 
television specials on its efforts to fight terrorism ethnic 
violence and blackmarketeering 
kgb officers showed reporters an exhibition of photographs and 
newspaper clippings of various western intelligence operations 
against the soviet union all had been reported in the soviet press 
karbainov said the kgb also is starting a promotional 
periodical and will issue accreditation to a limited number of 
journalists to enter the lubyanka to view the exhibitions and sip 
coffee in a newly created press bar 
were trying to fight the stereotypes of old he said

nasa expects to be ready for another 
attempt to launch columbia on tuesday at the earliest and will have 
only a few days to get the shuttle off the ground officials said 
tuesday 
if columbia fails to lift off next week the mission will have 
to wait until after discovery is launched next month said bascom 
murrah a nasa official in charge of columbias prelaunch 
operations 
were doing the best we can murrah said its a tough 
business 
columbias astronomy mission with a 150 million observatory 
called astro has been delayed twice by hydrogen leaks and once by 
problems with a telescope aboard the shuttle the latest scrub 
occurred last week after hydrogen flooded the aft compartment 
nasa installed a new set of recirculation pumps monday and 
planned to test them late tuesday and early wednesday by flushing 
helium through the system 
in the pumps that were removed earlier helium tests failed to 
find any leaks said nasa spokesman george diller officials 
planned to try again with supercold liquid hydrogen to simulate 
actual fueling conditions 
murrah said columbia will be ready for launch no sooner than 
tuesday nasa hoped to announce a launch date on wednesday 
complicating matters for the national aeronautics and space 
administration is the air forces plans to launch a titan 4 rocket 
with a secret military cargo early next week from nearby cape 
canaveral air force station one to two days are needed between 
launches because of range safety requirements 
also looming over nasas flight plans is the need to launch 
discovery between oct 5 and oct 23 with a satellite that will 
explore the suns polar regions 
if nasa misses that deadline discoverys 750 million mission 
will have to be postponed until late 1991 when earth is aligned 
properly again with the sun and jupiter 
the satellite called ulysses will use jupiters gravity to be 
whipped into the proper orbit around the sun it will be the first 
spacecraft to circle over the suns poles 
preparations for discoverys flight have been running several 
days behind because of a leak in the shuttles cooling system but 
launch managers are juggling the work schedule to make up for the 
lost time 
the problem has been traced to a vent in an ammonia boiler and 
mission managers have recommended that discovery fly with the leaky 
boiler as long as the leak remains small given the amount of 
leakage about 1 percent a day there would be more than enough 
coolant to last the fourday flight diller said the boiler is 
needed to cool the shuttle during landings

an alabama professor urged a senate committee 
tuesday to reject president bushs nominee to a federal appeals 
court because of his wifes current and his own previous membership 
in an allwhite country club 
george munchus iii associate professor of business at the 
university of alabama at birmingham said confirmation of us 
district judge joel dubina to a seat on the 11th us circuit court 
of appeals would have a double chilling effect on civil rights 
litigation in georgia alabama and florida 
munchus who is executive director of the center for human 
rights in birmingham argued in testimony before the judiciary 
committee that dubinas resignation from the montgomery country 
club and his wifes subsequent membership is subterfuge of the 
highest order and most reprehensible 
if nonwhites and women are expected to have full faith and 
confidence in our federal judicial system this country can ill 
afford the joel dubina types to serve munchus said 
the committee last month unanimously approved a nonbinding 
resolution which said that belonging to exclusionary clubs is 
inappropriate for persons who may be nominated in the future to 
serve in the federal judiciary 
dubina testified that his wife joined the club in 1986 shortly 
after he had resigned his membership prior to his nomination as a 
us district court judge 
but dubina said he has not visited the club nor enjoyed any club 
privileges since resigning and he said his wife has promised to 
resign if the club ever rejects a qualified black applicant 
during questioning by sen howell heflin dala prior to 
munchus testimony dubina said the club does not bar members on 
the basis of race or religion but he acknowledged that it has no 
black members he said no black has ever applied for membership 
after he resigned dubina said his wife was offered a lady 
resident membership and she accepted he said her grandfather was 
a member her father is a member and she grew up in that club

communist vietnam and prowestern asian 
nations on tuesday welcomed an agreement among cambodias warring 
factions but cautioned of further obstacles before peace comes to 
that wartorn nation 
the official vietnam news agency quoted a foreign ministry 
statement as saying the agreement monday in jakarta indonesia 
is a decisive step leading to the reconvening of the paris 
international conference on cambodia the peace process however 
still has to overcome numerous obstacles and hurdles 
together with other countries participating in the paris 
international conference on cambodia vietnam will do its best to 
contribute to the success of the conference in achieving an overall 
political solution to the cambodia issue it said 
in paris in july and august of 1989 19 nations failed to 
produce a peace accord and concluded there must be substantial 
progress among the cambodian factions themselves before the 
conference could be reconvened 
vietnam has been the main backer of the phnom penh government 
most southeast asian nations have supported the threeparty 
guerrilla coalition but also have stepped up mediation efforts in 
recent years to end the 11yearold civil war 
a thai government spokesman announced that premier hun sen of 
cambodias vietnameseinstalled government will visit thailand on 
wednesday to discuss the next step of the peace process with prime 
minister chatichai choonhavan a key mediator 
the cambodian government and the three guerrilla groups battling 
it agreed in indonesia to accept as a basis for a settlement a un 
security council plan the plan calls for a major un role in 
administering the country until elections are held 
the factions also agreed to form a supreme national council to 
represent the country and be the source of authority during the 
transitional period 
hun sen also called in jakarta for an immediate ceasefire the 
official cambodian news agency spk reported it did not say how the 
guerrillas responded but they have previously supported a truce 
only in the context of a comprehensive political settlement 
the security council plan envisions a un peacekeeping force of 
as many as 10000 soldiers and 10000 civilian workers 
the operation could cost the united nations up to 5 billion 
over one or two years according to us officials 
staterun radio thailand reported tuesday that chatichai 
welcomed the jakarta agreement and said his country may be willing 
to join the un peacekeeping force 
thailand gives aid and sanctuary to the guerrillas but also has 
been a prime mediator since chatichai took office in august 1988 
australian prime minister bob hawke also reiterated his country 
would be willing to contribute troops to the un operation he was 
addressing the parliament in canberra 
foreign minister wong kan seng of singapore a major source of 
arms for the guerrillas welcomed the jakarta agreement and said it 
should be followed by reopening the paris conference 
the japanese government which hosted cambodian peace talks in 
june where the first consensus on the supreme national council was 
reached also welcomed the outcome at jakarta 
in the june talks final agreement could not be reached because 
of objections from the hardline khmer rouge guerrilla group which 
said it was not being treated on an equal status with the 
government 
of course there still remain several problems such as how 
actual suspension of military actions is to be realized how the 
united nations will be involved in the administration of that 
country in the interim period and other problems japanese 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said 
the guerrilla coalition consists of the communist khmer rouge 
and two noncommunist forces led by former premier son sann and 
prince norodom sihanouk 
the resistance coalition has been battling the government 
vietnam installed in phnom penh after it invaded in late 1978 and 
toppled the khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge had during nearly four years of rule tried to 
transform cambodia into a radical agrarian society causing the 
deaths of nearly 1 million people due mostly to starvation and 
executions

astronaut bruce mccandless ii who will be 
remembered in history books as the first human to float free in 
space has retired from nasa and the navy 
while his name is not well known his picture is the photograph 
of mccandless suspended against the black of space with the blue 
earth off to one side is one of the most famous 
ive been government property since the age of 17 said 
mccandless 53 in an interview from the johnson space center 
ive been here for 24 years in the astronaut office it was time 
for a little bit of a change of pace 
mccandless a navy captain remained in the service while 
serving with nasa he had to retire under navy regulations because 
he was not promoted to flag rank and had 32 years of service 
mccandless graduated from the naval academy ranking second in a 
class of 899 
he said he hopes to work as a consultant with contractors 
involved in the hubble space telescope project mccandless had a 
key role as an astronaut in developing the telescope and he was 
part of the space shuttle crew that launched it in april 
mccandless helped develop the space agencys manned maneuvering 
unit a jetpowered backpack and was the first to wear it in space 
on a flight in february 1984 
he was the first human to move in space untethered looking like 
a helpless teddy bear swaddled in white 
that may have been one small step for neil but its a heck of 
a big leap for me said mccandless as he floated out of the cargo 
of space shuttle challenger he was parodying neil armstrongs 
first words when he stepped on the moon on july 20 1969

officials of states that claim they 
are becoming the nations toxic waste dumps criticized the federal 
government tuesday for not penalizing states that fail to take care 
of their own hazardous poisons 
environmental officials from 13 of the 17 states that receive 
more toxic waste for disposal than they ship out opened a twoday 
conference to form an association that could file lawsuits against 
the us environmental protection agency 
top epa officials appeared before the state representatives who 
demanded that the epa get tough on violators of a 1986 federal 
program aimed at making states deal with hazardous waste 
the capacity assurance program required all states to come 
up with a toxic waste disposal plan epa officials said all 50 
states and the district of columbia met last octobers deadline for 
submitting proposed plans but only 38 were approved by the federal 
agency 
alabama and south carolina with major hazardous waste landfills 
inside their borders organized the association of net importer 
states to work collectively to make exporter states share the 
disposal problem 
if you dont do something pretty quickly you will force the 
states to do something we dont want to do bill child 
representing the illinois state epa told russ wyer director of 
the waste management division at epa headquarters in washington 
leigh pegues director of the alabama department of 
environmental management said a lawsuit against epa was not out of 
the question he said epa administrator bill riley and his deputy 
hank habicht turned down invitations to attend the alabama meeting 
wyer promised to return to washington with the states 
complaints but did not promise epa would take stronger measures 
against noncomplying states however he said the agency would 
evaluate sanctions that could be imposed for failure to meet 
the deadline in the capacity assurance program 
the net importer states claim epa has failed to withhold 
superfund cleanup money from states that have failed to meet the 
programs requirements 
they havent done anything said pegues whose state is home 
to the nations largest commercial hazardous waste landfill a 
toxic dump run by chemical waste management inc at emelle in rural 
west alabama 
epa officials blamed regional differences throughout the country 
and the problems some states have with the staffing of their 
environmental agencies which are assigned the job of complying 
with the federal program 
at a luncheon tuesday alabama gov guy hunt said alabama and 
the 16 other importer states continue to manage more than our 
share of the problem 
asked about the possibility of a lawsuit against epa ng kaul 
representing the new york department of environmental conservation 
said that would be a last resort 
but he said the epa has yet to act against new jersey which 
according to kaul has been looking for a landfill site almost 10 
years 
greer tidwell director of the atlanta regional office of the 
federal epa promised the state officials he would try to arrange a 
meeting next month with top epa officials in washington to discuss 
the state officials complaints about the agency 
delegates to the coastal conference represent california 
illinois indiana louisiana michigan nevada new york ohio 
oklahoma texas utah south carolina and alabama according to 
catherine lamar a spokeswoman for the alabama department of

defense secretary dick cheney disclosed 
tuesday that the cost of the us military buildup in the middle 
east could total 15 billion in the next fiscal year but promised 
disgruntled lawmakers a significant increase in help from arab 
nations and other american allies 
cheney and gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff testified before the senate armed services committee 
giving congress its first major update on the massive american 
military deployment that was begun in early august 
cheneys cost figure was above the 1 billionamonth estimate 
generally used by government officials and he added that costs 
would multiply many fold if us troops become involved in 
combat 
several senators used tuesdays session to show their distress 
over the amounts of military backing supplied by arab nations in 
the region and financial support from us allies heavily 
dependent upon persian gulf oil supplies 
theres something missing here protested the committee 
chairman sen sam nunn dga complaining that no arab military 
forces with heavy armaments such as tanks or artillery were on the 
ground in saudi arabia 
sen william cohen rmaine criticized both the west german 
government and the japanese for offering little support to an 
operation that was vital to keeping oil supplies flowing to their 
economies 
i find it appalling cohen told cheney and the general 
this kind of cooperation from the allies is not going to 
stand well with me and i hope with a lot of other members when it 
comes time to consider the amount of us funding that will go to 
us military forces helping provide for the defense of western 
europe and the far east 
in his testimony cheney told the senators that by sept 30 the 
end of the 1990 fiscal year we will have spent more than 27 
billion in additional costs over and above budgeted funds on the 
new operation in the middle east 
we expect these incremental costs to total about 15 billion 
in fiscal year 1991 if the crisis continues for the entire fiscal 
year cheneys statement said if the conflict occurs these 
costs would multiply many fold 
such costs would wipe out any peace dividend derived from 
cuts in pentagon spending in reaction to easing of tensions in 
europe absent contributions by us allies to help pay the bill 
for operation desert shield 
three nations saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab 
emirates said this week they would contribute about 12 billion 
to the mideast effort against iraq including money for nations 
hurt by their support of the economic embargo 
cheney said he couldnt pledge that the total cost of the us 
operation would be offset but i think a sizeable amount will 
be 
meanwhile a pentagon spokesman said tuesday the united states 
had detected some increase in military activity inside iraq 
near its borders with turkey and syria but there is nothing to 
indicate imminent hostilities 
the spokesman pete williams said that while the forces 
posture remained defensive it could become offensive very 
quickly 
on another subject williams said the naval embargo operation 
had logged some 750 intercepts but he cautioned that those can 
involve the same ship being contacted more than once 
he said some 40 boardings have been conducted including 35 by 
us ships he would not disclose the names of the other nations 
involved 
also williams disclosed that permission has been granted for 
us troops to conduct livefire training exercises in saudi arabia 
the approval was granted monday for the live firing of artillery 
and guns up to 105 mm and approval was being sought for 120 mm 
weapons he said 
at the senate hearing cheney said the pentagon was taking 
measures to enhance the protection of us troops and civilians 
overseas and at home believing that terrorism is potentially a 
significant weapon in the iraqi arsenal 
the state department returned iraq to its list of states 
abetting and aiding terrorism on sept 4 cheney said 
during this period of heightened tension the terrorist threat 
to our forces in saudi arabia and to us personnel and interests 
worldwide is and will remain high cheneys testimony said 
cheney disclosed that us officials have received bomb 
threats death threats and verbal warnings from international 
terrorist organizations but he added that no specific credible 
threats have yet been identified 
on the subject of contributions by nations benefiting from us 
defense of saudi arabia cheney told the senators i can assure 
you that is a subject we are working on 
there are in fact forces from other arab nations en route or 
will shortly be en route a significant increase in the military 
capability of the allies forces that are being deployed cheney 
said 
however powell interjected that these other forces are still 
some time from being there 
cheney reminded that the egyptians and moroccans as well as 
eight nine ten other arab countries have pledged to increase 
their commitments to the region but nunn dismissed the 
contributions as very small in number and very light in 
terms of armament 
cheney also noted that few countries other than the united 
states have the logistical capability of moving heavy forces abroad

a lawyer for rodney dangerfield said tuesday 
comic who complains of getting no respect received none when he was 
allegedly injured in a steam room accident at caesars palace in 
march 1988 
but an attorney for the resort countered that dangerfield 
created his own problems saying the eye injuries he blamed on 
caesars were selfinflicted 
caesars lawyer louis meisinger told jurors in us district 
court in his opening statement they would know why dangerfield gets 
no respect once the civil trial ends 
dangerfield is suing caesars for 225000 in lost wages plus 
damages of 5 million in connection with the accident caesars is 
countersuing dangerfield for 100000 plus punitive damages 
dangerfield left caesars following the march 1988 incident he 
now performs across the strip at ballys hotel 
attorney barry langberg said dangerfield had performed nearly 
1000 shows in las vegas without a cancellation until his eyes were 
burned in the steam room accident march 16 1988 
he said caesars tried to escape blame for the accident and 
refused to pay dangerfield 225000 for five performances he missed 
after the accident 
meisinger described dangerfield as a petulant performer and 
said his injuries were a figment of his fertile comedic 
imagination he called on the jury to send a message to 
peformers like mr dangerfield that they are not special and cannot 
do things like that 
lawyers for both sides huddled for more than an hour before 
opening arguments began tuesday reviewing a series of motions one 
issue is whether to allow claims raised by caesars in court papers 
filed last month 
the resort claimed in the papers that dangerfield used large 
amounts of marijuana cocaine and vodka 
dangerfield denied the allegations monday anybody who knows 
me knows its untrue he said after jury selection 
the drug issue was not raised in opening arguments 
langberg said dangerfields eyes were injured by a burst of 
steam when he entered a steam room 
dangerfield missed shows march 17 18 and 19 when two shows 
were scheduled then performed shows march 20 and 21 while in pain 
langberg said 
caesars officials paid dangerfield for only three nights on 
march 22 he went on stage and announced to a packed house that he 
wouldnt be performing that night and suggested the audience get 
their money back meisinger said 
we think this is a simple case that the caesars that injured 
rodney dangerfield through its negligence should pay him 
langberg contended 
meisinger said dangerfield is attempting to blame caesars for an 
eye problem the comic has had since the 1970s he said 
dangerfields eye problems have been compounded by a medication he 
continues to use despite doctors warnings that it could severely 
damage his eyes he said dangerfield applied the medication to his 
eyes 10 times in one hour the day after the steam room incident 
mr dangerfield essentially applied poison to his own eyes 
meisinger said the injury was a selfinflicted act by mr 
dangerfield 
meisinger said dangerfield visited doctors in the days after the 
accident 
these doctors will testify they thought he could have 
performed but they thought he was not motivated to perform 
meisinger said this is a case of a performer who got very very 
mad when caesars said we expect you to live up to your contract

troops loyal to slain president samuel 
doe bombarded rebels from atop the executive mansion tuesday and a 
west african leader said does death would make it more difficult 
to end the war 
two days after rebels led by prince johnson attacked doe and his 
entourage at the headquarters of the west african task force the 
late presidents men used heavy cannons to beat back insurgents 
throughout monrovia shells exploded and gunfire crackled as 
prince johnsons fighters scoured the city for doe loyalists 
survivors from does elite presidential guard turned heavy 
artillery placed on the roof of the seaside executive mansion 
onto the rebels and the warravaged city the guns normally face 
out toward the atlantic ocean 
gambian president sir dawda jawara said does men had asked the 
fivenation west african force to help them evacuate the capital 
jawara said aid would be offered on humanitarian grounds 
i think it is now urgent to try and do something about 
protecting these 230 or so doe supporters from factional or tribal 
revenge said jawara chairman of the 16member economic 
community of west african states 
the community ordered a 3000member task force into liberia 
last month to help quell the 8monthold civil war often marked 
by tribal fighting the soldiers are from nigeria ghana guinea 
sierra leone and gambia 
jawara who was visiting zimbabwe said that rather than 
speeding the wars end does death monday likely would increase 
bloodshed 
witnesses said does mutilated body was on display at johnsons 
headquarters outside the city johnson had said doe would be 
courtmartialed but within a day of his capture sunday he was 
reported dead from gunshot wounds 
the west african force commander lt gen arnold quainoo of 
ghana said tuesday that 78 people were killed when johnsons men 
attacked does entourage on sunday among the dead was defense 
minister brig gen j boima barclay 
quainoo said in a statement doe told him he had come to express 
his surprise that quainoo had not paid him a courtesy call 
the statement said general doe talked at length to the effect 
that he was not ready to submit the sovereignty of his country to 
any power or indeed regional organization 
quainoo said doe accused the united states of destroying 
liberia doe said he feared no one and would fight to the end 
the statement said johnson and about 40 of his men then arrived 
and protested does visit an argument ensued that degenerated into 
a shootout 
quainoo and other west african officers tried to persuade 
johnson and his men to stop but failed except that they did not 
kill doe who was shot in the legs and taken away 
does removal from power had been the key demand of johnsons 
rival charles taylor but taylors spokesman tom woewiyu said 
taylor now was insisting on withdrawal of the west african force 
before accepting a truce 
plumes of smoke rose tuesday and sounds of gunfire and shelling 
echoed from eastern sinkor suburb from where taylors fighters 
again tried to move into monrovia 
it was unclear how strong taylors forces are at one point he 
claimed 10000 fighters but reporters who visited his camp said 
many insurgents have returned to their villages and those who 
remain include many young boys with no training 
taylor a former bureaucrat overran much of liberia with little 
difficulty after leading a rebel army in an invasion dec 24 but 
he has been blocked in the eastern suburbs of monrovia for more 
than two months 
johnson a former lieutenant in does army broke with taylor 
earlier this year and advanced on the capital 
in abidjan capital of ivory coast a group of johnson 
supporters took over the liberian embassy ambassador harold tarr 
and his staff abandoned the office monday after they heard doe was 
dead 
liberia has been without effective government for months since 
midjuly monrovia has been torn by fighting involving the two 
rebel armies and doe loyalists much of the capital is without food 
and water 
an interim government named at a national unity conference in 
gambia on aug 30 but rejected by taylor said tuesday it was 
sending a delegation to monrovia to prepare its installation 
sources close to amos sawyer who was named president of the 
interim government at the aug 30 conference said he was urged to 
send envoys by johnson and brig gen david nimley whom doe 
loyalists named acting president 
doe took power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist 
descendants of freed american slaves who had discriminated against 
liberian natives the rebels accused doe of misappropriation of 
state funds and other corruption 
but the civil war has been fought largely upon tribal lines doe 
was from the krahn people one of 14 small tribes in liberia 
johnson is the son of a gio and taylor is of mixed 
americoliberian and native ancestry 
americoliberians are the descendents of american slaves who 
founded liberia in 1847

a federal judge tuesday denied a motion by 
convicted spy jonathan j pollard to withdraw his 1986 guilty plea 
to selling a wide range of defense secrets to israel 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr also rejected 
allegations by harvard university law professor alan dershowitz 
that federal prosecutors improperly supplied the judge with 
information that influenced the decision to impose a life sentence 
on the former civilian navy intelligence analyst 
dershowitz based his allegation on a conversation he says he had 
last fall with former supreme court justice arthur goldberg who 
died jan 19 at the age of 81 according to court papers unsealed 
tuesday by robinson 
dershowitz said in an affidavit that goldberg told him of a 
conversation with robinson in which the judge explained why he gave 
pollard a life sentence 
goldberg quoted robinson as saying that information from 
prosecutors that pollard had sold israel us spy satellite photos 
of tests of israelimade missiles in south africa weighed 
heavily in the decision to impose a life sentence according to 
the affidavit 
in his opinion robinson denied receiving the information which 
he said was false and added that the claim of improper contact by 
prosecutors is based upon pure hearsay twice over 
the judge rejected a defense request that he retire from the 
case 
pollard received a life sentence in 1987 for his guilty plea to 
conspiracy to commit espionage 
at sentencing prosecutors said that pollard had given israel 
enough classified documents to fill a large closet 
in his motions pollard claimed that prosecutors reneged on 
their promise not to seek life sentence by framing their 
presentence arguments to ensure that robinson imposed the life 
term anyway 
prosecutors denied in court papers that they improperly gave 
robinson any information about pollards spying that was not 
produced during the trial 
the government noted that the testing of the israeli jericho 
missiles in south africa did not occur until july 1989 and 
hardly could have formed the basis of a sentencing decision made in 
1987 
we think it more likely that assuming that there was some 
conversation between chief judge robinson and justice goldberg 
that they discussed current events and that their conversation has 
been distorted in the retelling said a government brief 
dershowitz who served as one of goldbergs law clerks in the 
1960s quoted the former justice as saying that he thought that 
because robinson is black he would be particularly sensitive 
to evidence of an israelisouth african connection 
robinson did not specifically say whether he ever talked with 
goldberg about the case except to say the courts recollection 
of events is in stark contradition to that claim 
prosecutors dryly noted in their pleadings that it was 
convenient for dershowitz to claim he received information from 
someone now deceased 
this argument prompted pollards defense attorney hamilton p 
fox iii to file a separate affidavit stating that dershowitz 
contacted him almost two months before goldbergs death to relate 
the details of the conversation 
goldberg was appointed to the supreme court by president kennedy 
but resigned from the high court when president johnson named him 
ambassador to the united nations

the envoy of the arab league said tuesday 
he is resigning because he opposes arab acceptance of the usled 
military buildup in the persian gulf 
it was the second time this month a top official has announced 
his intention to step down from his post at the 21nation 
organization which is deeply torn by divisions over the gulf 
crisis 
the groups un envoy clovis maksoud appealed tuesday that 
the wound inflicted on kuwait not lead to amputation of part 
of the arab body politic 
maksoud told a news conference he can longer no longer reconcile 
his own convictions in favor of a larger arab role with arab 
acceptance of the buildup of us and foreign forces in the gulf 
he complained that arab nations were losing credibility because 
of their failure to act together he said they were becoming 
marginalized because the united states not an arab front was 
resisting iraqs occupation of kuwait 
he said arabs must seek a third way between accepting iraqi 
domination of kuwait and allowing the us military buildup 
hundreds of thousands of us and iraqi troops are poised on 
opposite sides of the kuwaitisaudi border in a standoff 
maksoud said he favored breathing space to permit an arab 
solution to what he called an arab problem including a significant 
arab military force to replace the usled military operation 
in his comments maksoud also said the gulf crisis should not 
deflect arab states from their fundamental aim of reaching a just 
settlement with israel 
maksoud a lebanese scholar who has represented the league for 
11 years at the united nations and in washington said he had 
sought unsuccessfully to resign in august because of fatigue and 
philosophical differences 
on tuesday he said he would step down but pledged to remain in 
a caretaker capacity until a successor is chosen 
on sept 3 chedli klibi of tunisia secretarygeneral of the 
arab league resigned his post 
some diplomats said he was upset about the decision to move the 
arab league headquarters back to cairo from tunis 
maksoud said his own decision had nothing to do with the cairo 
move 
egypt took the lead last month at an arab league summit in cairo 
to respond to the aug 2 invasion of kuwait a majority of members 
decided to send forces to the persian gulf to counter iraq 
in his comments tuesday maksoud said that he favors an iraqi 
withdrawal restoration of kuwaits government a pullout of 
foreign forces and a temporary deployment of an arab force

the senate on tuesday rejected president 
bushs request for money to hire 1050 more tax collectors but 
approved 804 million for a new federal courthouse in 
appropriations committee chairman robert c byrds home state 
on a 936 vote the senate approved a 207 billion 
appropriations bill covering spending by the treasury department 
postal service offices of bush and vice president dan quayle and 
several other agencies in fiscal 1991 beginning oct 1 
voting against the legislation were sens alan dixon dill 
jesse helms rnc gordon humphrey rnh trent lott rmiss 
connie mack rfla and william roth rdel 
the bill slashes the 61 billion that bush wanted to spend this 
year on buying new computers for the internal revenue service and 
expanding its enforcement capabilities by a total of 228 million 
but it adds more than 170 million for lawmakers pet projects 
in the form of new construction for the general services 
administration the governments landlord to a version the house 
approved in july 
included in that amount is the 804 million for a proposed new 
federal buildingcourthouse in charleston wva the capital of 
democrat byrds home state 
by a 6534 vote the senate effectively rejected an effort by 
sen john glenn dohio to restore bushs request for 555 
million to hire 1050 more irs agents to try to recover some of the 
estimated 96 billion in uncollected taxes and penalties owed the 
government from 1989 alone 
opponents said the amendment would violate the budget law 
without cuts in other areas 
this is not a budget buster its a revenue raiser glenn 
retorted citing estimates by congressional auditors and the irs 
that the new agents would raise at least 2 for every dollar spent 
on hiring them 
however neither glenn nor any other lawmaker mentioned the 
proposed new west virginia courthouse or other senators pet gsa 
projects in the legislation the bill now go to a conference 
between house and senate negotiators 
by a 6336 vote the senate rejected an effort by helms to put 
it on record in firm opposition to abortion as part of a united 
nations convention on the rights of children 
helms wanted to attach his measure to an amendment by sen bill 
bradley dnj urging bush to sign the un convention on the 
rights of children and sending it to the senate for ratification 
bradleys amendment was later adopted on a voice vote 
the reason we were able to get this convention passed last 
year by the united nations was that it was neutral on 
abortion bradley said urging defeat of helms measure its 
left entirely to the laws of the nations 
also adopted on a 972 vote was a nonbinding resolution by sen 
john heinz rpa saying that iraqi president saddam hussein 
should be tried as a war criminal if fighting erupts between his 
and us troops in the middle east voting against the resolution 
were sens jeff bingaman dnm and bob kerry dneb 
in addition to the irs cuts the senate also trimmed the request 
by bush and the houses appropriation for the us postal service 
by 14 million to 5087 million 
and the senate trimmed another 503 million from bushs request 
for running the white house but left intact the administrations 
recommended appropriation of 626000 for operating and renovating 
quayles governmentprovided home in washington 
the house had approved all of the 32997 million sought by bush 
for running the white house and the various executive offices such 
as the office of management and budget and the council of 
environmental quality directly under the president 
also added to the house version of the bill was a measure sought 
by government executives over the past five years to revise the 
federal pay system by linking salaries to comparable private jobs 
in various cities 
while federal pay is higher for many jobs in some lowcost 
areas nationwide it is 28 percent below the average paid by 
private businesses for identical skills according to government 
studies 
in a major compromise with the administration the bill would 
give the president authority to revise the pay system but would 
also allow him to adjust the appropriate levels downward 
the senate has estimated the cost of catching federal workers up 
to their private industry counterparts in highcost cities at 5 
billion over the next five years 
another pay amendment by sen dennis deconcini dariz added 
to the legislation would increase the wages of some 60000 federal 
law enforcement officers by 2000 to 5000 a year

the bush administration on tuesday threatened 
a veto of a 283 billion military spending bill if approved by the 
house contending the package would hamper us efforts against 
iraq in the persian gulf 
pentagon spokesman pete williams raised the veto possibility as 
the house took up the military blueprint for fiscal 1991 in a 
climate of diminishing concern about the soviet union but growing 
worry about iraqi president saddam hussein 
if the house bill is enacted in its present form then the 
presidents senior advisers and the secretary would recommend that 
the president veto it williams said at a pentagon briefing 
the bill crafted by the house armed services committee prior to 
iraqs invasion of kuwait would slash nearly 2 billion from 
president bushs request for the strategic defense initiative halt 
production of the b2 bomber and cut us troop strength by 129500 
williams singled out those provisions in particular the troop 
reduction that far exceeds the 38000 proposed by the 
administration 
that would pose an undue risk to national security greatly 
complicate the departments ability to deal with the current crisis 
in the gulf and also rob the department of the flexibility we need 
to manage the force drawdown in an effective way he said 
the pentagon spokesman also criticized a provision in the bill 
that would require the defense department to come up with a plan by 
1994 to dual base all military units permanently stationing 
all american troops in the united states and ordering shortterm 
rotations overseas 
a us withdrawal worldwide would create a potential vacuum 
and increase the potential for regional differences to turn into 
major crises williams said 
rep david ob martin rny sponsor of an amendment to 
eliminate the dualbasing provision said if the measure isnt a 
return to isolationism i dont know what would be 
the house planned to take up that issue wednesday as well as 
several amendments requiring us allies to share a larger portion 
of the cost of stationing troops overseas 
the main proponent of dualbasing rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo said last week that the recent deployment of us troops 
to the gulf strengthens her argument 
were much better off keeping people in the united states 
rather than these very expensive forward deployed locations 
said schroeder who chairs the house armed services subcommittee on 
military installations and facilities 
in action on the bill tuesday the house rejected an amendment 
that would have forced the navy to close the planned home port 
battleship base at new york citys staten island an installation 
in which the pentagon has invested more than 230 million 
by a vote of 230188 the house approved a measure that would 
prevent closure until after a pentagon plan on naval installations 
is submitted to congress 
the decision was a victory for rep susan molinari rny a 
lawmaker who has served in the house for just six months and a 
defeat for rep charles bennett dfla a senior member of the 
house armed services committee and chairman of the seapower 
subcommittee 
molinari who represents staten island argued that the facility 
is more than 95 percent complete and singling out one installation 
for closing would undermine the allornone base closure process 
adopted by the house several years ago 
your military installation could be next molinari warned 
members always conscious of projects in their home districts 
she shared her victory with her father guy a former member and 
the staten island borough president who made a rare appearance in 
the house to help his daughter 
the house also overwhelmingly approved a measure sponsored by 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass to create a professional work 
corps within the pentagon to purchase weapons and other 
defenserelated items 
meanwhile a group of house republicans reaffirmed opposition to 
the bill saying that the 24 billion cut from bushs request of 
307 billion in military spending for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 threatens the security of the united states 
in a statement issued after a meeting with defense secretary 
dick cheney the house republican policy committee said the bills 
cuts in strategic modernization and personnel could seriously 
jeopardize our nations ability to undertake military operations 
similar to operation desert shield now under way in saudi arabia 
democrats however hailed the legislation as an appropriate 
response to the changing threat to the west 
the house armed services committee has fashioned a bill that 
makes real progress toward restructuring united states military 
forces to meet changing circumstances of the 1990s and beyond 
rep charles bennett dfla said during debate on the house floor

two suspected colombian drug traffickers 
were extradited to the united states on tuesday the first such 
extraditions since president cesar gaviria took office last month 
jose hilario ortiz and raul hernan buchelli who both face drug 
trafficking charges in the united states were placed on board a 
us drug enforcement administration plane bound for miami 
national police chief gen miguel gomez said in remarks broadcast 
by the rcn radio network 
ortiz faces drug trafficking charges in connecticut and buchelli 
is wanted in florida said a police spokesman requesting 
anonymity no further details were immediately available 
buchelli is wanted on charges of conspiracy to smuggle and 
distribute heroin and money laundering while ortiz pleaded guilty 
to a cocaine trafficking conspiracy charge and fled the country 
before sentencing according to us court records 
buchellis brother guido lucio also faces drug trafficking 
charges in the united states but he was released last week after 
the government rejected a us request for his extradition citing 
insufficient evidence 
colombia has extradited 24 suspected drug traffickers to the 
united states since august 1989 when the government launched a 
major antidrug crackdown after the murder of a presidential 
candidate 
twelve of those extradited have either been convicted at trial 
or pleaded guilty one was acquitted an additional nine are 
awaiting trial 
the crackdown prompted the medellin cocaine cartel to declare 
total war on the government a year ago 
tuesdays extraditions were the first of suspected drug 
traffickers to the united states since gaviria was inaugurated aug 
7 he has pledged to continue the war against the cocaine cartels 
waged by his predecessor virgilio barco 
last wednesday gaviria modified the countrys extradition 
policy 
in a nationally televised speech gaviria said drug traffickers 
who turn themselves in and confess their crimes would be tried in 
colombia and not face extradition to the united states 
under the decree announced by gaviria colombian judges would be 
also empowered to impose shorter sentences for suspects who confess 
and cooperate with local investigations 
the countrys drug barons have so far offered no reply to 
gavirias offer 
gavirias offer appeared to be at least in part a response to 
repeated offers from the drug traffickers to surrender to colombian 
judges in return for a promise to end the extraditions that had 
been resumed last year by barco 
the drug traffickers have feared extradition to the united 
states because they would have little influence over the judicial 
process there cocaine cartel members have traditionally been able 
to either bribe or threaten their way out of colombian jails 
judges who refuse to be intimidated have often been slain 
in his speech last week gaviria announced that three colombians 
would soon be extradited to the united states but he said three 
other us extradition requests had been turned down 
the third suspect set to be extradited joaquin oswaldo gallo 
chamorro was still being held in colombia on tuesday authorities 
did not say why he was not sent to the united states with ortiz and 
buchelli 
with the latest extraditions the us justice department is 
still seeking to extradite 14 suspected drug traffickers held in 
colombia 
colombias cali and medellin drug cartels supply most of the 
cocaine consumed in the united states and europe authorities blame 
the medellin for killing about 550 colombians the past year 
including three presidential candidates

the senate overwhelmingly approved a 
resolution tuesday saying the united states should prosecute saddam 
hussein and other iraqi leaders as war criminals if hostilities 
break out in the persian gulf 
the nonbinding resolution passed on a 972 vote declared that 
saddam has violated standards of civilized conduct by willfully 
seeking to endanger the lives of foreign civilians in kuwait and 
iraq 
the resolution was passed just hours before president bush was 
appearing before a joint house and senate session to report on the 
crisis triggered by saddams invasion and occupation of neighboring 
kuwait 
it is the sense of the senate that in the event of hostilities 
between the united states and the government of iraq it shall be 
the policy of the united states to pursue saddam hussein and other 
such perpetrators as may be determined responsible in order to 
bring them to justice as war criminals it said 
sen john heinz rpa the principal sponsor told his 
colleagues the most important way that we can safeguard our 
hostages against any kind of harm coming to them in the future is 
for the senate to go on record by a recorded overwhelming vote 
if saddam hussein and his henchmen place the hostages in 
harms way in the event of hostilities heinz said we will see 
to it that they are tried as war criminals just as surely as the 
nazi war criminals were tried convicted and sent to punishment in 
nuremberg 
sen bob kerrey dneb said he shared the frustration of his 
colleagues over the plight of americans still in iraq and kuwait 
but said the resolution was reckless 
i appreciate this is a sort of an amendment that looks 
relatively harmless kerrey said but it seems to be its 
possible given that weve heard over and over and over that there 
are people in this world that pay attention to our resolutions 
that this sends precisely the opposite message 
im concerned for hostages everyone is he said but what 
happens if this in fact sends precisely the opposite message im 
not skilled in the psychology of somebody who takes hostages and 
holds them 
heinz countered that this senator does not want to take the 
chance that by inaction by our failure to speak out that we 
would run the very considerable risk that he saddam might once 
again misread the intentions of those of us who have legitimate 
concerns 
sen david pryor dark said he thought the resolution was 
premature and asked heinz whether the administration had requested 
it 
heinz replied that he had consulted with administration 
officials and that no objections had been raised 
in the end and there will be an end saddam hussein will not 
prevail he said and it is important for him to know that when 
he comes to the end of this story that justice will be done that 
message is probably the best message we can send against the kind 
of mistreatment of our hostages that took place in iran 
sen jeff bingaman dnm joined kerrey in voting against the 
resolution which was an amendment to a 207 billion 
appropriations bill financing treasury department postal service 
white house and other federal agencies

the quebec government on tuesday rejected an 
offer from mohawks holed up in this town west of montreal to end a 
twomonth impasse by surrendering 
in a brief statement by premier robert bourassa the government 
called the proposal unacceptable because it contradicts 
fundamental principles of democracy and our justice system 
there is no question of a special category of individuals 
receiving treatment under the law different from any other citizen 
of quebec the statement said 
the mohawk offer hinged on creation of a special commission that 
would exercise ultimate authority for determining any criminal 
charges the panel would produce a final report within 60 days 
the mohawk proposal called for the commission to be composed of 
iroquois canadians quebecers and international human rights 
delegates 
it would oversee the surrender of about 50 indians in a 
drugtreatment center at the kahnesatake community in oka about 18 
miles from montreal said oneida leader bob antone 
the mohawks about half warriors and half women and children 
retreated to the center on sept 1 when the army moved onto the 
mohawk settlement 
mohawks from kahnesatake have been in a standoff with quebec 
police and the canadian army since july over the attempt by oka 
officials to expand a golf course on land the indians claim as 
ancestral 
on july 11 provincial police tried to storm a mohawk barricade 
one officer was killed but it is not clear by whose gunfire 
another community of mohawks had blockaded a key montreal bridge 
in sympathy with the kahnesatake indians but that bridge was 
reopened last week

a plan to tax northwestern university 
students will likely die in coming days but curing the bad blood 
that has developed between the city and school probably will take 
longer officials said tuesday 
i think its a matter of getting people to talk more said 
university spokesman ken wildes but then i guess communications 
is usually the problem 
in what city clerk kirsten davis called an act of 
desperation the city council in this north chicago suburb of 
75000 voted 108 monday to assess a tuition tax on students at 
northwestern and three other colleges it would amount to up to 60 
a year per student 
mayor joan barr immediately said she would veto the ordinance 
the veto message will likely be put before the council at its 
sept 24 meeting and theres little chance the twothirds majority 
could be mustered for an override ms davis said 
the measure makes evanston the first community in the nation to 
impose a student tuition tax according to the american council on 
education council members said the tax was needed to compensate 
the city for revenue lost through the schools property tax 
exemptions 
the measure would apply to three other schools besides 
northwestern kendall college garrett evangelical theological 
seminary and seaburywestern theological seminary 
but debate has centered on the citys bestknown school and 
officials say mondays vote was just a symptom of a longstanding 
disagreement between the university and the lakefront community 
which estimates the tax would generate 500000 a year 
this whole tuition tax would have gone away if arnold weber 
had gotten up and promised something some little thing ms 
davis said referring to northwesterns president it could be a 
fire engine it could be lower tuition for residents it could be 
creating a series of management seminars for city department heads 
just something to give us the feeling they would be good 
corporate citizens 
city officials complain that northwestern has refused to pay a 
fee for city services such as police and fire protection it pays 
no property taxes on 242 acres of universityowned land and 
buildings including some commercial property and has refused to 
make a financial contribution to its host community ms davis said 
there are a lot of little things they could have done she 
said but everything weve asked theyve said no 
evanston officials have estimated the city could have a 25 
million budget deficit for the fiscal year starting in march and 
its estimated that city residents already pay 25 percent more in 
property taxes because the schools are exempt ms davis said 
this problem has been a subject of discussion for probably 10 
years she said adding that a tax like the one passed monday has 
twice been rejected by the council 
but northwesterns wildes said the last time a tax was 
considered the city and university resolved the issue by agreeing 
to work together toward economic development in evanston 
he said that since 1983 the university has poured 25 
million into such ventures including a 26acre research park 
that helps fledgling businesses wildes said there havent been any 
conversations about additional contributions from northwestern 
since then 
northwestern officials also have noted that the school is the 
largest employer in the city and generates millions of dollars in 
business for local merchants they also say they pay almost 1 
million in utility taxes plus a tax on sales of tickets to 
athletic events 
at mondays meeting weber called the tax antieducation and 
antibusiness adding that more than 50 percent of the students 
already receive extensive financial aid most of the schools 
nearly 10500 students are undergraduates who pay an annual tuition 
of 13725

the agriculture department is making it easier 
for farmers to pay back the advance subsidies they received for 
crops later lost to drought 
the agricultural stabilization and conservation service had a 
policy that farmers had to pay the money back all at once unless 
they proved that would keep them from feeding or sheltering their 
families 
however the conservation service decided last month to offer 
installment plans to farmers who can show a onetime payment would 
create an undue financial hardship the payments can be 
stretched over three years at 9 percent interest according to the 
conservation service 
county conservation service offices were notified of the policy 
change on aug 22 
were trying to find a way so that those who need help can get 
relief and work it out in three years said keith bjerke 
administrator of the service 
the government has collected more than 500 million of the 840 
million in advance payments that farmers must pay back for 1988 and 
1989 bjerke said 
advance deficiency payments for 1988 and 1989 were supposed to 
be paid back by july 31 unless the farmer pays the money back or 
works out an installment plan the government can recover the money 
by taking it out of future payments or loans 
farmers and members of congress had been pressuring the 
conservation service to relax its repayment policy 
the senate version of the 1990 farm bill contains a provision 
that is more lenient than the new policy the conservation service 
would be required to offer installment plans to any farmer in a 
county that received a disaster declaration for two of the previous 
three years farmers in adjacent counties also would qualify 
however the farm bill is not expected to become law before 
october

imprisoning a 77yearold woman because 
she failed to tell where her daughter has been hiding with her two 
children shows the us court system at its worst womens rights 
advocates said tuesday 
superior court judge mark a pfeiffer on monday sent mary pigeon 
to prison for an indefinite term saying he would release her only 
if she tells where her daughter and granddaughters are 
im really concerned about the inappropriateness of this type 
of technique to squeeze information out of a 77yearold woman 
said lynn heufelder director of the womens resource center in 
newport 
the rhode island womens political caucus said the incarceration 
shows the judicial system at its worst 
the judge has shown little wisdom no compassion and dangerous 
rigidity said elizabeth morancy chairwoman of the caucus 
pfeiffer should have considered home confinement as an 
alternative she said 
the national organization for womens rhode island affiliate 
also objected to the decision its president susan luckel said 
we think its reprehensible she said adding the group 
would discuss the case at its thursday meeting 
elaine yates and the children kimberly ann then 3 and kelly 
ann then 10 months left their warwick home in august 1985 after 
mrs yates found her husband with another woman on the family boat 
ms morancy said mrs pigeons plight was a family rights issue 
a sentiment echoed by ms heufelder 
it seems to me at this point that the government is preying on 
the family relationship and to pick on a 70plusyearoldwoman for 
a decision made by her daughter is not right ms heufelder said 
russell m yates jr later acknowledged hitting his wife and 
cutting her forehead with a diamond ring when they argued about the 
boat incident after she left he sued for custody of the children 
and won when his wife did not contest the lawsuit he then sued 
mrs pigeon seeking the girls return 
the couple has not divorced yates says he does not want to give 
his wife the legal opportunity to change her and the girls names 
a year ago pfeiffer ordered mrs pigeon to tell her soninlaw 
where his wife and daughters are and to pay 23000 in damages no 
money has been paid 
when mondays deadline came with no disclosure of the familys 
whereabouts pfeiffer said he was left with no alternative but 
to send mrs pigeon to jail for contempt of court 
i have no desire to punish this woman he said 
mrs pigeon has maintained she does not know where her daughter 
took her granddaughters pfeiffer says he believes otherwise 
i feel very sad about it and i wish elaine would come home 
mrs pigeon said after the sentencing 
mrs pigeon was working at the adult correctional institutions 
spokesman joseph dinitto said 
shes down in our kitchen dinitto said its very light 
janitorial work sweeping floors stuff like that

former vermont gov richard a snellings comeback bid got off 
to a fast start tuesday as he swept to the republican nomination 
for the office he once held for four terms also trying a comeback 
was ousted gov evan mecham of arizona 
in the nations capital jesse jackson was making his first run 
for an office other than president 
arizona republicans were deciding whether to give mecham another 
shot at the office he lost 2 years ago through impeachment 
preelection polls showed him trailing phoenix developer j fife 
symington former phoenix mayor terry goddard was heavily favored 
to emerge as the democratic nominee 
incumbents challenged within their own parties included gov 
rudy perpich of minnesota and rep roy dyson of maryland both 
democrats 
vermonts lone congressman republican peter smith was 
challenged by conservative timothy philbin who pledged to serve 
only one term if elected 
snelling who defeated richard gottlieb will face democrat 
peter welch who also overwhelmed his primary opponent william 
gwin 
with 3 percent of precincts reporting snelling had 2415 votes 
or 88 percent and gottlieb had 345 votes or 12 percent welch had 
2051 votes or 93 percent and gwin had 154 votes or 7 percent 
people went to the polls in 10 states and the district of 
columbia but politics had a low priority among americans whose 
attention was riveted on events in the persian gulf 
three republican governors judd gregg of new hampshire edward 
diprete of rhode island and tommy thompson of wisconsin had 
token primary opposition 
with polls indicating diprete is vulnerable three democrats 
mayors joseph paolino of providence and francis flaherty of warwick 
and businessman bruce sundlun were competing to run against him 
in the race to succeed democrat william oneill as governor of 
connecticut rep bruce morrison and state legislator william cibes 
faced off in the democratic primary 
after serving four twoyear terms as governor of vermont 
snelling a republican decided not to run again in 1984 he was 
succeeded by democrat madeleine kunin who announced her retirement 
this year 
snelling and democrat peter welch had token opposition for their 
party nominations 
the list of politicians attempting comebacks also included 
former sen john durkin of new hampshire and excongressmen edward 
beard of rhode island dan marriott of utah and 85yearold john 
dow of new york 
perpich ridiculed as governor goofy by his critics was 
challenged by his former commerce commissioner mike hatch for the 
democratfarmerlabor nomination 
minnesota republicans had an equally spirited contest with 
auditor arne carlson and businessman jon grunseth the 
frontrunners carlson led preelection polls despite the fact 
grunseth had the endorsement of the independentrepublican party 
leadership 
dyson came under criticism for his ties to defense contractors 
and recently the hawkish congressmans prospects were further 
shaken by disclosure that he was a conscientious objector during 
the vietnam war his chief democratic opponent was state legislator 
barbara kreamer eight republicans were lined up to challenge dyson 
in november and a recent poll said any one of them could beat him 
durkin who served one sixyear senate term and then was 
defeated for reelection in 1980 was seeking the democratic 
nonmination for the seat now held by republican sen gordon 
humphrey durkins principal primary opponents were nashua mayor 
james donchess and businessman john rauh 
rep bob smith and lawyer tom christo were competing for the gop 
nomination to succeed humphrey 
after 12 years in the us senate humphrey announced he was 
ready to leave washington to run for a seat in the new hampshire 
senate but his path to the state legislature wasnt clear state 
rep jack sherburne waged a vigorous campaign for the nomination 
calling humphrey a converted extremist who was largely 
ineffective in the us senate 
in the new hampshire democratic gubernatorial primary former 
state party chairman joe grandmaison was favored to overcome two 
rivals who have attacked him for his ties to massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis 
beard lost his house seat in 1980 to republican claudine 
schneider who is running against democratic sen claiborne pell 
dow last served new york in the house in 1972 his primary 
opponent sean obrien strub is homosexual the primary winner 
would challenge republican rep benjamin gilman 
marriott who served four terms in congress before losing a 1984 
bid for governor was competing against genevieve atwood for the 
chance to challenge democratic rep wayne owens in november 
jackson was running in a democratic primary for nomination to 
the symbolic office of shadow senator from the district of 
columbia voters in the nations capital will elect two 
senators and one representative positions with no official 
standing and created to lobby congress to support statehood for the 
city 
five candidates were competing for the democratic nomination to 
succeed marion barry as washingtons mayor barry awaiting 
sentencing on a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge has said he 
plans to run as an independent for an atlarge seat on the city 
council 
the race to succeed walter fauntroy as the district of 
columbias nonvoting delegate in the house was abruptly 
spotlighted last weekend when frontrunner eleanor holmes norton 
conceded that she and her husband failed to file city income tax 
returns over an eightyear period 
norton a law professor and former carter administration 
official said her husband did the family taxes and she signed the 
returns but he never mailed them

in last weeks miss america pageant 
a judge at the pageant in atlantic city nj he named ms 
wynne the homliest of the bunch during an appearance monday on 
the joan rivers show 
she was one of the 10 finalists and she did a great 
ventriloquist bit the dummy was prettier he said 
he was kidding said eileen murphy a spokeswoman for 
larry king live on cnn he was on the show with joan rivers 
joans a comedian he reacted to her in a comedic way he regrets 
the incident and he apologizes 
in retrospect he realizes it was not funny she said he 
certainly did not mean to be offensive 
king sent a dozen longstemmed red roses and a telegram to ms 
wynne apologizing for his comments which he said were made in 
jest with no intention to offend 
you are a bright shining talent king wrote half the 
women in america would kill to be in your shoes in this case im 
the real dummy 
after kings remarks ms wynnes father gary wynne of easton 
told waebam radio tuesday the family and the miss pennsylvania 
pageant were considering unspecified legal action 
the contestants mother marlene wynne said the apology was 
necessary but it needed to go further

has hurt her very deeply and he has hurt many other people

had the right to express an opinion 
ms wynne was invited to appear on rivers show said dennis 
stewart chairman of the miss pennsylvania scholarship pageant inc 
he said they were discussing an appearance later in the week 
if people get a chance to see her thats as much as a 
rebuttal to what larry said stewart said

any girl who was on that stage in his position as a judge i think 
is contemptible

soviet prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov denied 
charges tuesday that he took advantage of his post to buy a country 
home for a fraction of its value 
the allegations worsened ryzhkovs problems on a day when he 
suffered heavy criticism in the national parliament for his 
economic reform plans 
komsomolskaya pravda one of the nations largest newspapers 
said tuesday that the prime minister had paid 47000 rubles for a 
country home known as a dacha outside moscow 
the official exchange rate for the ruble is about 160 or 16 
cents depending on the transaction 
however in his comments to the supreme soviet ryzhkov said 
we do not own a dacha he said he lives in a governmentowned 
dacha reserved for the prime minister 
however ryzhkov said he had considered buying his own home 
recently because he was tired of public complaints about special 
privileges for officials 
i did have such a thought in order to live as a free man 
he said but he said he could not afford the 300000ruble price on 
his government dacha 
because most soviets live in cramped apartments with no hope of 
ever owning their own home official dachas are a particular sore 
point 
komsomolskaya pravda said ryzhkov was out buying a dacha while 
vigorously fighting proposals to legalize private land the 
proposals would allow millions of soviets to join him as residents 
of singlefamily homes 
the newspaper also said that as prime minister ryzhkov had 
unique access to his pick of dachas near moscow where demand far 
outstrips supply

citrus growers eager to bounce back from a 
subpar harvest got some good news tuesday when federal agriculture 
officials dropped a 6yearold quarantine 
floridas billiondollar citrus industry hoping for a sunnier 
future after a crippling christmas freeze also welcomed an 
optimistic report on increased citrus planting 
the us agriculture department announced that as of sept 18 it 
will officially remove the remaining citruscanker quarantine 
restrictions imposed in september 1984 
we were pleased to see it said dan gunter executive 
director of the florida department of citrus this will open up 
all the markets to florida it was time for the usda to 
deregulate 
federal quarantine restrictions came after an outbreak of a 
leafspotting disease in dozens of citrus nurseries it was 
believed to be a rapidly spreading asiatic strain of citrus canker 
which can devastate groves 
more than 20 million young trees were uprooted and burned 
before scientists determined that the disease was not spreading to 
mature groves and did not constitute a major threat to fruit or to 
other citrusproducing states 
restrictions were gradually relaxed after followup research 
showed that the disease was only distantly related to asiatic 
canker 
lack of faith in florida citrus brought on by the canker 
quarantine cost growers dearly said bobby mckown executive vice 
president of florida citrus mutual the largest growers trade 
association in the state 
he called it a major step forward for the citrus industry 
its been a long six years since the quarantine was first imposed 
meanwhile a biennial survey conducted by state and federal 
officials showed a 5 percent increase in citrus acreage despite 
nearly 86000 acres lost because of the christmas freeze 
thats good news a very encouraging report gunter said 
commercial citrus acreage increased to 732767 acres 5 percent 
more than the 697929 acres reported in 1988 according to the 
report 
growers planted 120696 acres in 1988 and 1989 they lost 85858 
acres of trees most of it to the december freeze leaving a net 
gain of 34838 
the 198990 orange harvest projected before the december freeze 
at 130 million 90pound boxes came in at about 110 million boxes 
it was the decades secondlowest production 
the grapefruit crop of about 36 million boxes was the smallest 
since the 196768 season 
the canker scare prompted other citrus states including texas 
and california to ban imports of florida fruit that was not 
inspected and treated before being shipped 
connie riherd assistant director of the florida agriculture 
departments division of plant industry said she hoped that other 
citrusproducing states take the federal lead and not impose 
their own regulations against florida fruit 
the wealth of biological information that has been reviewed 
by federal and state scientists shows that the nursery strain of 
the disease is not of quarantine significance mrs riherd said 
the cankereradication effort led to some 60 lawsuits by nursery 
owners who suffered losses because of the destruction of their 
young trees at last report these lawsuits totaled about 200 
million and the state was still trying to negotiate with litigants 
and impose some courtordered settlements 
the cost of the cankereradication battle to the industry and 
state and federal agencies exceeded 100 million 
this shows positive results following a major freeze said 
harry whittaker of the florida agricultural statistics service 
which compiled the survey results we see continued interest by 
growers in new plantings

aircraft could be better designed to survive 
explosions but there will never be a bombproof jumbo jet according 
to a government report released tuesday on the terrorist bombing of 
pan am flight 103 
the air accidents investigation branch reported that the pan am 
boeing 747 broke apart within three seconds of the explosion of a 
bomb in a forward baggage compartment leading to the deaths of 270 
people on dec 21 1988 
none of the 259 people aboard the aircraft appeared to have been 
fatally injured by the initial explosion or by fire aboard the 
aircraft the report said eleven people were killed on the ground 
in lockerbie scotland 
it should be possible to limit the damage caused by an 
explosive device inside a baggage container on a boeing 747 or 
similar aircraft to a degree which would allow the aircraft to land 
successfully albeit with severe local damage and perhaps resulting 
in some loss of life or injuries said the report 
the report said the plane which had just reached a cruising 
altitude of 31000 feet rapidly disintegrated following the 
explosion 
the investigators urged that aircraft manufacturers and 
government regulatory agencies consider various design changes 
including skin panels that would blow away cleanly venting an 
explosion without leading to the tearing away of more skin 
the report was limited to structural and technical issues and 
did not address questions of airport security 
in renton wash a spokeswoman for the boeing commerical 
airplane group said the aircraft company would review the reports 
recommendations even though the company has never specifically 
studied how to structurally strengthen its planes to withstand a 
bomb explosion 
its boeings feeling that the only way to prevent an 
explosive from destroying a plane is to avoid allowing the 
explosive to be placed on the plane in the first place said 
spokeswoman elizabeth reese what youre asking the manufacturer 
to do is respond to unknowns how do you design a plane to become 
terroristproof 
the police investigation into the bombing continues a public 
inquiry is to open in dumfries scotland on oct 1 to investigate 
the circumstances that led to the deaths 
chief constable george esson of the dumfries and galloway 
constabulary confirmed in december that ahmed jibrils radical 
palestinian group the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command had been under investigation 
esson also confirmed investigators interest in mohammed abu 
talb a member of another radical palestinian group who was 
convicted in sweden of being involved in bombings against american 
and israeli targets in europe 
some authorities believe the bombing was carried out by a 
terrorist group working on behalf of iran in retaliation for the 
shooting down of an iranian passenger plane over the persian gulf 
by a us warship 
scottish police reported in february 1989 that the new 
yorkbound 747 was brought down by a bomb consisting of semtex 
plastic explosives hidden inside a radiocassette recorder they 
said the recorder was probably checked aboard the flight in 
frankfurt west germany 
the explosive device was inside a luggage container that was 
loaded in the forward hold and was about 25 inches from the 
aircrafts skin the report said 
the explosion blew a large hole in the fuselage structure and 
shattered the main cabin floor the report said large cracks 
spread as pressurized air blew out of the rupture 
the main body of the aircraft rolled left and down while the 
nose snapped off to the right and struck the no 3 engine knocking 
it free the investigators said 
the disintegrating main body of the aircraft including the fuel 
tanks fell on the town of lockerbie at speeds up to 300 mph 
causing fires and a huge explosion the report said 
the investigators led by da cooper chief inspector of air 
accidents recommended that aircraft be designed to channel the 
force of any explosion to sections of the skin designed to burst 
cleanly without causing further structural damage 
the report also suggested strengthening the floor over the 
baggage compartment and filling internal cavities with energy 
absorbing materials 
even then the investigators said there was no guarantee that 
an aircraft would survive an explosion 
the report said such variable factors as the size of the 
explosive charge and the location of the bomb make it unrealistic 
to expect to neutralize successfully the effect of every potential 
explosive device likely to be placed on board an aircraft 
the investigators also called for new designs for flight data 
and voice recorders the ones aboard flight 103 failed instantly 
and captured no data about the explosion the report said

republicans or democrats we are only and proudly americans 
the president has asked for our support he has it the effort 
will not be easy it involves burdens and bravery perhaps more of 
each than any of us can now predict the end of what john kennedy 
called the long twilight struggle has not put an end to the 
darkness of aggression and conflict 
yet as americans we enter this new world with a remarkable 
degree of purpose and confidence here at home the sense of unity 
and the absence of widespread opposition to this action in the 
persian gulf testify to our powerful instinctive feeling that this 
is a cause worth standing and fighting for 
we are standing and if necessary we will fight because a 
vital national interest is at stake we cannot and will not permit 
the invading forces of a fanatical regime to control half of all 
the oil reserves which are the lifeblood of the world economy 
yet more is involved here than national interest as important 
as that is there has been and there always should be a moral 
component of american foreign policy this has sometimes been 
criticized as weakness in truth it is our greatest strength when 
our policy has a moral center we gain the unbreakable resolve that 
comes from standing for things we believe in 
so we are now in the persian gulf not simply for oil or to save 
emirs and kings but to defend the most fundamental values of a 
more stable and decent world we defending basic rights of 
families to be safe in their homes of nations to be secure within 
their borders of individuals to travel freely and without fear 
the tyrant who rampaged into kuwait has also murdered his own 
citizens with poison gas plotted to acquire nuclear weapons waged 
genocide against a minority people and now taken hostage thousands 
of men women and children

to watch him on television touching the head of a hostage child 
stuns and then outrages us 
firmly clearly and unequivocally we must say to saddam 
hussein let our people go let kuwait go and if you start a war 
know that we will finish it 
we have learned before that the large conflicts which engulf the 
world begin from small and unanswered aggressions if the civilized 
world had looked the other way the iraqi war machine could have 
rolled across the arabian peninsula it would be only a matter of 
time until iraq had ballistic missiles with chemical biological 
and nuclear warheads that could reach israel egypt and europe 
itself 
but this time other nations have acted in time 
among them is the soviet union a nation we did not often praise 
in the years of the cold war from the summit at helsinki where 
president gorbachev and president bush stood in common purpose we 
could see beyond the present shadows of war in the middle east to a 
new world order where the strong work together to deter and stop 
aggression 
this was precisely franklin roosevelt and winston churchills 
vision of peace for the postwar period their hope suspended in 
time for fifty years of cold war has come alive in this new 
postcommunist era 
america is still the leader the only power capable of 
summoning a grand and global alliance on the scale we have seen in 
operation desert shield but it is not enough for other nations 
just to share our commitment they must also share the burden 
when bangladesh is putting troops in harms war so should our 
powerful and prosperous allies 
when japan germany and other nato countries depend far more 
heavily of mideast oil than we do they can and should contribute 
to defend their own vital interests in the persian gulf 
when countries like egypt can stand beside us when young 
americans stand on front lines only miles from the threat of 
poison gas the least the japanese and germans can do is support us 
and not just with words they must respond to our potential 
sacrifice of lives with at least a financial sacrifice of their own

we are there because it is right but it is also right to tell 
our friends that they too have to stand up to international 
immorality and aggression the united states will do its part and 
we will also insist that other countries carry their share of the 
struggle 
we have not finished the job but how powerful are the signs of 
a new world coming today we can see egyptian or saudi troops 
wearing hungarian gas masks or carrying russian rifles standing 
guard in the desert next to a pfc from pittsburgh who is wearing a 
chemicalproof suit made in israel the infamy of saddam hussein 
has made us united nations in deed as well as name 
but ultimately for america to lead the world we must put our 
own economic house in order for as another american president 
reminded us we cannot be strong abroad if we are weak at home 
for a decade america has been left with no real energy policy at 
all it is time for energy security more production more 
conservation more support for new forms of fuel but our aim 
cannot be to make america safe for isolationism rather we must 
secure americas capacity to act overseas without maximum damage 
from an oil embargo this nation must not be permanently faced with 
a choice between standing up against aggression or standing still 
in gas lines 
economic strength also demands action on the budget deficit 
to help the president write a budget we democrats have offered 
cuts in domestic programs while trying to protect the most 
important ones but we will never abandon the cause of working 
families they benefited the least from the decade of the 80s they 
should not have to sacrifice the most in the decade of the 90s 
they already pay for government their student loans have already 
been cut and their sons and daughters are at risk in the persian 
gulf 
the standard of fairness should also be applied to president 
bushs commitment to raise taxes the working people who got almost 
nothing from the tax cuts of the past must not be asked to pay most 
of the tax increases of today just as we must ask wealthy nations 
to pay their fair share to deter aggression so we must ask wealthy 
americans to pay their fair share to prevent recession and reduce 
our debts 
beyond this we must be vigorous in shaping the defense policy 
that we now need one that is more relevant and more responsive

we can and will afford weapons critical to efforts like 
operation desert shield tanks precision missiles and fast sealift 
but star wars the b2 bomber and the mx missile are costly 
systems designed for a cold war that we have already won we can 
and must reduce the part of the pentagon budget that is nothing 
more than shadowboxing with the past 
but for all of us tonight our deepest concern is for the most 
fundamental realities the hundreds of american families with a 
loved one held hostage the hundred thousand young americans in 
uniform daughters sons husbands wives and friends who have 
been so swiftly sent to saudi arabia a few days ago on a trip to 
that country i saw them transforming the trackless desert sand 
into the frontier of international defense 
i spoke with a solider who described telephone lines melting in 
the saudi sun pilots told me of cockpit temperatures reaching 140 
degrees 
there was another young man who was supposed to be married next 
sunday but his wedding must wait before toasting his bride he 
will be drinking six to seven gallons of water each day just to 
survive the unyielding heat 
none of the young men and women i met doubted their mission 
they react to such problems as sand blowing into a machine or a 
gearshift with that remarkable american sense of ingenuity they 
respond to frustration with that irreverent american sense of 
humor they worry most about their families worrying about them 
randy king of arkansas handed me a scribbled note for his 
mother doing fine having no problems please write love ya 
randy 
and ronald lloyd of idaho spoke for most of the troops when he 
asked me to tell his family to send stamps and cookies and 
plenty of both 
their courage commands our support we will stand behind them as 
one indivisible nation 
we will challenge other countries to match their resolve and 
sacrifice 
we will insist that to ignore aggression is to invite aggression 
we will try to solve this crisis peacefully but without 
appeasement 
and if our soldiers have to fight we will make sure they win 
tonight that is our common purpose and our prayer for them 
and for our country

so if ever there was a time to put country before self and 
patriotism before party that time is now let me thank all 
americans especially those in this chamber for your support for 
our forces and their mission 
that support will be even more important in the days to come 
so tonight i want to talk to you about what is at stake what 
we must do together to defend civilized values around the world 
and maintain our economic strength at home 
our objectives in the persian gulf are clear our goals defined 
and familiar 
iraq must withdraw from kuwait completely immediately and 
without condition 
kuwaits legitimate government must be restored 
the security and stability of the persian gulf must be assured 
americans citizens abroad must be protected 
these goals are not ours alone they have been endorsed by the 
un security council five times in as many weeks most countries 
share our concern for principle and many have a stake in the 
stability of the persian gulf this is not as saddam hussein would 
have it the united states against iraq it is iraq against the 
world 
as you know ive just returned from a very productive meeting 
with soviet president gorbachev i am pleased that we are working 
together to build a new relationship in helsinki our joint 
statement affirmed to the world our shared resolve to counter 
iraqs threat to peace let me quote we are united in the belief 
that iraqs aggression must not be tolerated no peaceful 
international order is possible if larger states can devour their 
smaller neighbors 
clearly no longer can a dictator count on eastwest 
confrontation to stymie concerted un action against aggression 
a new partnership of nations has begun 
we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment the crisis 
in the persian gulf as grave as it is also offers a rare 
opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation out 
of these troubled times our fifth objective a new world order 
can emerge a new era freer from the threat of terror stronger 
in the pursuit of justice and more secure in the quest for peace 
an era in which the nations of the world east and west north and 
south can prosper and live in harmony 
a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to 
peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human 
endeavor today that new world is struggling to be born a world 
quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of 
law supplants the rule of the jungle a world where the rule of law 
supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations 
recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a 
world where the strong respect the rights of the weak 
this is the vision i shared with president gorbachev in 
helsinki he and other leaders from europe the gulf and around 
the world understand that how we manager this crisis today could 
shape the future for generations to come

liberal us rep bruce a morrison

percent or 41879 votes to cibes 39 percent or 26536 votes 
for the first time in a generation democrats are heading into 
the fall elections as clear underdogs largely because of the 
states flagging economy and recordsetting tax increases over the 
past two years 
democratic gov william a oneill decided in march not to seek 
a third term 
morrison tried to paint cibes as an oneill crony responsible 
for the tax increases and has criticized cibes call for a state

second the congress should this month enact a prudent 
multiyear defense program one that reflects not only the 
improvement in eastwest relations but our broader 
responsibilities to deal with the continuing risks of outlaw action 
and regional conflict even with our obligations in the gulf a 
sound defense budget can have some reduction in real terms and we 
are prepared to accept that but to go beyond such levels where 
cutting defense would threaten our vital margin of safety is 
something i will never accept 
the world is still dangerous surely that is now clear 
stability is not secure american interests are farreaching 
interdependence has increased the consequences of regional 
instability can be global this is no time to risk americas 
capacity to protect her vital interests 
third the congress should this month enact measures to 
increase domestic energy production and energy conservation in 
order to reduce dependence on foreign oil these measures should 
include my proposals to increase incentives for domestic oil and 
gas exploration fuelswitching and to accelerate the development 
of alaskan energy resources without damage to wildlife 
as you know when the oil embargo was imposed in the early 
1970s the united states imported almost 6 million barrels of oil 
per day this year before the iraqi invasion us imports had 
risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day we had moved in the 
wrong direction now we must act to correct that trend 
fourth the congress should this month enact a fiveyear 
program to reduce the projected debt and deficits by 500 billion 
that is by half a trillion dollars if with the congress we can 
develop a satisfactory program by the end of the month we can 
avoid the ax of sequester deep acrosstheboard cuts that 
would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic 
disruption 
i want to be able to tell the american people we have truly 
solved the deficit problem for me to do that a budget agreement 
must meet these tests 
it must include the measures ive recommended to increase 
economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign oil 
it must be fair all should contribute but the burden should 
not be excessive for any one group of programs or people 
it must address the growth of governments hidden liabilities 
it must reform the budget process and further it must be real 
i urge congress to provide a comprehensive fiveyear deficit 
reduction program to me as a complete legislative package with 
measures to assure that it can be fully enforced america is tired 
of phony deficit reduction or promisenow savelaterplans 
enough is enough it is time for a program that is credible and 
real 
finally to the extent that the deficit reduction program 
includes new revenue measures it must avoid any measure that would 
threaten economic growth or turn us back toward the days of 
punishing income tax rates that is one path we should not head 
down again

i have been pleased with recent progress although it has not 
always seemed so smooth 
but now it is time to produce 
i hope we can work out a responsible plan but with or without 
agreement from the budget summit i ask both houses of the congress 
to allow a straight upordown vote on a complete 500 billion 
deficit reduction package not later than september 28 
if the congress cannot get me a budget then americans will have 
to face a tough mandated sequester 
i am hopeful in fact i am confident the congress will do what 
it should and we in the executive branch will do our part 
in the final analysis our ability to meet our responsibilities 
abroad depends upon political will and consensus at home this is 
never easy in democracies where we govern only with the consent 
of the governed and although free people in a free society are 
bound to have their differences americans traditionally come 
together in times of adversity and challenge 
once again americans have stepped forward to share a tearful 
goodbye with their families before leaving for a strange and 
distant shore at this very moment they serve together with arabs 
europeans asians and africans in defense of principle and the 
dream of a new world order that is why they sweat and toil in the 
sand and the heat and the sun 
if they can come together under such adversity if old 
adversaries like the soviet union and the united states can work in 
common cause then surely we who are so fortunate to be in this 
great chamber democrats republicans liberals conservatives 
can come together to fulfill our responsibilities here 
thank you good night and god bless america

budget negotiators from the white house and 
congress are moving toward an agreement to pare next years federal 
deficit by 50 billion including higher premiums for betteroff 
medicare recipients participants said tuesday 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity said the two 
sides had agreed to increase taxes and fees by 25 billion next 
year and 130 billion over five years 
democrats and republicans have dramatically narrowed their 
differences over military cuts the official said they are 
discussing reducing the 303 billion defense budget by 10 billion 
to 11 billion next year and by 170 billion to 200 billion over 
five years 
there was still disagreement over how deeply domestic programs 
should be cut and whose taxes should be raised but participants 
were optimistic after a fifth day of bargaining at andrews air 
force base in maryland 10 miles outside washington 
some of those involved said a deal could be struck wednesday or 
thursday that would cut the deficit 50 billion next year and 500 
billion over five years 
in his speech to a joint session of congress tuesday night 
president bush said he was pleased with recent progress at the 
talks he called on the bargainers to send him a deficitcutting 
plan by months end saying the crisis in the persian gulf has made 
it even more urgent to help the nations economy 
americans must never again enter any crisis economic or 
military with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an 
excessive burden of federal debt the president said 
the president restated several of the demands he has been making 
for months for a budget agreement among them are tax breaks for 
oil exploration research and development and home purchases 
he also said he wanted a cut in the capital gains tax rate he 
warned that raising income tax rates is one path we should not 
head down again 
if congress does not send him a deficitcutting plan by the end 
of september he warned americans would have to face a massive 
spending cut triggered by the grammrudman balancedbudget law 
in the formal democratic response to bush house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo said democrats at the budget summit were 
working on behalf of the countrys working families 
just as we must ask wealthy nations to pay their fair share to 
deter aggression so we must ask wealthy americans to pay their 
fair share to prevent recession and reduce our debts he said 
he also said that savings could be found in the pentagons 
budget by eliminating weapons designed for war against the soviet 
union such as star wars antimissile defenses the b2 bomber and 
the mx missile weapons he called shadowboxing with the past 
im optimistic said sen wyche fowler dga one of the 
bargainers were going to try hard to finish as soon as we can 
im on the positive side of the mood swing white house 
chief of staff john sununu told reporters at the white house 
until tuesday afternoon the mood had been decidedly downbeat 
one of the major problems unresolved by the bargainers was how 
much money should be cut from domestic programs the range under 
discussion was 90 billion to 130 billion with democrats at the 
lower end and republicans favoring steeper cuts 
those programs include benefit programs such as medicare and 
general government efforts such as road and bridge building 
anticrime measures and environmental efforts 
also still in dispute is which taxes will be increased 
democrats have proposed increasing income tax rates for the wealthy 
and raising energy taxes while republicans are still pressing for 
a cut in the capital gains rate 
officials said that both sides are willing to accept an increase 
in the payments the betteroff elderly make for the medicare 
programs coverage of their doctors bills 
it would be the first time that monthly medicare premiums were 
set according to the income level of the recipient currently 
everyone pays 2860 per month 
a number of plans have been proposed the officials said under 
one individuals at the top of the scale earning 40000 annually 
and couples making 51200 per year would pay monthly premiums of 
close to 115 
the plan could run into considerable opposition however 
officials noted that it was likely to stir up the same opposition 
that led to the defeat last year of a proposal increasing medicare 
coverage for serious diseases and boosting the premium to pay for 
it 
if adopted the boost in medicare premiums could raise as much 
as 6 billion next year and up to 30 billion over five years one 
official said 
democrats are still proposing a 4 percent sales tax on energy 
and a separate 7centpergallon increase in the federal gasoline 
tax the combined effect of the two would be to raise the federal 
gasoline levy by 11 cents per gallon the current rate is 9 cents 
per gallon 
democrats have dropped their insistence that the top income tax 
rate on the wealthiest taxpayers be increased from 28 percent to 35 
percent one official said but the democrats are continuing to 
press for a 10 percent surcharge on the income taxes of americans 
earning more than 500000 annually 
the two sides have agreed to extend some minor taxes that would 
otherwise expire such as the 3 percent tax on telephone calls 
they are also ready to agree to increase taxes on alcoholic 
beverages and on luxury items such as expensive automobiles 
although the negotiators are close to agreeing on a defense 
budget figure no decision has been made on whether to count the 
costs of us military operations in the middle east 
with many of the bargainers sensing that an agreement could be 
near they have planned to resume their talks wednesday at andrews 
according to one official they plan to return to the capitol in 
the evening for some votes the official said that house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo who is chairman of the talks has 
said that the bargainers should then return to andrews and plan to 
work for as long as it takes to reach a deal 
the new fiscal year begins oct 1 unless a deficitcutting 
package is in place by then the grammrudman law will impose 100 
billion in cuts on the 12 trillion federal budget reductions of 
that degree would stagger most federal programs within weeks 
officials agree 
before the talks at andrews began congressional leaders had 
said they had to strike a deal by this past monday to be able to 
move the legislation through congress in time for the new fiscal 
year without action next years shortfall could exceed 250 
billion the highest amount ever

trusting and much weaker neighbor kuwait within three days

gen augusto pinochet marking the 17th 
anniversary of the coup he led in 1973 said tuesday he would stage 
another takeover again if confronted with similar circumstances 
should the circumstances of 1973 repeat i would act in the 
same manner the 74yearold army commander and former president 
said 
my only goal then was to rescue chile from a marxist 
government that was working to disintegrate the country he told 
a group of rightwing politicians 
meanwhile police said three people were injured one of whom 
was shot in the arm and 48 arrested in scattered clashes 
throughout the city linked to the anniversary 
most of the incidents occurred when rival groups celebrating or 
denouncing the anniversary clashed in the streets police used 
water cannon to disperse people and the government said calm had 
been restored by midafternoon 
police said they were investigating the wounding of a 
21yearold man who was shot as he left santiagos main cemetery 
after visiting the tomb of salvador allende the man pinochet 
toppled in the coup 
pinochet spoke briefly to the leaders of the independent 
democratic union a rightist group who visited him at his home to 
thank him for the 1973 coup that ousted allende a marxist who 
was elected president by the chilean populace 
pinochet led the armed forces in the coup which took place 
during a time of deep social political and economic crisis 
pinochet stayed in power for 16 years until march 11 when he 
was succeeded by president patricio aylwin an elected civilian 
after relinquishing the presidency to aylwin pinochet remained 
commander in chief of the army sheltered by a special clause in 
the 1980 constitution written by his government that prevents 
aylwin from firing him 
the coup anniversary was marked by the military with a series of 
private ceremonies at barracks throughout the country 
the civilian government ignored the celebrations but ministers 
and officials attended a catholic mass at the presidential palace 
for the hundreds of people who died in the coup and in the severe 
repression that followed it 
among those who died was allende who was killed the day of the 
coup as his presidential palace in downtown santiago came under 
heavy ground and air attack 
leftist politicians and relatives of the victims visited 
cemeteries to pay tribute to the dead 
hundreds paraded in front of the new marble mausoleum where 
allendes remains were reburied one week ago at santiagos main 
cemetery they were led by allendes widow hortensia bussi his 
daughters and other relatives and aides of his government 
in santiago police used water cannons to scatter small groups 
of demonstrators both celebrating and denouncing the coup 
anniversary twelve people were briefly detained according to 
deputy interior minister belisario velasco 
also in santiago two bombs went off during the night police 
said causing no victims but damaging a bank and the office of a 
right wing party no victims were reported 
several hundred people gathered early in the morning in front of 
pinochets house in a fashionable santiago neighborhood to cheer 
the former president as he left for a ceremony and mass at the 
military academy 
many of the demonstrators later marched through the providencia 
district streets chanting slogans against the aylwin government 
they also chanted pinochet will come back pinochet will come 
back

a boeing 727 jet carrying 18 
people apparently crashed southeast of newfoundland on tuesday 
after straying off course over the atlantic ocean officials said 
the faucett airliner was en route from the mediterranean island 
of malta to miami with a refueling stop scheduled for gander 
newfoundland said an airline operations manager in miami 
faucett officials said the 18 on board were all from peru where 
the airline is based but that one of the crewmen lived in miami 
transport canada spokesman lily abbass said the jet was off 
course and was believed to have gone down tuesday afternoon about 
250 miles southeast of st johns she said the crew declared a 
lowfuel emergency 30 minutes after it was due in gander she said 
the message was relayed by two us aircraft 
a spokesman for the search and rescue coordination center in 
halifax said tuesday night that a weak signal from the jets 
emergency transmitter was picked up by satellite after radio 
contact was lost 
however rescue officials said each time the satellite made a 
pass over the area the signal seemed to come from a different 
location sometimes hundreds of miles apart 
rescue officials assumed the jet ditched in the sea and 
dispatched three aurora airplanes and three labrador helicopters to 
the area where the plane was last heard from weather conditions 
were described as good and the seas calm 
some of the planes arrived in the area tuesday evening but 
spotted nothing two coast guard vessels two fisheries patrol 
vessels and two destroyers were also dispatched to the search area 
the boeing 727 no longer in production was designed to 
withstand a landing at sea and can float for several hours boeing

the state department issued an urgent appeal 
tuesday night through the voice of america to american women and 
children and arabborn male american citizens in kuwait asking 
them to get in touch with the embassy there immediately 
women and children seeking to depart the country must contact 
the us embassy without delay if they wish to be assured 
departure the appeal said 
iraqi authorities are continuing to permit american women and 
dependent children to leave the country additional evacuation 
flights are being arranged but we cannot guarantee how long these 
flights can continue 
adult male american citizens born in kuwait iraq or any other 
arab country should also get in touch with the embassy immediately 
as it is our understanding that they may be eligible for 
departure said the statement 
but adult male us citizens born in the united states remain 
subject to detention and arrest and iraq will not repeat not 
permit them to leave the department said 
in addition to the voice of america the bbc british 
broadcasting corp also was carrying the appeal to americans the 
department said 
earlier in the day the department announced that arabborn 
males would be allowed to leave 
until now the iraqis generally had not allowed american males 
to leave restricting departures to us women and children 
state department spokesman richard boucher said he had no 
estimate on the number of american males who will be eligible to 
leave under the new rules there are an estimated 1700 americans 
in kuwait and 100 in iraq 
asked why the iraqis were drawing distinctions between americans 
born in the united states and arabborn american males boucher 
noted that men from arab countries have been allowed to depart iraq 
and kuwait since the invasion began 
this new rule is maybe in their interpretation somehow 
consistent with that he said 
additional evacuation flights carrying americans from the two 
countries are planned for wednesday and friday about 160 american 
women and children arrived in baltimore on monday raising the 
total since the evacuations began to an estimated 600 
boucher said voice of america broadcasts to iraq and kuwait are 
alerting americans there to the new procedures 
us citizens male born in the united states remain subject 
to detention and arrest and iraq will not permit them to depart 
the country boucher said quoting from the voa broadcast 
he added that just under 90 american males remain in iraqi 
custody one was released to the custody of the us embassy in 
baghdad on monday he said

women in the armed forces appear almost four 
times as likely as men to be subjected to sexual harassment the 
pentagon reported tuesday 
according to a survey of 38000 military men and women the most 
common form of harassment was teasing or suggestive remarks but 15 
percent of the women and 2 percent of the men said they had been 
pressured for sexual favors 
five percent of the females and 1 percent of the male 
respondents reported actual or attempted rape or sexual assault 
said the pentagons summary of findings 
the survey was ordered in 1988 by thensecretary frank carlucci 
in response to a recommendation from a task force set up to advise 
the defense department on women in the military 
survey respondents in the four armed services and the coast 
guard were queried between december 1988 and april 1989 about 60 
percent of those contacted returned replies 
there was virtually no difference between female and male 
response rates but actual numbers were not given the proportion 
of women varies from service to service but they are about 11 
percent of todays 2 million people in the armed services 
overall the pentagon said 22 percent of active duty personnel 
indicated they had experienced some form of sexual harassment 
ranging from sexual jokes to actual assault while at work the 
previous year 
christopher jehn assistant secretary for force management and 
personnel said the department was concerned about the incidents 
reported and was carefully reviewing the findings 
jehn said in a statement he was heartened by evidence in the 
study that most of those who had been harassed also believed that 
we are moving in good faith to do something about it 
the survey first to consider active duty personnel only will 
provide a statistical benchmark for use in evaluating the 
effectiveness of policies designed to prevent sexual harassment 
the survey found that 64 percent of the women but only 17 
percent of the men had experienced some form of sexual harassment 
on the job in the previous year 
other findings 
eightytwo percent of those women victims and 74 percent of 
their men counterparts said the harassment took the form of sexual 
teasing jokes remarks or questions 
sixtynine percent of the female victims and 54 percent of the 
male victims said it took the form of suggestive looks gestures or 
body language 
sixty percent of the women victims and 51 percent of the men 
victims reported touching leaving over cornering pinching or 
being brushed against in a deliberately sexual manner 
the study said perpetrators of the experiences described by 
females were men acting alone 75 percent of the time while 22 
percent of the incidents were brought on by more than one man 
incidents started by women were not mentioned 
among men victims 50 percent of the perpetrators were women 
acting alone and only 10 percent involved a group of women but the 
other 40 percent of the incidents directed against men were caused 
by men alone or in a group with other men and women 
the study said nearly threequarters of the respondents said 
policies had been established at their posts to reduce sexual 
harassment about a quarter of the personnel either did not know of 
any such policies and believed that none had been put in place

president bush prodded congress on tuesday to 
move swiftly on measures to increase energy production including 
opening the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska to oil 
exploration 
bush in comments prompted by the persian gulf crisis called on 
congress to enact his proposals by the end of the month 
in his televised address to a joint session of congress the 
president noted that the countrys foreign oil imports have 
increased since the oil embargo of 1973 
imports were 6 million barrels a day before that and he said 
this year before the iraqi invasion of kuwait us imports 
had risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day we had moved in the 
wrong direction nowe we must act to correct that trend 
bush put congress on notice that he will be reviving the alaska 
drilling proposal a proposal that has been dormant since last 
years alaska tanker spill off valdez 
the issue is sensitive for environmentalists who say the oil 
companies should be forced to keep their hands off the pristine 
refuge on the north coast of alaska 
bush said congress should enact his proposals for increasing 
incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration encouraging 
conversion from oil to natural gas and accelerating the development 
of alaskan energy resources without damage to wildlife 
bush has long supported oil exploration in the wildlife reserve 
but congress must approve 
his proposals on socalled fuel switching are embodied in clean 
air act revisions currently being worked over in a conference of 
the house and senate 
on incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration bushs 1991 
budget contains several proposals including temporary tax credits 
for exploratory drilling expenditures and for new oil recovery 
projects and more favorable deductions for drilling costs of 
independent producers 
bush did not mention that he has blocked new exploration in 
promising areas off the california coast and administration 
officials have said he has no intention of changing his mind on 
that issue

cracks appeared tuesday in the un trade embargo against iraq 
as saddam hussein sought to circumvent the economic noose around 
his country 
japan meanwhile announced it would increase its aid to 
countries hardest hit by enforcing the sanctions hoping to defuse 
criticism that it is not doing its share to oppose baghdad japan 
said up to 2 billion in aid may be sent to nations most affected 
by the un embargo on iraq 
president bush on tuesday night promised a joint session of 
congress and a nationwide radio and television audience that 
saddam hussein will fail to make his conquest of kuwait 
permanent 
america must stand up to aggression and we will said bush 
who added that the us military may remain in the saudi arabian 
desert indefinitely 
i cannot predict just how long it will take to convince iraq 
to withdraw from kuwait bush said 
more than 150000 us troops have been sent to the persian gulf 
region to deter a possible iraqi invasion of saudi arabia 
bushs aides said the president would follow his address to 
congress with a televised message for the iraqi people declaring 
the world is united against their governments invasion of kuwait 
saddam had offered bush time on iraqi tv 
the philippines and namibia the first of the developing nations 
to respond to an offer monday by saddam of free oil in exchange 
for sending their own tankers to get it said no to the iraqi 
leader 
saddams offer was seen as a nonetoosubtle attempt to bypass 
the un embargo in effect since four days after iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait by getting poor countries to dock their tankers 
in iraq 
but according to a state department survey cuba and romania 
have struck oil deals with iraq and companies elsewhere are trying 
to continue trade with baghdad all in defiance of un sanctions 
romania denies the allegation 
the report made available to the associated press said some 
eastern european countries also are trying to maintain their 
military sales to iraq 
a wellinformed source in tehran told the associated press that 
iran has agreed to an iraqi request to exchange food and medicine 
for up to 200000 barrels of refined oil a day and cash payments 
there was no official comment from tehran or baghdad on the 
reported foodforoil deal 
but the source who requested anonymity said the deal was 
struck during iraqi foreign minister tariq azizs visit sunday to 
tehran the first by a senior iraqi official since the 198088 gulf 
war after the visit the two countries announced they would resume 
diplomatic relations 
wellinformed oil industry sources in the region contacted by 
the ap said that although iran is a major oil exporter itself it 
currently has to import about 150000 barrels of refined oil a day 
for domestic use because of damages to refineries in the gulf war 
along similar lines abc news reported that following azizs 
visit iraq is apparently prepared to give iran all the oil it 
wants to make up for the damage iraq inflicted on iran during their 
conflict 
secretary of state james a baker iii meanwhile met in moscow 
with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze two days after 
the ussoviet summit that produced a joint demand that iraq 
withdraw from kuwait 
during the summit bush encouraged mikhail gorbachev to withdraw 
190 soviet military specialists from iraq where they remain to 
fulfill contracts shevardnadze told the soviet parliament tuesday 
the specialists had not reneged on those contracts for fear it 
would jeopardize the 5800 soviet citizens in iraq 
in his speech bush said his heart went out to the families of 
the hundreds of americans held hostage by iraq but he declared 
our policy cannot change and it will not change america and the 
world will not be blackmailed 
the president added vital issues of principle are at stake 
saddam hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face 
of the earth 
in other developments 
a us diplomat in baghdad said tuesday up to 800 americans and 
britons will fly out of iraqioccupied kuwait this week most of 
them women and children leaving their husbands behind saddam has 
said he is keeping foreign men as human shields against attack 
on monday a planeload of 164 westerners arrived in baltimore 
from iraq evacuees spoke of food shortages in kuwait nighttime 
gunfire and iraqi roundups of young people suspected of involvement 
in the resistance 
there is no law and order said thuraya 19 who would not 
give her last name a soldier can rape a fathers daughter in 
front of him and he cant do anything about it 
the state department said iraq had told us officials that 
american males residing in iraq and kuwait who were born in arab 
countries will be allowed to leave iraq generally has not let 
american males leave it was not known how many men the iraqi move 
could affect 
a pentagon spokesman said some increase in military 
activity had been detected inside iraq near its borders with 
turkey and syria he said there was little indication hostilities 
are imminent 
defense secretary dick cheney said the cost of the us military 
buildup in the middle east was rising above the 1 billionamonth 
estimate generally used by government officials he said the total 
cost if no shooting war breaks out could total 15 billion in 
the next fiscal year beginning oct 1 
cheney promised disgruntled lawmakers a significant increase 
in help from arab nations and other us allies for operation 
desert shield 
japan which has been accused of responding too slowly to the 
crisis in the gulf said tuesday it may give 2 billion to egypt 
jordan and turkey hit hardest by the un prohibition on trade 
with iraq 
the pressure from abroad is getting so strong said hiroyasu 
horio an official with the ministry of international trade and 
industry 
local news reports said the aid would be extended through the 
world bank and international monetary fund and 600 million would 
be sent as early as midseptember 
on friday treasury secretary nicholas brady visited tokyo on a 
world tour seeking 105 billion to help egypt jordan and turkey 
japan has already promised a 1 billion aid package for 
multinational peacekeeping forces in saudi arabia including food 
water vehicles and prefabricated housing for nonmilitary uses 
but critics in the united states have said japan should do more 
because its economy depends heavily on oil from the middle east 
japan imports 99 percent of its oil 
japans constitution bans the use of force in settling 
international disputes and japanese law restricts the military to 
japanese territory except for ceremonial occasions 
on monday saddam offered developing nations free oil if they 
would send their tankers to pick it up 
the first two countries to respond tuesday the philippines and 
namibia said no manila said it had already fulfilled its oil 
requirements and namibia said it would not sell its 
sovereignty for iraqi oil 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez dismissed saddams 
offer of free oil as a propaganda ploy venezuela an opec 
member has led a drive among oilproducing nations to boost 
production to make up for the shortfall caused by the loss of iraqi 
and kuwaiti oil from the world market 
their oil makes up 20 percent of the worlds oil reserves only 
saudi arabia has higher reserves 
but according to the state department cuba which faces an oil 
deficit because of reduced soviet deliveries has received a 
shipment of iraqi petroleum since un sanctions were imposed five 
weeks ago and romania it said expects to receive oil indirectly 
from iraq 
romanias ambassador to the united states virgil 
constantinescu denied that claim tuesday calling it absolutely 
false and without foundation

the humiliating removal from power of 
kuwaits royal family has raised questions about how long other 
longtime rulers can survive in desert kingdoms carved out by the 
swords of their bedouin ancestors 
the iraqi takeover of kuwait five weeks ago showed the weakness 
of its emir and by extension of the other five conservative 
dynasties running the regions oilproducing states 
middle east observers say the winds of political change were 
already blowing and that iraqs seizure of kuwait has set in motion 
forces that will spell the end of the old order one way or 
another 
even the manner in which saudi arabia and other monarchies 
appealed for help as iraqi president saddam hussein gobbled up 
kuwait underlined their inherent weakness

sonia johnsons life took a dramatic 
turn after she was excommunicated from the mormon church a decade 
ago for actively supporting the proposed equal rights amendment 
devastated at first the onetime devout mormon became a lesbian 
and feminist activist giving lectures and writing now shes 
setting out to change the world 
i think of what my mother said if you want something done 
right do it yourself johnson says why dont we just do it 
were going to try to figure out how we would make a world how 
would we make a society 
the we is a handful of lesbians planning an experimental 
community based on a simple philosophy that johnson is sure will be 
misunderstood everyone does what she wants to do all the time 
we have to trust that our desires are wholesome and good and 
that our feelings reflect those desires she says we want to 
make a world based on womens values and were adamant in only 
doing what we want to do 
im 54 and for the rest of my life im going to do what i want 
to do 
johnson envisions a society based on peace love harmony joy 
and laughter and work 
the underlying theory is that women will want to work if their 
duties are in harmony with their values and that theyll even 
delight in doing it because it will suit them 
the plan for a new society is johnsons latest endeavor since 
the church of jesus christ of latterday saints excommunicated her 
in 1979 for opposing church authority by actively working for the 
era 
distraught at first johnson says now that the ouster followed 
shortly by a painful divorce led her to a fulfilling career as a 
speaker and author 
it was a great boon that the mormons gave me this new 
profession says johnson a former university professor with a 
doctorate in english education they excommunicated me to shut me 
up and really they just gave me a forum women dont get that much 
poetic justice so i just revel in it 
johnson ran for president in 1984 on both the citizens party and 
the peace and freedom party tickets finishing with 71947 votes 
two years earlier she received 40 percent of the vote in a 
secondplace finish in the race for president of the national 
organization for women 
today johnson sees now as a white middleclass professional 
organization that tries to get women into the mainstream of the 
country 
i dont want mainstream she says i want to make another 
stream 
women have been trying to get men to change the world saying 
theyve got to do right by us she says activism in the 
womens movement has been to try to get men to change things but 
this is the way men do worlds they know the problems but on the 
whole they think the world is pretty amazing were asking the 
wrong people to change things 
johnson and her group of six or seven women are looking for a 
site for their community 
she is sure they can successfully divvy up duties depending only 
on what they want to do some will want to grow vegetables she 
says others might want to build or cook or paint or clean or 
landscape or fix a leaky faucet 
johnson envisions other communities based on the same 
philosophy hers would focus on gay women because thats where her 
interests lie but she sees other minienvironments comprised of 
heterosexuals or gay men 
the communities could interact for example by providing 
vegetables to those whose residents didnt want to grow crops or by 
doing carpentry for those whose dwellers lacked either the skill or 
the desire 
her theory leaves room for jobs no one would want to do how 
many people for instance really want to clean toilets 
suppose johnson says that each of the women in the community 
checks out her feelings and finds that nope cleaning toilets 
doesnt fit in 
but because these women believe that their desires are perfect 
guides to behavior none of them says its got to be done 
she wrote last spring in woman of power magazine trusting their 
feelings and knowing that they spring directly from their values 
they realize that since none of them wants to clean it something 
is wrong with the toilet not with them 
for one thing toilets are too high for most women johnson 
says and they waste countless gallons of water a toilet also 
takes marvelous scientifically unreproducible organic matter 
and carts it off she says 
the women thus could decide to replace the conventional toilet 
with custommade composting toilets she says 
johnson feels hundreds of thousands of people across the country 
are potential members for new communities like the one she 
envisions 
one thing i absolutely know for sure is that this doesnt 
work what were doing now she says

eastern europes tilt toward the west and 
japans economic ascent in the east appear to be nudging americans 
out of a longstanding apathy toward foreign languages 
theres definitely a boom going on in language studies in this 
country said charles stansfield of the center for applied 
linguistics in washington the number and percentage of people 
studying are as high as theyve ever been 
about a third of us high school students are taking a foreign 
language class this fall stansfield estimated reflecting a steady 
rise since the 1970s when the figure was as low as 23 percent 
college students and adults also appear to be more immersed in 
language studies educators say although recent comprehensive 
statistics are not available in those categories 
educators however wonder how long foreign languages will 
remain a la mode 
the united states is solidly entrenched as the most monolingual 
of all developed countries language training professionals use 
such words as abysmal and shameful to describe americans 
foreignlanguage skills 
the explosive growth of english in eastern europe and its 
acknowledged status as the regions no 2 tongue could give 
americans even more of an excuse to stick with english 
but developments of the past few years show foreign language 
studies on the upswing in the united states 
for the first time since the mid1970s more than a million 
college students were studying foreign languages in 1986 the 
latest year for which nationwide statistics are available 
japanese chinese russian and since the fall of the berlin wall 
german all have gained experts say 
consider 
thirty states have either begun or increased foreign language 
requirements for their public schools in the last 10 years said 
jamie draper acting director of the joint national committee for 
languages in washington 
in at least five states connecticut louisiana new york 
north carolina and virginia half of all elementary and secondary 
school students are now studying a foreign language according to 
the american council on the teaching of foreign languages no state 
could make such a claim a decade ago and the council said arizona 
and california will join the group soon 
japanese language enrollment tripled the past four to five 
years to more than 30000 said richard lambert director of the 
national foreign language center at johns hopkins university more 
than 300 us schools now have programs in japanese compared with 
only a few a decade ago 
michigan recently required that all high schools offer courses 
in japanese and under a new pilot program children in a handful 
of communities mostly in california hawaii and new york are 
taught japanese beginning in first grade 
german which gradually declined in popularity in the 1980s 
has led a resurgence of some eastern european languages in the 
months since the berlin wall and the iron curtain were yanked down 
in the last year enrollment is up 52 percent for german and 44 
percent for russian at new yorkbased berlitz international inc 
the largest private language school in the country across 
manhattan the world trade institute language center says german 
enrollment is up 30 percent to 40 percent neither company would 
release enrollment figures 
people feel that in the long run these languages will help 
their careers said anthony tedesco north american vice 
president for berlitz 
interest in russian has soared since mikhail gorbachev opened 
up the soviet union through his policies of glasnost 
enrollment in undergraduate russian classes has risen 40 percent 
the last three years at the university of california at los 
angeles center for russian and east european studies considered a 
gauge of collegiate interest nationwide in those languages 
chinese was the second fastestgrowing foreign language behind 
japanese in secondary schools from 1983 through 1986 the last 
period for which statistics were compiled by the modern language 
association it grew 28 percent during that span to 3400 students 
and continues to surge experts say 
you cant ignore a language spoken by onefifth of the human 
population and consider yourself to be part of the world said 
norman colb schools superintendent in mamaroneck ny the new 
york city suburb has one of 40 us schools with a grant to teach 
chinese 
spanish remains the most widely taught foreign language at the 
college level followed by french which it surpassed in 1970 then 
come german italian russian latin and japanese 
now were constantly bombarded with other languages because of 
satellites cable tv and increased foreign travel said 
stansfield of the washington linguistics center we can no longer 
demand that our international business be done in english 
the percentage of high school students studying foreign 
languages is now just below the alltime peak year of 1934 when 
more than a third of secondary students were in language courses 
but other developed countries require more of their students 
the japanese have made a great effort to learn english 
requiring it be taught from elementary school on stansfield said 
foreign language study is mandatory in continental europe starting 
in seventh grade secondary school requirements in britain also are 
tougher than in the united states 
skepticism remains among educators and language professionals 
whether the us boom will continue without tougher university 
requirements and a government push even with the surge in 
interest a gallup poll taken last year showed that 71 percent of 
504 colleges and universities surveyed still did not require 
foreignlanguage and literature courses 
but business demands are perhaps the biggest key 
people have got to be shown that theres a place to use it 
said lambert of the national foreign language center if we can 
establish that theres more need for foreign languages in the 
business world and elsewhere then well be seeing an upward trend 
for a long time

riccardo chailly once one of europes most 
promising young conductors feels that hes entered maturity now 
that hes become director of the royal concertgebouw orchestra of 
amsterdam 
previously he and simon rattle were the wunderkind conductors 
of europe 
i was always the youngest the 37yearold conductor said 
now is the time to stop it i started conducting at the age of 
14 at whatever i was doing i was only facing older people now is 
really the time when im not any more the youngest 
chailly pronounced shyyee was 35 when he became the 
concertgebouws fifth music director his predecessors had all been 
younger when they started 
the royal concertgebouw recognized as one of the best 
orchestras in the world will tour in the united states sept 
17oct 7 its first tour in five years chailly will conduct 
the concertgebouw celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1988 and 
the title royal was bestowed also that year chailly became music 
director the first who isnt dutch he was born in milan the son 
of italian composer luciano chailly 
the name chailly is french the ancestor who left france 
chailly says was a commissioner for napoleon the name was de 
chailly until world war ii when the conductors father dropped 
de which indicated french aristocracy 
the royal concertgebouw does have a dutch sound its own 
identity of sound clarity lightness a wide range and 
capacity without ever running into the danger to be bombastic a 
superficial way of playing is completely hated by the orchestra 
chailly said 
it is so easy to be proud to sleep on your own glory they 
also are very aware of that we are daily devoting ourselves to 
protecting that sound 
the netherlands woodwinds are a very special color light 
brilliant transparent but never thin the first flutist he 
says plays a wooden flute 
chailly speaks english to the orchestra i studied dutch one 
month in italy with great effort its a very difficult language in 
terms of grammar and diction thank god in holland by the first 
year of school they learn english i feel at home talking english 
chailly conducted in england for 10 years and was principal 
guest conductor of the london philharmonic from 198386 
he conducted for the first time in amsterdam in 1985 and didnt 
know that bernard haitink music director since 1961 was going to 
retire i did my debut with great excitement it was my first 
time ever in front of such an orchestra sometimes its the best 
way not to know and just go and do your music 
when chailly graduated from music conservatory in italy at the 
age of 19 claudio abbado named him assistant conductor at la scala 
for two years he had studied conducting and composing but says he 
was horrible at composing the study helped him in interpreting 
music 
in summer breaks he played drums in a jazz band in northern 
italy he found that valuable for conducting too it helped me 
develop a clear and determined sense of rhythm and playing 
percussion gave me a sense of the independent use of my hands he 
beats time with his right hand and indicates expression with his 
left 
his conducting debut was in padua at 14 in a concert for young 
people through his teen years he conducted mozart bach and 
vivaldi in chamber music concerts in small italian cities 
chailly headed the berlin radio orchestra from 1982 to 89 but 
his major international debut was at the chicago lyric opera in 
1974 when he was 21 conducting madama butterfly 
that came about through a happenstance that wouldnt be believed 
if it was put in a movie 
the year before in sienna italy chailly ran into bruno 
bartoletti artistic director of the chicago lyric when he dropped 
into a bar on his way to conduct the final piece at a summertime 
concert he impulsively invited bartoletti to attend bartoletti 
couldnt he was on his way to dinner but he did go to the concert 
late just as chailly walked on stage impressed with what he 
heard he brought the young man to chicago 
chailly and the concertgebouw have five new recordings this year 
on london records his most recent opera recording with the 
bologna opera orchestra and chorus is rigoletto starring leo 
nucci luciano pavarotti and june anderson 
chailly doesnt guest conduct except in berlin before i was 
a little bit of a wild horse i liked very much traveling from 
1976 to 85 i came to the us every season to do opera and 
symphony i used to work every six months in england now i havent 
been there since six or seven years 
ive got two chief conducting posts the wild horse time of 
the past is over

americans often exhibit a basic instinct about 
financial cycles especially the down side of them showing by 
their behavior that they sense trouble before it descends on the 
economy in general 
they are you might say at the very front line of the economic 
battle for survival and out there in the foxholes they pick up the 
little hints and signals of rising prices job insecurity credit 
strains and the like 
their test is a practical one if the money in the wallet 
doesnt go as far as it used to then inflation is creeping higher 
if their neighbors work week is reduced to four days they think 
about recession and their own job security 
presented with such evidence consumers in the past consumed 
less read price tags that might have been ignored earlier paid 
down credit lines postponed vacations decided to use the old car 
just one more year 
some evidence of hunkering down had begun to appear in the 
economic statistics over the past few months including an 
improving savings rate but then came a report that at first 
glance seems to blow away the thesis 
that report consumer debt grew during july at an annual rate of 
74 percent the fastest in nine months and most of that 
increase was in revolving credit which includes the use of bank 
and other credit cards 
it provokes the question has their instinctive intelligence 
about such matters deserted the consumer or is the growth in the 
use of credit card debt an indication that todays consumer is 
forced to the wall 
once not long ago it was impossible for consumers to obtain 
credit that would permit them to spend in defiance of a downturn 
it was a mechanical matter that is no bank would give them credit 
with which to spend 
over the past decade that situation has changed totally almost 
no consumer needs to fill out a loan application one of those 
oldfashioned questionnaires that asked how much you made how much 
you owed what the money was needed for 
instead they have a prearranged line of credit with the 
lender who quickly delivers the money and agrees not to ask any 
embarrassing questions such as whether the borrower is employed or 
whether he intends to repay 
the oddity of this is that while lenders have created an 
easycredit society for consumers they and their federal 
regulators have progressively cracked down on loans for healthy 
business enterprises 
a crackdown on production small as it might be eventually 
leads to an imbalance of supply and demand but coupled with a 
simultaneous spur to consumption through easy credit it 
conceivably could create serious problems 
the statistical evidence leaves unresolved the reason why 
consumer credit grew so much in july 
it might just be additional evidence of strains on the consumer 
wallet as the economy slows which is bad enough but it could be 
something else too 
it could be an indication that a lot of american families are 
heading into a deeper hole than if they didnt have the easy use of 
credit heading into a situation from which it wont be easy to 
recover

this years seniors at fort zumwalt high 
schools will be armed with more than just diplomas when they 
graduate theyll also each be backed by a threeyear warranty 
in a small but growing number of schools educators are adding 
an extra stamp of approval to their products satisfaction 
guaranteed 
the diploma used to be the guarantee said fort zumwalt 
superintendent bernard dubray but now we need to go above and 
beyond 
warranties such as fort zumwalts typically guarantee that a 
graduate has learned the basic skills necessary to perform an 
entrylevel job if not the school promises to provide additional 
training free of charge 
its accountability said bernard sidman superintendent of 
the plymouthcarver regional school district in massachusetts 
which first included a threeyear warranty with graduates diplomas 
last spring and so far has had no students sent back 
you hear an awful lot about the quality of public education 
and about public institutions of education not meeting their 
responsibilities in preparing students for entry into public 
life sidman said 
we felt that if we were going to be asking the community to 
support us maybe we should put ourselves on the line 
but let the buyer beware the amount of training received by 
guaranteed graduates may vary some schools simply warranty all 
their graduates in others the warranty program is designed mainly 
for students who want jobs straight out of high school 
at prince georges county school district in maryland students 
who want to be under warranty take a semester class focusing on job 
skills the class has been developed with input from area business 
and industry leaders 
in missouris blue springs school district the states largest 
the graduate guarantee is printed on the back of a laminated 
walletsize diploma 
weve got some tremendous young people coming out of our 
system said superintendent charles mcgraw the nations 
educational system is getting a bad rap and we wanted to make a 
point that our graduates had the skills to be good employees 
but its not enough just to warranty students if theres no 
recognition of what entrylevel jobs in todays business world 
require said fritz edelstein senior fellow at the national 
alliance for business in washington dc 
entrylevel jobs are much more complex today and school studies 
should reflect that edelstein said 
mcgraw agreed 
i think we went through a time when the curriculum was out of 
date he said the curriculum has been slow changing it 
hasnt kept up with the progress of technology that the business 
world required so this is an attempt to be up to date 
for instance mcgraw said mechanical drawing is out 
computerassisted drafting is in at the junior high level a new 
exploratory course called industrial technology is being offered to 
introduce students to robotics broadcasting electronics and 
computer science he said 
educators say skill guarantees have helped create a line of 
communication between schools and businesses 
its a feedback system said gary marx associate executive 
director of the american association of school administrators in 
arlington va its a way for the schools to say to an employer 
its all right to come back and let us know if theres something 
missing here 
in the harlem consolidated school district outside rockford 
ill this years seniors will be able to earn a certificate of 
employability 
the idea came about through meetings between school 
administrators and corporate leaders from the community assistant 
superintendent wayne musholt said 
during discussions company executives expressed concerns about 
the employability of some of the students graduating today 
particularly those who were not collegebound 
their concern was that some of the students didnt always have 
the best work habits and attitudes and we decided there ought to be 
a way of certifying them musholt said 
to gain the certificate students will have to earn the required 
number of high school credits and be absent no more than six days a 
year in addition their work attitudes will be rated by their 
teachers 
the program at prince georges county schools has received high 
marks from business and industry leaders said bonnie jenkins 
director of public affairs 
the response has been overwhelmingly positive so far she 
said 
employers prefer the students who have completed the special 
semester course which emphasizes such areas as work habits and 
attitudes reasoning and problem solving and oral communication 
skills 
so its giving them an edge she said 
last year was the first for the project and no students have 
been referred back for more training jenkins said 
guarantees rekindle employers interest in high school graduates 
and encourage potential dropouts to stay in school said thomas 
shannon executive director of the national school boards 
association in alexandria va 
this is adding a new dimension to the diploma he said 
its a gimmick its right out of madison avenue but secondly 
it also sends a powerful message to the school staff that your work 
is really on the line

at one time ray liotta would have been perfectly 
happy to just stay home 
his mother was the movie fan of the family liotta preferred 
sports he went out for the senior play in high school only after 
quitting the basketball team because of a fight with his coach 
and when liotta decided to study acting at the university of 
miami he wasnt doing it out of a compulsion to entertain or a 
need for artistic expression he simply had nothing better to do 
my parents wanted me to go to college and i didnt want to 
go said liotta who stars with robert de niro and joe pesci in 
goodfellas 
my parents then suggested i take a year off and find out what 
lifes all about i decided to go to the university of miami and 
take drama so i wouldnt have to take a math class and when i got 
there i didnt want to do anything 
but he changed not right away liotta had no great desire to 
act immediately after graduating but by 1986 when he hustled his 
way into a small but memorable role in something wild the 
actor was hungry for work 
now after dominic and eugene and field of dreams the 
offers come to him liotta didnt have to beg for the starring role 
of goodfellas he wanted the part and director martin scorsese 
wanted him even de niro put in a good word 
the movie runs more than two hours and covers four decades 
liotta is in virtually every scene 
you have to have a certain amount of confidence to be an 
actor liotta said in an interview in this film i had to show 
jealousy rage happiness anger everything was there you 
want to take that challenge as an actor it was pretty intense 
i had 80 costume changes one days in the 50s the next 
days in the 80s emotionally it was all different things one 
day im sweet then the next day im coked out of my mind wed 
span 20 years at one location 
goodfellas is based on nicholas pileggis bestselling 
novel wiseguy liotta plays henry hill a halfirish 
halfsicilian brooklyn kid drawn to the fastpaced gangster life 
who eventually hooks up with mobsters de niro and pesci 
off screen liotta had to fit in as well de niro and scorsese 
have worked many times before notably in raging bull and 
taxi driver liotta knowing this was his chance to establish 
himself as a major star did his best to treat the film like just 
another job 
these guys have made major major movies theyre considered 
geniuses and brilliant and all that i just approached it as a 
game just telling a story no big deal i read the book about five 
years ago and thought geez i could do this 
liotta began acting in soaps shortly after graduating from 
college he worked for three years on another world 
appreciating the steady work and learning how to feel comfortable 
in front of a camera but after appearing in the shortlived tv 
series casablanca and our family honor he struggled to 
find work 
having nothing to do wasnt much fun anymore when liotta 
learned there was an opening for a violent excon in something 
wild he pushed hard trying unsuccessfully to get an audition 
and finally calling on his friend melanie griffith the films 
star 
i said let me phone melanie she was already cast 
director jonathan demme was down to three guys and it was the 
final week of casting she said great idea ill do that i wish 
she had thought of that before i was just so angry about trying to 
get in and the part called for an angry guy i went in angry and 
luckily it worked out 
he played nice for dominic and eugene starring as a quiet 
medical student who takes care of his retarded brother and was a 
good guy in field of dreams appearing as the ghost of baseball 
great shoeless joe jackson 
all his characters are motivated by passion the actor says for 
goodfellas it was the drive for money and power there was his 
wife griffith in something wild his brother in dominic and 
eugene and baseball in field of dreams 
liottas own passion came during those frustrating times before 
something wild when he and fellow unemployed actors kevin 
costner and andy garcia would hang out and try to keep their 
spirits up like frustrated minor leaguers just begging for the 
manager to hand them the ball 
i didnt have any doubts about my ability liotta said i 
wasnt wondering when i was going to get a break im not being 
cocky it was tough no question about it you see these people 
and think i cant do that i can at least do it as well and 
with more commitment

chile peppers burn your fingers and can make you cry and sweat 
but still people come back for more cooks and diners over much of 
the planet are devoted to them 
the whole chile pepper book published this week is for 
those who take chiles seriously if youre among the unschooled 
thinking hot is some chiles and hotter is just some more you have 
a lot to learn 
and these historians of heat these cherishers of chiles may 
convert you 
there are of course people who treat the fiery pods as a test 
of their bravery and authors dave dewitt and nancy gerlach tell 
chileeating contest tales such as john espinosas 1988 chowdown 
of 29 jalapenos in two minutes flat 
in 1956 newsweek reported contestants in lousiana were 
required to eat progressively hotter peppers and were penalized if 
they winced shuddered or flinched according to dewitt and 
gerlach 
but the authors frown on considering chiles merely a mild danger 
you ought to encourage people to appreciate the finer 
qualities of chile peppers than only the burning sensation said 
dewitt who with gerlach a dietitian has written two previous 
cookbooks and edits the whole chile pepper magazine in albuquerque 
nm 
theyre healthy theyre addictive the more you eat of the 
spicier foods the less you want to go back to meat and mashed 
potatoes said jane butel a chef and author who owns pecos 
valley spice co in new york city a little bit can change the 
entire complexion of food 
when a diner requested some hot sauce at the fourth street grill 
in berkeley calif recently chef kurt koessel sent out crushed 
red chiles a bottled sauce from the yucatan peninsula and three 
sauces from belize 
we want to make food that wakes up your mouth food that isnt 
just incidental on the table he said we want it to interrupt 
the conversation 
to that end his menu included pineapple habanero chile salsa 
with mint and coriander poblano chiles stuffed with smoked 
chicken apples and jicama and even a cascabel chile creme brulee 
you taste the sweetness first that kind of coats your tongue 
and when that fades away the heat comes on at the end koessel 
said 
chiles have at various times in various places been used as 
currency considered an aphrodisiac and been prized as a key to 
eternal youth the authors note their use for more than three dozen 
ailments 
sometimes they say the peppers are cited as the cure and the 
cause mexicans commonly treat stomachaches by chewing and 
swallowing a serrano chile while americans often complain that 
chiles give them stomach trouble 
nutritionally theyre a bargain chiles contain few calories 
three and a half ounces of fresh chiles contain more than twice the 
recommended dietary allowance for vitamin c 
and then theres the firepower 
the heat source capsaicin has no flavor color or odor it is 
measured by highpressure liquid chromatography in scoville units 
named for a pharmacologist who came up with an early measure of 
heat 
habaneros also called scots bonnet or scotch bonnet are the 
hottest chile known measuring 200000 to 300000 scoville units 
the authors say they quote a dominican priest francisco ximenez 
as saying in 1722 that a single habanero pod would make a bull 
unable to eat 
the authors quote a 1980 science news report noting that a 
single drop of capsaicin diluted in 100000 parts of water will 
produce a persistent burning on the tongue diluted in 1 million 
parts it produces a perceptible warmth 
we are not preaching that people submerge the flavors of food 
in so much heat that they break out in a sweat and start gagging 
dewitt said it does take some getting used to 
novices might avoid for example recipes in the whole chile 
pepper book for pepperpeanut beef kabobs from nigeria which 
rate an eight on a heat scale from one to 10 the berbere paste 
from ethiopia rated at nine or the sri lankan black curry an 
eight 
most of the 180 recipes in the whole chile pepper book 
little brown and co 1695 paperback measure four to six and 
thats the range dewitt said he generally enjoys 
but the point is to eat chiles he said daily 
the only requirement of the whole chile pepper diet is 
chiles in at least one meal a day 365 days a year 
i eat chile pepper in some form every day sometimes just a 
saay i had a simple hamburger with sliced 
jalapenos on it yestelsa on eggs todrday i had some enchiladas dewitt 
said 
i have to have them every day koessel said adding that he 
finds chiles erotic and curative as well as delicious 
sometimes you get into a macho thing with them he said 
on sunday mornings at the restaurant if weve had a long night 
on saturday maybe had a little bit to drink we have oysters with 
habanero sauce you wake right up 
the authors say the earliest evidence of chiles in the human 
diet is from mexico traced to 7500 bc 
chiles which are not related to black pepper are native to 
south america and inititally were spread by birds carrying seeds 
the authors say then columbus brought seeds to europe and from 
there chiles wer 4300 4320

the drama that plays daily in criminal 
courtrooms around the country is mostly tragedy and judge earl 
strayhorn knows its characters and sad speeches well still in 
this second part of the series city faces city fears the 
jurist who grew up in the inner city says he cannot let his 
sorrow and pity cloud the tough judgments he must make 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its late morning in judge earl strayhorns 
chambers and todays topic is wasted lives one young man is dead 
in a shooting over drugs another a 19yearold gang member will 
pay for the crime 
now its bargaining time 
the 19yearolds lawyer pleads for mercy the prosecutor talks 
of murder then the judge makes his offer 20 years take it or 
leave it 
minutes later the boyish cocaine dealer jaw jutting head 
cocked back defiantly pleads guilty to murder his mother 
straining to hear in the courts front row cups her tearful face 
in her hands as she leaves shes comforted by a youth whose 
tshirt has a moniker on the back killer 
so goes another day in the cook county courts another day where 
dreams die where mothers cry where the strangest and saddest 
stories are told where a few words from the honorable earl 
strayhorn can mean life or death 
yes this is justice the judge says of the fiveminute 
bargaining session he estimates saved seven trial days hes not 
walking away with a slap on the wrist twenty years aint chopped 
liver the penitentiary is not a country club 
for almost 20 years strayhorn has judged the crimes and 
misdemeanors of urban america this tarttongued veteran of the 
nations largest court system says hes a pragmatist not a 
dreamyeyed crusader out to right every wrong 
i am not societys avenging angel he declares i am not 
sitting in order to act as the conscience of society and to impose 
the horrible wrath of the lord on people who commit horrible 
crimes 
and he has heard his share the teen who threw her baby down a 
garbage chute into a compacter the guy who axed his grandmother to 
death the man who hacked off his lovers head and toes and mailed 
them 
life in this day and age is cheaper than a piece of meat in 
the meat market strayhorn says people will haggle over the 
cost of steak more than they will consider the worth of a human 
life 
i cope with that but he adds slowly i never get used to 
it 
in fact strayhorn believes the world has turned harsher since 
he first donned black robes more vicious crimes more drug use 
younger offenders 
but this man who has climbed the steps of the depressionera 
criminal courts building for 42 of his 72 years as a prosecutor 
defense attorney and now judge decided long ago not to allow the 
cruelty eat him up 
i put a shield on i dont let it get behind that shield he 
says sitting in his chambers lined with awards memorabilia and 
photos of his wife lawyerson doctordaughter and grandchild 
strayhorn disposes of 500 to 550 cases a year about 60 percent 
in pleas or bench trials in 1989 28647 felony cases were filed 
in the countys criminal division more than triple the number of a 
decade earlier officials say an estimated 75 percent were tied to 
drugs 
strayhorn says being a black raised in chicago he now lives a 
15minute drive from work better prepared him to be a judge he 
understands the environment and experiences of many who become 
court statistics 
but when the whitehaired bespectacled judge takes the bench in 
his cavernous marble and wood courtroom hes no soft touch 
why are you wearing that junk he snaps at a bearded drug 
offender whose earring he takes as a sign of gang membership 
when you come into court you better take it out youre caught 
with them their dirt is going to spill over on you and im going 
to send you to the penitentiary do you understand 
a suspected burglar fares no better his lawyer wants his bond 
reduced arguing that he supports four children strayhorn asks how 
much he gives the mother each week and questions his claim that a 
jobs waiting the man mumbles a confused answer 
strayhorn interrupts snarling at the lawyer dont make him 
lie tell him to shut up thats why hes here hes a liar 
you cant put anything over on the guy says jack murphy a 
prosecutor hes seen it all hes heard it all 
but strayhorn has a lighter side too he teases a balding 
lawyer this case has got all the hair on it you lost off your 
head he needles another youre starting off on the short end 
of the stick this one happened in my neighborhood 
and at a civil marriage ceremony for a jail inmate strayhorn 
suddenly looks up from his paperwork and barks hey man kiss 
her 
after a generation on the bench strayhorn says punishment 
remains the toughest part of the job 
he has imposed the death penalty twice though he morally 
opposes it and once sentenced a gang rapist to 125 years 
prompting the man to retort i hope you croak in bed tonight 
but he also acknowledges he probably gives more probation than 
other judges in about 85 percent of his cases 
my probation is harder to do than doing time he argues 
you have to use some selfdiscipline thats punishment 
particularly when they know what theyve got hanging over their 
head is a big sword 
if i send this malleable kid down to the penitentiary all 
hes going to learn down there is how to be a bigger worse 
crook he adds 
when ordering probation strayhorn always tells criminals what 
their prison sentences will be if they violate it he gives no 
second chances 
im arrogant he says i have confidence in myself i feel 
im better than most and as good as the best 
still he says not a day goes by that i dont remember that i 
am black and being a judge really hasnt changed that 
it becomes a theme when he speaks to groups of young people 
when does a black person become a nigger in our society he 
says he asks such groups and their eyes widen and then somebody 
says i dont know when i say when you leave the room 
the moral of the story i know im good but im still 
black that means im not going to receive the benefit of being 
good merely because i have been good im going to have to be 
something more 
strayhorn says he knows racism and other urban ills often are 
factors in crimes that doesnt sway him 
all i can do is put a bandaid on the cancer he says if 
i allow my sorrow and my pity and my understanding that there is an 
explainable reason this person is just a step above an animal if i 
allow the feeling to outweigh my judgment im not going to be a 
good judge

drug cases have clogged urban courts delayed 
civil matters overcrowded jails and stirred new debate over the 
best possible solution legalization or more judges 
if you want to look at the largest single cause of caseload 
glut drugs are it said albert alschuler professor at the 
university of chicago law school were having fewer and fewer 
trials particularly on the civil side no one can afford to wait 
the systems just become unworkable 
much of the impact is on state courts which process about 97 
percent of drug arrests but the federal system also is feeling the 
crunch consider 
drug cases in federal courts increased by 280 percent since 
1980 chief justice william rehnquist said last december in his 
annual endoftheyear report he urged congress to act immediately 
on a proposal to create new judgeships 
in july the senate judiciary committee approved a measure to 
create 77 new judgeships the bill is pending in the senate 
federal drug cases represented more than 26 percent of new 
criminal filings and up to 60 percent in some districts rehnquist 
said nearly 55 percent of criminal appeals involved drug offenses 
compared with 30 percent in 1980 
the drug caseload rose by 56 percent in 17 bigcity courts 
between 1983 and 1987 according to a 1989 report the impact of 
drug cases on case processing in urban trial courts among the 
major increases boston 175 percent jersey city nj 114 
percent the bronx borough of new york city 109 percent and 
oakland calif 95 percent 
drugrelated cases made up about a quarter of felonies 
disposed of in 26 bigcity courts in 1987 the report said it 
noted that number actually is low because it doesnt count 
incidents in which drugs were involved but didnt constitute the 
most serious charge 
the situation has turned even grimmer since then in detroit 
the percentage of state court drug cases more than doubled from 
1987 to 1989 said john goerdt the reports coauthor and senior 
staff attorney at the national center for state courts 
drug cases he added are starting to show up in family 
courts in juvenile courts with abused and neglected kids 
when courts are stressed nobody can render the same quality 
of justice said james fyfe a criminal justice professor at 
american university in washington dc we all know the old saw 
that justice delayed is justice denied evidence disappears 
recollections grow dimmer 
complicating matters experts say are new mandatory sentencing 
laws leading some defendants to seek trial rather than pleading 
guilty adding to the backlog 
in goerdts report jury trials in the 26 bigcity courts 
disposed of only 6 percent of all felonies in 1987 
while some propose more staff us district judge robert w 
sweet in new york last year became the first federal judge to 
publicly advocate drug legalization the burden is so great he 
said that in september 1989 no federal juries in manhattan were 
available to hear civil trials 
others who have previously supported legalization include 
baltimore mayor kurt schmoke and conservative columnist william f 
buckley 
regardless of different proposals experts agree the impact is 
enormous 
the taxpayers are spending lots of money to warehouse people 
in jail alschuler said inmates are sleeping on floors on 
mattresses everybody in the system suffers

nearly 30 years ago a new volcanic island 
appeared in the north atlantic and it has been offlimits to all 
but scientists ever since ap science editor paul raeburn is one of 
the few people to visit this most recent addition to the earths 
real estate

in the early morning darkness on nov 
14 1963 a sudden turbulence rocked a fishing vessel 20 miles 
south of iceland 
when day broke the thick smell of sulfur hung over the deck 
and a towering column of smoke rose nearby the crew of the 
isleifur ii watched as a fiery undersea eruption gave birth to a 
glowing volcanic island 
that island now called surtsey is the newest place on earth 
before the lava cooled icelandic scientists decided surtsey 
should be preserved as a natural laboratory 
i foresaw this was a golden opportunity to see how life would 
settle on the island said sturla fridriksson a biologist at 
icelands agricultural research institute in reykjavik 
i went out there in the first phases of the eruption and saw 
that birds were already using that dry place the seagulls were 
apparently the first living things to set foot on the island 
for nearly 30 years now surtsey has given scientists a glimpse 
of what might have happened when life appeared on the primordial 
earth billions of years ago 
the latest studies reveal the appearance of the first true plant 
communities on the island said fridriksson who has studied 
surtsey almost from the beginning 
geologists too have an opportunity for unique research 
this is a chance for people to observe the formation of 
oceanic crust except that its above the water said kathleen 
crane of the lamontdoherty geological observatory in palisades 
ny who has spent time on surtsey we know there must be 
thousands of surtseys maybe millions on the ocean floor but we 
cant see them 
surtsey named after surtur a giant in old norse mythology who 
came from the south bearing fire has been visited by fewer than 
100 people 
access is strictly controlled by a committee of icelandic 
scientists before stepping foot on the island visitors are 
instructed to empty their pockets shoes and trouser cuffs to 
prevent accidental importation of seeds 
the island is about 90 minutes by boat from icelands westmann 
islands a volcanic archipelago off icelands southern coast boats 
cant dock on the island so visitors transfer to a small rubber 
dinghy to get to a blacksand beach littered by driftwood from as 
far away as siberia 
you may even get coconuts here said jon olafsson a chemist 
at icelands marine research institute 
further inland the black sand beach gives way to a colorful 
patchwork of red yellow orange and blue soils steam curls from 
gaping vents or fumaroles in some spots volcanic ash has 
hardened into tuff a natural concrete in other places molten 
lava has cooled into hazardous fields of jagged black rock 
razorsharp but soft enough to break off in the hand 
arni johnsen now an editor at icelands largest newspaper and a 
sometime member of parliament was recruited to move to the island 
as caretaker a few months after the eruption began 
his job was to keep intruders away and monitor scientific 
experiments in between researchers visits 
sometimes i woke up in the night falling from my bed with the 
earthquakes said johnsen who was then 20 years old but you 
get used to it the island was moving all the time like a heart 
once he was trapped in a lava flow and had no choice but to 
make a dash across the molten rock his shoes burned completely 
away i was in socks when i came off the lava icelandic thick 
wool socks he said i only burned my feet a little 
a day after the crew of the isleifur ii spotted the smoke from 
the eruption the lava had broken the oceans surface rising 425 
feet from the ocean floor in only two days 
lightning and thunder accompanied the glowing craters fissures 
and boiling water 
the atmosphere was primeval said fridriksson 
the eruption continued for four years two other smaller islands 
also were formed but quickly disappeared under the pounding of the 
waves and the wind 
the wind erosion is important said sveinn jakobsson head 
of the geology department at the icelandic museum of natural 
history this is a very stormy place 
the assault of the elements is wearing surtsey down too when 
it was formed it covered 270 hectares or about one square mile 
now it has shrunk to about threefourths of that it also has 
slumped from a height of 575 feet to about 490 feet 
it started to diminish very quickly said jakobsson then 
the rate of erosion went down during the past five years its 
something like one hectare per year 
the erosion also is changing surtseys composition geologists 
observed that certain elements including sodium potassium 
calcium aluminum and silica were leached out of the ash iron and 
titanium werent 
the process is just now resulting in the first bits of true soil 
on the island jakobsson said 
despite the erosion the island is not likely to disappear as 
quickly as its two former neighbors he said 
whats going to save surtsey is the tuff he said we are 
pretty certain this island will last for a long time probably 
several hundred years possibly several thousand years 
fridriksson made his first discovery a few months after the 
eruption began 
i went out there in the spring to see if i could find forms of 
life he said and i found seeds of sea rocket and lyme 
grass when he brought them back to his laboratory they sprouted 
that was proof they could survive the transport he said he 
determined that seeds were arriving by way of ocean currents in 
the wind and through more unorthodox means 
some for example arrived clinging to mermaids purses 
castoff egg cases of the flat fish called skates snow buntings 
brought seeds from scotland in their gizzards 
fridriksson found the first plant on surtsey a lone sea rocket 
during the first summer that was a second milestone 
its one thing to get dispersed to an island and altogether 
another thing to be a successful colonist he said 
the next milestone fridriksson searched for was the appearance 
of permanent colonists there are many that have established 
themselves as single examples and have not been able to multiply 
he said

sea sandwort appeared on the island for three or four years 
before it began producing seeds and became a permanent resident he 
said 
another milestone is just now occurring the isolated patches of 
sea sandwort are developing into plant communities 
gradually sand drifts into this mat and it forms a sand 
dune fridriksson explained seeds of lyme grass germinate in the 
sand sheltered by the sandwort 
the blackbacked seagull uses the patch for nesting it brings 
in food for the young and the excrement from the young and the 
adult bird fertilize the plant he said 
interactions like that are the culmination of nearly 30 years of 
the development of life on surtsey fridriksson said 
and he expects the island to continue to develop in wondrous 
unpredictable ways 
whenever you come to surtsey you always find something new 
something surprising which you havent expected he said its 
a revelation and it directs ones thoughts to the origin of life 
on earth and to the fate of life 
for life on surtsey eventually will disappear 
surtsey will become steeper and smaller fridriksson said 
finally it will become just a rock that will be broken up by the 
waves 
and that will be the end those who study that will be able to 
tell how a society is built up and how its destroyed

surtsey like iceland itself is a piece 
of the midatlantic ridge 
extending from greenland to antarctica the ridge is the earths 
largest geological feature it was formed when continentsized 
plates of the earths crust started to separate allowing molten 
magma to well up in between 
the ancient icelandic parliament site of thingvellir east of 
reykjavik lies astride the gap between the north american and 
eurasian plates 
you can see north america on one side and right next to you 
eurasia said kathleen crane of the lamontdoherty geological 
observatory in palisades ny who has done research on surtsey 
the two continents move an average of nearly an inch farther 
apart each year 
icelanders revel in their countrys unusual origin crane said

for the turners there could be no place to live 
but the city 
their condo has everything a harbor view a jacuzzi proximity 
to dozens of chic restaurants its a quick walk to work for john 
a venture capitalist carole sells japanese prints from the 
building their sailboat is moored outside convenient for a 
weekend ride to marblehead 
we all like city life says carole the suburbs are too 
stifling too boring here theres everything 
crime is mostly a rumor some cars have been burglarized but 
theres a guard downstairs and a neighborhood network of doormen 
and valet parkers keep watch fourteenyearold brian rides the 
subway to private school without incident his closest brush came 
when he saw a shoplifter arrested at filenes 
he was very shocked by it said his mother 
three miles and a world away the rev bruce wall takes four 
boys ages 14 to 16 to a pizza parlor in the citys 
violencescored dorchester section to hear what they have to say 
about their lives 
did they talk about basketball or girls jobs cars or their 
future no they said we know that were either going to get shot 
or stabbed and they discussed which theyd rather have happen to 
them said wall 
their choice in life was to be shot 
more than 20 years ago after riots scorched detroit newark 
los angeles and other cities the presidents national advisory 
commission on civil disorders the kerner commission issued a 
warning 
us cities it said were moving toward two societies one 
black one white separate and unequal 
after two decades of waxing and waning federal aid to the 
cities the warning seems prophetic now it is coming true 
said fred harris who as an oklahoma senator served on the kerner 
commission 
two years ago harris a university of new mexico professor 
headed a private commission that reviewed the state of the cities 
it concluded that instead of street rioting urban centers are now 
undergoing quiet riots daily encounters with poverty crime 
family dissolution housing and school deterioration 
disproportionately these riots hurt the minorities and poor of 
the city the battle lines are set along neighborhood boundaries of 
wealth and race 
again two societies 
amid the new construction of office buildings and milliondollar 
condominiums pockets of poverty are growing deeper and wider 
amid the explosion of technology schools are crumbling and 
illiteracy rates remain high 
amid the lifesaving techniques of organ transplants and laser 
surgery the life expectancy rate is dropping for those in the 
inner city 
two societies separated by income opportunity even in a 
sense by language 
william labov a university of pennsylvania linguist has made a 
study of urban dialects while the verbs and nouns sound the same 
the polarization within the city is creating two separate 
languages labov said 
labov uses the example of the word be as in she been 
married 
to most white people it means she was married to most blacks 
it means she was married and has been married a long time he 
said the machinery of language is changing and the differences 
can lead to misunderstanding 
this fragmentation of the city is most glaring in the 
oncemuscular industrial centers of the north and east which have 
seen a decline in population or only scant growth cities of the 
sun belt and the west are experiencing steady population growth 
with the exception of oil region towns like denver dallas and 
houston yet all urban centers share some of the same issues 
one major problem is the migration of the middle class both 
white and black from innercity neighborhoods to the suburbs and 
beyond 
in their wake are left poorer neighborhoods with less political 
power and fewer resources 
statistics illustrate some of this trend gary orfield a 
university of chicago political scientist said many northern 
cities have seen white populations drop by a sixth and black 
populations slip by a 20th the number of hispanics in many urban 
areas has doubled 
as a result nearly 40 percent of the nations minority students 
and 30 percent of its poor children now are educated in urban 
school districts 
while much of the nation prospered in the steady economic growth 
of the 1980s many innercity neighborhoods headed in the opposite 
direction poverty rates for the nations central cities rose from 
127 percent of the population to 19 percent 
a drive through the city can illustrate the effects of growing 
poverty 
in chicago there are neighborhoods where you can count up the 
number of bank branches and retailers that have closed up and five 
liquor stores have taken their place said greg duncan program 
director of the university of michigans survey research center 
you can clearly see neighborhoods shifting from working class 
to hardcore poverty 
harris points to detroit as another example through the 1980s 
the city lost many of its jobs and nearly a third of its population 
people black and white who could moved out to the 
suburbs he said a lot of poor blacks have moved in the 
movement of blacks and whites to the suburbs and the middle class 
has been a very good thing for them but it hasnt been that good 
for the city

but which part of the city within each city are many different 
cities the city of neighborhoods and the city of business and 
shopping districts some sparkling and rich some decaying and poor 
many downtowns have blossomed with new office towers new jobs 
and a range of stores and restaurants catering to the urban 
professional from neimanmarcus to mrs fields cookies 
the city offers more said george jedlin a boston real 
estate agent who lives in a downtown condominium ive been to 
the theater 15 times this year and i love to eat in the suburbs 
there are no restaurants 
but while many cities have seen commercial construction grow 
residential construction has remained static or fallen most of the 
deficit has been in affordable housing 
a report last year by the nonprofit center on budget and policy 
priorities said that while the number of renters with annual 
incomes less than 10000 rose from 8 million to 116 million from 
1978 to 1985 available lowrent units decreased by half a million 
chicago has had an incredible investment in the loop at the 
same time we have many dying neighborhoods said orfield the 
way things are going he warned well have people living not 
too far apart from each other but in different worlds 
orfield also notes that the downtown boom while creating jobs 
for those in the suburbs has brought little improvement for 
minority city dwellers 
chicago employment statistics show only one out of six young 
black men have a job if that is true you have a calamity said 
orfield 
many would argue there are calamities taking place each day 
calamities of drugs of gangs of violence 
one telling statistic homicide is the leading cause of death 
for black males ages 15 to 19 some might be not be surprised if 
the carnage was taking place only in detroit or washington dc 
but it is happening too in cities like boston milwaukee and st 
louis 
irving spergel a university of chicago sociologist and an 
expert on street gangs said such groups always have existed what 
is new is their longevity and firepower 
unlike before the kids dont leave the gangs as they get 
older because theres no place to go he said drug 
trafficking makes for a good opportunity and the weaponry has 
improved 
if parts of the city have become a war zone many of its 
citizens are exhibiting something akin to battle fatigue 
michael mckeon an evanston illbased pollster who has worked 
with the democratic national committee said interviews with city 
residents show a growing resignation to the problems 
to them there has become a basic irrelevance to the system 
he said the lady who lives in the highrise condo and the kid in 
the poor neighborhood have some of the same fears and frustrations 
about living in the city but theyre not angry with the 
government how can you get angry at its failure to deliver when 
you dont expect it to work in the first place 
yet through it all the people of both cities the city of the 
rich and the city of the poor remain committed to their home 
you can have a mansion in the suburbs for what you can get in 
the city said judy krupnik who lives in a onebedroom boston 
condo but in a city you feel more vibrant you feel a different 
pulse 
for pam jones a mother of two in bostons mostly black roxbury 
section it is a sense of community jones moved back to the city 
neighborhood where she was raised and intends to stay despite the 
threat of crime made real by the sound of gunfire in the night 
i like the neighborhoods here i like the people she said 
we are not thinking about leaving we are trying to do what we 
can to turn things around and make it a neighborhood that we can be 
proud of

thursday evenings are family time at the home of 
antonio and carolyn benson a time reserved to discuss schoolwork 
or chores but one thursday benson gathered his boys ages 5 8 
and 11 in the living room and reviewed what to do when they hear 
gunshots 
i told them that no matter where they were at home or in a 
car they should get down on the ground that they shouldnt be 
looking around or curious about whats happening said benson in 
the even tone of a parent telling a child to look both ways before 
crossing the street 
the sound of gunfire isnt yet that common on the quiet street 
in bostons dorchester section where benson grew up and now tries 
to raise his boys to manhood but there are other troubling sounds 
sounds of a distant storm 
like the talk about the two teenagers shot up on greenwood 
avenue last winter and closer to home talk about the bullet that 
went through a neighbors window down the street 
there are whispers about the greenwood gang a group of teens 
believed to be dealing drugs a few streets over and the junior 
greenwoods a gang of boys younger than 11yearold victor benson 
in a rush to mimic the hard ways of their older brothers 
they do bad things like robbing ladies victor explains 
with a nervous smile 
it is boys like victor and his brothers giovanni and stefon 
who are key to which side will win the inner city wars tony and 
carolyn benson envision their sons as aware young black men 
future professionals who can save their community from chaos me 
and my dad want me to be a lawyer says victor who then lists 
other goals more common for a boy his age an artist a football 
player a track star 
when i grow up i want to be a police officer giovanni pipes 
in his father winces when the 7yearold assumes a combat shooting 
stance and makes gun noises 
it is a reminder for benson a 28yearold schoolteacher that 
these days his boys are at risk as potential fodder for the drugs 
the gangs and the associated dangers of the street 
i dont have a lot of fear for myself but i am afraid that 
something could happen to one of my boys says benson im 
afraid were going to lose a lot of our kids in this generation 
the bensons do their best to keep their sons from temptation 
victor and giovanni are in a program that sends them to school in 
the affluent suburb of weston after school and on weekends they 
are kept busy with activities like junior track basketball and 
family outings 
weve got to have alternatives for them we try to keep them 
in programs says carolyn who works in the state department of 
social services i try to be with my kids know where they are 
and who their friends are 
victor turns quiet when asked about going out alone for the 
most part his time is structured but sometimes in the summer he 
rides his bicycle around the neighborhood i get a little nervous 
about going outside he says his eyes go wide when asked what 
hed do if recruited by a gang 
id run he explains patiently if you join a gang you 
have to do something bad and sometimes when you join a gang and 
you want to get out they shoot you 
each day at school where he teaches english social studies and 
reading to 11 and 12yearolds benson is reminded of the dangers 
of the city 
we have kids who come from homes with drug addiction or 
alcoholism and they grow up too quick he says i see young men 
out there who are searching for strong male role models when they 
dont see that at home they look to somebody who is strong 
somebody whos making it and thats the drug dealers 
despite the stray bullets the gangs the drugs and the crime 
the bensons want to stay in the neighborhood where they both grew 
up 
tony has tried to make their neighborhood safer he persuaded 
some drug dealers hanging out on his street to take their business 
elsewhere he also tried setting up a crimewatch program to combat 
a rash of burglaries but after a few meetings folks got 
disinterested 
people are busy trying to maintain their own life and their 
own families he says they just dont have time for anybody 
else 
if it becomes unbearable id like to move to a place thats 
quiet with a yard and homeowners on the street says carolyn 
but i dont want to live in a suburb ive lived my whole life 
here

reports issued last year by the national center for health 
statistics paint a grim picture for people in the inner city 
homicide is the leading cause of death for black males ages 15 
to 19 between 1984 and 1987 the rate jumped 53 percent for this 
group the latest figures show that 60 young black males per 
100000 are homicide victims eight out of 10 of those deaths are 
due to firearms the overall homicide rate is six times higher for 
blacks 
fortyone percent of black male teenage deaths are related to 
firearms compared to 16 percent for white male teens drugrelated 
homicides are twice as common for blacks as they are for whites 
innercity residents face a much greater risk of aids 
infection 
the rate of infection rose 51 percent among black males age 13 
and older it increased 30 percent for white males the infection 
rate rose 42 percent for white females but it rose 74 percent 
among black females and 97 percent among hispanic females at risk 
in part because they face a greater chance of having sexual 
partners who are intravenous drug users 
in new york and new jersey aids is the leading cause of death 
among black women ages 15 to 44 aids now is the 10th leading cause 
of death among blacks nationwide it is the 15th for whites 
other diseases take a greater toll on the innercity population 
among blacks the death rate for kidney disease and diabetes is 
more than twice that of whites for influenza and pneumonia the 
rate is 1 times higher hepatitis b strikes blacks at a rate four 
times higher than whites 
black infants face twice the risk of dying as white babies 
all these factors combined to lower black life expectancy in 
1987 the last year data was available white life expectancy rose 
to 756 years up from 744 in 1985 while black life expectancy 
dropped from 697 to 694 years

the vastness of africa south of the sahara is 
matched by the awesome poverty and food shortages in some of the 38 
countries that make up the region 
yet some of those nations have had glimmers of success in 
boosting food production and an agriculture department review 
suggests others could follow if reforms are carried out effectively 
the report by shahla shapouri and stacy rosen of the 
departments economic research service said marketoriented 
reforms better weather and more help from the world community have 
helped brighten the outlook for some of the subsaharan countries 
poverty is rampant the regions 38 countries have a combined 
gross national product the sum value of all goods and services in 
a year of about 150 billion about the same as belgiums 
but the regions population is 500 million about 50 times that 
of belgium since 1965 population has grown at the rate of 3 
percent a year doubling since then 
arable farmland taken for granted in the united states and many 
other countries is at a premium in subsaharan africa 
of the 38 countries 13 do not have enough arable land to meet 
the needs of growing populations under subsistence farming 
practices these are botswana burundi ethiopia kenya lesotho 
malawi mauritania niger nigeria rwanda senegal somalia and 
uganda 
these nations account for onethird of the regions land area 
and half of its population the report said however several 
have vast amounts of land that is underutilized because of 
rudimentary farming practices the report also cited government 
taxing policies 
one of the major problems of agriculture in the developing world 
is the availability and proper use of materials that can boost 
production these include fertilizer improved seed pesticides 
irrigation and other inputs that have become commonplace in the 
developed world 
but throughout subsaharan africa capital inputs are seldom 
applied to food production the report said 
fertilizer and tractor use is the lowest in the world and for 
the most part uneconomical it added thats because grower 
prices are often held down by government policies 
for example researchers found that the use of fertilizer in the 
region averages about 56 kilograms per hectare compared with 26 
kilos in india and 48 kilos in mexico a kilogram is about 22 
pounds and a hectare is 247 acres 
crop varieties are mostly traditional and although adapted to 
the harsh climate yields are low even under favorable growing 
conditions the report said 
thus it would follow that any improvement in technology 
should substantially affect productivity in the regions 
agriculture 
for example in some areas of zimbabwe zambia and kenya use 
of hybrid corn has increase yields to 5 to 7 tons per hectare more 
than four times the regions average the report said 
a metric ton of 2205 pounds is equal to about 394 bushels 
five to seven tons per hectare 247 acres would be in the range 
of 197 of about 80 to 97 bushels per acre 
by comparison the average us corn yield this fall was 
estimated in august at 739 tons per hectare or 1177 bushels per 
acre 
the report noted however that the foreign agricultural 
organization of the united nations has said that improved methods 
and greater investment in inputs might not be enough in all 
countries in the region 
arable land is in such short supply in several subsaharan 
countries including burundi lesotho mauritania rawanda and 
somalia that they could not achieve selfsufficiency by the turn 
of the century even if their technologies were to match those now 
used in asia and latin america the report said 
still changes in government policies so farmers would have 
higher prices and other incentives would boost total production 
a realistic price policy however is only one essential 
element in a comprehensive government package designed to increase 
output the report said further government actions on wage 
rates interest rates population control trade and food aid are 
needed to ensure agricultures growth 
structural adjustment policies have been adopted by many 
subsaharan countries but researchers found that response has been 
mixed 
even under the reforms governments in most countries of the 
region continue to control many agricultural prices marketing and 
farm input supplies the report said

jet fuel costs have soared since iraq invaded 
kuwait but its anyones guess whether an airline ticket will cost 
you more or less in coming months 
indications are that theyre going up said raymond e 
neidl an airline analyst with dillon read amp co inc airlines 
are getting around that by jacking up the basic fare and then 
offering various discounts 
for the time being some fares are rising and others are falling 
in a phenomenon that neidl described monday as turmoil in 
pricing 
the latest price changes are a temporary round of cheaper fares 
to europe 
trans world and northwest announced over the weekend that they 
were offering some special low fares on transatlantic flights for 
fall and winter tickets purchased by sept 21 on monday airlines 
saying they would follow suit included usair and pan am 
other carriers were studying the overseas fare cut they are 
also keeping an eye on what comes from a round of domestic fare 
increases that were announced recently by pan am and alaska air 
group 
since the persian gulf crisis began the price airlines pay for 
jet fuel has shot up some 40 percent from around 60 cents per 
gallon to between 80 and 90 cents per gallon 
that rise puts the sluggish airline industry in a bind if crude 
oil maintains its current high price airlines can expect to pay an 
additional 45 billion per year for fuel according to an industry 
group the air transport association 
finding a way to pay for more expensive fuel is not easy any 
airline that goes out on a limb by raising fares runs the risk of 
losing business in the highly competitive market 
last month the major us carriers said they would raise their 
domestic fares by 53 percent in response to the inflated cost of 
jet fuel but analysts and industry sources said the higher fares 
would not pick up the entire increase in the industrys jet fuel 
tab 
two airlines then decided they would charge fliers more money on 
domestic flights 
alaska air announced an additional 47 percent fare increase to 
take effect oct 1 and pan am announced an additional 44 percent 
fare increase to take effect sept 18 
neidl said alaska air can probably pull off its increase 
because it is a regional carrier that serves some alaska 
destinations that other airlines cannot reach he found pan ams 
move intriguing 
pan am is never going to get away with that if other airlines 
dont match it neidl said monday theyre going to have a hard 
time holding that because theyre going to lose traffic 
domestically pan am is too small to be a price leader he said 
pan am spokeswoman elizabeth hlinko would not say whether her 
carrier is concerned about scaring off travelers 
this is something were monitoring ms hlinko said at 
this point were planning on putting it the increase into 
effect 
other airlines said monday they were watching pan ams move but 
none would say whether it was considering a similar increase 
before we would strongly consider a fare increase we would 
have to see jet fuel costs remain high northwest spokesman doug 
miller said we certainly dont want to raise fares you always 
run the risk of inhibiting traffic 
neidl viewed the cheaper fares to europe as a temporary 
marketing strategy that airlines often use in an attempt to lure 
discretionary travelers nonbusiness passengers who might 
decide on a relatively short notice to take an overseas vacation 
this happens all the time during the slow seasons he said 
you dont want to fill up all your seats that way 
after oct 1 international flights might start costing more 
the international air transport association recently agreed to fare 
increases of 5 percent to 8 percent that are still being processed 
by various governments 
some us airlines plan to go along with those increases while 
others were not yet ready to say what they will do

two federal bank regulators say they are still 
at odds over the amount of capital that banks should maintain to 
avoid a savings and loanlike debacle in the banking industry 
in testimony before a senate panel monday the controller of the 
currency and the head of the federal deposit insurance corp said 
their dispute has narrowed since january but they still disagree 
firmly on lowering the capital standards for all banks 
fdic chairman l william seidman said a drop in federal 
requirements so that banks must maintain capital standards of at 
least 3 percent of assets should be limited to only the healthiest 
of the nations 12400 banks 
but controller of the currency robert l clarke thinks raising 
the standard any higher would supercede plans to make a riskbased 
capital standard the primary focus for evaluating the adequacy of a 
banks capital 
by the end of this year all banks and thrifts will be required 
to have 725 percent capital to riskadjusted assets that ratio 
will grow to 8 percent by the end of 1992 
seidman told the senate banking committee that he and clarke 
agree on many more things than we disagree on but i dont 
think we can continue with these differences without causing real 
harm to the system 
capital is the basic yardstick for measuring a financial 
institutions soundness the more capital a bank has the more 
losses it can absorb without failing conversely the less capital 
the more likely losses could force a failure 
legislation passed by congress last year set minimum capital 
standards for savings and loans but there is no minimum set by law 
for the amount of cash and assets easily converted into cash banks 
must have to offset the risk of loans and investments 
currently the federal reserve board the fdic and the office of 
the controller of the currency have a gentlemans agreement that 
banks must maintain a leverage ratio capital to total assets of 
6 percent 
the fed has adopted new standards effective dec 31 that would 
require the most highlyrated banks to have at least a 3 percent 
ratio of capital to total assets with other banks required to have 
another 1 percent or 2 percent in capital 
seidman said he was willing to go along with that as a 
compromise although the fdic chairman preferred the ratio up around 
45 percent 
but the occ which oversees some 4000 national banks around the 
country wants to set the requirement at 3 percent for all banks 
seidman said that was too low and would reduce the capital 
requirements of some 10000 banks 
there are three lines of defense in keeping industry losses to 
a minimum and avoiding a taxpayer bailout sen donald w riegle 
jr dmich the committee chairman said at the hearings start 
the first is careful lending practices at banks and thrifts he 
said the second is the capital maintained by financial 
institutions and the third is the federal deposit insurance fund 
asked by riegle if the agencies could settle their differences 
controller of the currency robert clarke said the differences are 
extremely minimal 
but seidman shook his head during clarkes answer 
this disagreement may sound like regulators splitting hairs 3 
percent and 45 percent theres only a 15 percent difference but 
it is a very material difference when one looks at the banking 
system insisted seidman 
at 3 percent he said substantially all smaller banks would 
have a lower minimum standard eliminating a check on financial 
institutions with potential exposure to interest rate risks 
riegle asked seidman and clarke who were joined at the hearing 
by fed governor wayne d angell and timothy ryan director of the 
office of thrift supervision to try and work out their differences 
and report back to him in 30 days

michael milken who pleaded guilty to six 
felonies to settle securities fraud charges is expected to face a 
slew of new allegations the government hopes will induce a judge to 
stiffen his prison sentence 
the government agreed not to indict milken for any other 
financial crimes when it accepted his guilty plea in april but 
federal courts have allowed prosecutors to air a range of charges 
at sentencing that a defendant hasnt been convicted of or pleaded 
guilty to 
milken the former head of drexel burnham lambert incs 
highyield bond department admitted six felonies and agreed to pay 
600 million in penalties to settle a 98count fraud and 
racketeering indictment 
attorneys said monday the government will detail a host of other 
unproven crimes before us district judge kimba wood as she 
prepares to sentence milken oct 1 
wood could refuse to consider any new charges outright as 
happened in a case before another judge this year or she could 
scheduled a hearing on the claims that might include testimony by 
admitted inside trader ivan boesky 
assistant us attorney john carroll said the government was to 
present its report to wood on thursday he declined to comment on 
the contents but stressed the governments right to go beyond 
milkens guilty plea 
under the plea agreement signed by milken the government can 
bring to the courts attention conduct that was not included in 
the plea milken also agreed not to dispute making the governments 
final sentencing report public 
the justice department agreed not to request a specific 
sentence milken faces a maximum 28 years in prison the charges to 
which he pleaded guilty were not among the most serious in the 
indictment 
milken is entitled to rebut any charges the government may make 
in its sentencing report and can defend himself at a hearing which 
either side can ask the judge to hold 
attorneys for former milken associates who cooperated with the 
governments nearly fouryear investigation said they had been told 
that prosecutors planned to bring their full case against milken to 
woods attention 
weve gotten wind of such a hearing said aubrey harwell 
jr who represents former drexel bond salesman cary maultasch 
we understand the government is contemplating calling 
numerous witnesses 
a spokesman for milken declined to comment 
such hearings which can include evidence testimony and 
crossexamination as at a trial are rare attorneys said a milken 
hearing could last up to three months and feature testimony by 
boesky who served two years in prison after settling insider 
trading charges boesky was milkens chief accuser 
earlier this year us district judge pierre n leval refused 
to admit charges that former goldman sachs amp co arbitrager robert 
m freeman committed 20 crimes in addition to a single charge of 
insider trading he admitted 
the government of course had the opportunity to charge the 
defendant with those 20 crimes instead it made a plea bargain with 
the defendant agreeing to prosecute this single charge he 
wrote 
but leval added that it was not necessarily improper for the 
government to point to other offenses adding to its call for a 
hefty sentence the milken case may qualify because of its scope 
and the wide public attention it has generated 
attorneys said no matter how devastating the new charges milken 
would be unlikely to request a public hearing because testimony 
could add to the hundreds of pending civil lawsuits stemming from 
his crimes 
the sentencing report is less damaging than having all the 
evidence laid out said one attorney who asked not to be named 
it provides a road map to civil plaintiffs it doesnt give it to 
them on a silver platter 
the rationale for allowing unindicted criminal allegations is 
that a judge should consider negative information at sentencing as 
well as positive information such as letters from friends 
a federal appeals court in 1980 endorsed the practice in an 
organized crime case the decision was upheld by the supreme court 
even though many lawyers maintain its unfair to defendants 
since when in this country can you go to jail for things a 
jury hasnt found you guilty of at a hearing where hearsay is 
admissible and by a standard that is less than proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt asked gerald lefcourt attorney for former 
drexel trader bruce newberg who was indicted along with milken 
last year and convicted in a separate case

most noneconomic national contract issues have 
been wrapped up by united auto workers union and general motors 
corp negotiators leaving tough issues for the last four days of 
bargaining 
a uaw source speaking monday on the condition of anonymity 
said tentative agreements have been reached on nearly all 
noneconomic issues facing bargainers working against a midnight 
friday deadline 
theres not too much left he said 
bargaining continued over the most important issue job 
security negotiators are making progress but the source declined 
to give details 
while most issues have economic considerations noneconomic 
issues typically include military leave legal assistance and union 
dues checkoff frequently negotiators strive to resolve 
noneconomic issues early so they can concentrate on the tougher 
economic points including job security wages and benefits time 
off and pension matters 
uaw vice president stephen yokich said last thursday that about 
half of the noneconomic issues had been resolved and the pace of 
negotiations at that point was faster than he has seen in any set 
of talks 
uaw national contracts with gm ford motor co and chrysler 
corp expire at midnight friday the union is focusing bargaining 
at gm which has about 300000 uawcovered employees 
the union has said that after a contract is ratified at the 
worlds largest automaker it will be used as a pattern for 
agreements with ford and chrysler 
negotiations between the union and ford and chrysler have been 
put on ice since gm was chosen as the uaws bargaining target late 
last month 
ford sent home all of its national negotiators last week to 
concentrate on local contracts spokesman dick routh said monday 
there are 79 uaw locals at ford facilities and four have reached 
local agreements all of which expire friday like the national 
contract he said 
at chrysler uaw and company negotiators have been meeting 
occasionally in subcommittees focused on certain areas of the 
contract such as wages job security or health and safety company 
spokesman lee sechler said local agreements at about 60 uaw locals 
at chrysler facilities remain unresolved 
expiration dates on those agreements vary but most of the 
assembly plant contracts expire friday 
the tone of the negotiations between the union and gm has been 
quiet little public information has leaked out of the fifthfloor 
negotiating suite at the gm building just north of downtown detroit

windfall oil profits the result of 
increased production and higher prices have given saudi arabia a 
painless way to finance much of the cost of the us military 
deployment in the persian gulf industry analysts say 
an irony of the crisis is that iraqi president saddam hussein is 
effectively paying for the military might thats been arrayed 
against him 
the crisis triggered by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait has 
pushed oil prices up from around 15 a barrel to as high as 32 
prices are higher partly because of the un embargo on iraqi 
and kuwaiti output which has taken about 4 million barrels a day 
off the market 
the saudis and the united arab emirates are picking up most of 
the slack to replace those 4 million barrels saudi arabia alone 
has boosted production from 53 million barrels a day to around 75 
million without incurring any increased production costs 
almost all the increased production comes from saudi aramco the 
saudi governmentowned refining and exporting corporation in which 
the major american oil companies once had a share 
but us and saudi officials said aramco easily increased its 
production without spending a dime 
it still costs only 1 125 to get a barrel of oil out of 
the ground beyond 75 million barrels a day they incur extra 
costs said an american official who spoke on condition he was 
not identified 
the result is a windfall estimated at 100 million a day more 
than enough to pay part of the cost of keeping foreign troops on 
saudi soil to protect king fahds throne 
saudi officials have refused to say how much they will 
contribute to the us operation but one said americans wont 
be disappointed in what saudi arabias willing to do 
the ease with which saudi aramco boosted production was 
underscored by the american official who said they did it on 
short notice without an increase in marginal cost 
furthermore nassr ajmi aramcos executive vice president said 
the corporation could keep up production levels of 75 million 
barrels a day indefinitely without incurring higher costs 
higher prices will be good in the short run said prince 
abdullah bin faisal head of the royal commission for the 
industrial port cities of jubail on the gulf and yanbu on the red 
sea coast 
if however saudi arabia wants to produce even more oil it 
has the largest reserves in the world it must pay to do so 
officials say saudi aramcos plans to increase its sustainable 
capacity to 10 million barrels a day would involve substantial new 
investment in plant and equipment 
estimates are that aramco plans to spend 10 billion to 14 
billion on its expansion 
another variable for aramco is personnel about 3000 americans 
are employed by the corporation many in key techological and 
management jobs 
more than 13000 other foreigners mainly asians on contract 
work are employed by the oil giant the saudis make up the 
remainder of 50000strong workforce 
there have been reports of widespread resignations since iraqs 
invasion of kuwait but aramco officials said only 27 americans 
have quit recently 
saudis and american businessmen both say that in boom times 
filling even key jobs is not a problem but it may cost money in 
the form of higher salaries and more incentives 
in a time of crisis one can buy expatriates said dr bakr 
abdullah bakr rector of the king fahd university of petroleum and 
minerals

federal regulators have blocked columbia 
savings amp loan from selling 3 billion of its junk bonds to a group 
of canadian and hong kong investors 
regulators said monday that the troubled thrift failed to seek 
any allcash bids columbia chief edward g harshfield said in a 
brief statement that the thrift obtained the most favorable bid 
the office of thrift supervision also said it could not approve 
the sale in its current form because the troubled thrift neglected 
to seek an adequate number of bids for the junk bond portfolio 
columbia at one time had the thrift industrys largest portfolio 
of highyield highrisk junk bonds the thrift is based in beverly 
hills 
the los angeles times in todays editions quoted unidentified 
sources as saying l william seidman would support a cash deal in 
which columbia gets rid of the junk bonds for good 
seidman chairs the federal deposit insurance corp and the 
resolution trust corp the agency formed last year to handle 
failing thrifts 
regulators have held off seizing columbia while its managers 
tried to find a buyer for the junk bonds despite the fact that the 
thrift is insolvent 
columbia was 350 million in the red according to the latest 
report largely due to the declining value of the junk bond 
portfolio but also because of recent real estate losses 
in late july columbia agreed to sell the bonds for 3 billion 
to a partnership assembled by gordon investment corp a merchant 
bank based in new york and toronto a principal of gordon 
investment is hong kong billionaire entrepreneur li kashing who 
could not be reached for comment 
under the proposed deal gordon america lp would have paid 300 
million down and given columbia a 10year note for the remaining 
27 billion at an interest rate of 105 percent 
if the value of the bonds fell 10 percent below the purchase 
price the buyers could have walked away from the deal losing 
their down payment but avoiding further losses 
in that case the junk bonds would have wound up back in the 
hands of columbia and if the thrift were seized of the 
taxpayers 
in its announcement the ots said the proposed 10year 
nonrecourse note for 90 percent of the purchase price raised a 
significant legal issue under the sampl bailout legislation enacted 
last year 
i hope additional bids will result in a proposal that we 
can quickly approve ots director timothy ryan said in a 
statement we appreciate the manner in which the current 
management of columbia has dealt with this and other problems 
inherited from the thomas spiegel era 
spiegel the former chief executive officer of columbia has 
been accused by the regulators of breaching his duty to columbias 
shareholders and showing a reckless disregard for the law that 
resulted in excessive personal enrichment spiegel has denied the 
allegations 
the ots announced last thursday that it had added a new 
allegation against spiegel who had earlier been accused of 
squandering 19 million 
the agency now accuses spiegel of causing a 292 million loss 
to columbia from the construction of a new headquarters building 
without any attempt to limit costs the new building included a 
large multilevel gymnasium and survival chamber bathrooms with 
bulletproof glass and an independent air and food supply the ots 
said 
spiegel who feared a terrorist attack also has been accused of 
spending at least 91000 of columbias funds to buy an assortment 
of about 80 guns 
columbia which is trying to sell the building has removed the 
gymnasium and the elaborate bathrooms the building cost columbia 
more than 547 million and has a market value of around 24 
million according to the ots 
the new charge put spiegel at the top of the list of sampl 
executives from whom regulators are seeking compensation he is 
followed by charles keating jr the former head of the collapsed 
lincoln savings and loan association in irvine

relatively stable car sales 
will force mercedesbenz to pay more than 18 million in 
fuelconsumption penalties next year company executives say 
if you build large automobiles as mercedesbenz does it will 
be very difficult for anybody to deal with it albert weiss 
general marketing manager for mercedesbenz of north america inc 
said monday of potentially higher fueleconomy standards 
congress is considering a bill that would boost the corporate 
average fuel economy standard by 20 percent in 1995 and by 40 
percent in 2001 that would push the current 275 miles per gallon 
standard to around 40 mpg by the end of the century 
companies selling cars in the united states must pay a penalty 
if the average fuel economy rating for those cars doesnt meet 
certain standards a gasguzzler tax may also be imposed on the 
companys least efficient models 
youre not going to have a 4000pound car with 40 miles per 
gallon and have performance weiss said 
mercedesbenzs corporate average fuel economy in 1990 is 212 
mpg which forced the company to pay about 186 million in 
fueleconomy penalties for this year said peter patrone the 
companys product planning manager in 1989 the company paid 204 
million for an average fuel economy of 214 mpg 
the decrease in penalty and average fuel economy stemmed from a 
09 percent drop in sales of mercedes cars between the two years 
patrone and weiss said through the first eight months of 1990 
mercedes has sold 48029 cars 
company officials dont expect the 1991 penalty to differ much 
from 1990 because sales and fuel efficiency should be relatively 
the same 
comments by weiss and patrone came as the company introduced its 
18car lineup of 1991 models half of those vehicles will be 
assessed a gasguzzler tax ranging from 500 to 1300 depending 
on the vehicle 
without the gasguzzler taxes base prices for 1991model cars 
range from 28050 for the 190e with a 23liter fourcylinder 
engine and a manual transmission to 89300 for the 500sl with a 
5liter v8 engine and an automatic transmission 
the two sl coupes the 300sl with a 3liter engine and the 
500sl were redesigned for the 1990 model year weiss and patrone 
said company officials were surprised at the popularity of the 
500sl version despite its higher price tag and lower 16mpg 
average 
about 75 percent of the car models sold last year were the 
500sl they said 
that indicates that buyers of mercedes cars arent worried as 
much about the fuel efficiency of their automobiles since iraq 
invaded kuwait nearly six weeks ago mercedes dealers havent 
reported any slowdown in sales weiss said 
the cost of fuel doesnt seem to be a problem at this time 
he said for the 1990 model year mercedes expanded availability of 
diesel engines which are more fuelefficient than samesize 
gasoline engines 
for 1991 the company will offer three cars with turbocharged 
diesel engines in the united states except for california the 
dieselpowered cars flunk stringent california emissions standards 
one diesel car the 350sd turbo is new for 1991 the 190e 23 
is the only other new car the company is introducing for the 1991 
model year 
mercedes is offering two new kinds of traction control devices 
for its 1991model cars

the chilean exporters association is accusing 
the us food and drug administration of contaminating two chilean 
grapes with cyanide and setting off a public health scare in march 
1989 
a report issued by the association in washington and santiago 
chile concluded that based on scientific studies the grapes 
could not have been tampered with in chile or at the port of 
philadelphia where the poisoned grapes were found 
the grapes were contaminated at the fda laboratory in 
philadelphia the report said the manner in which the 
contamination took place could have been accidental or 
intentional 
fda officials have said repeatedly that they believe the grapes 
were poisoned in chile before the ship left on its twoweek voyage 
to the united states 
of the reports conclusion fda spokesman bill grigg said we 
think thats preposterous 
the fda went looking for the grapes after the us embassy in 
santiago received an anonymous telephone threat march 2 1989 
after it found the two tainted grapes the fda urged that all 
chilean fruit be removed from us markets while more tests 
continued 
the association estimated the fdas action cost the chileans 
more than 330 million as more than 6 million cases of fruit in the 
united states were destroyed 
the association said research at the university of california at 
davis showed that if the two grapes had been contaminated with 
cyanide other grapes in the same case also would have contained 
the poison however none was found the fda has said 
the studies also showed that because cyanide was found at such 
high levels it would have to have been introduced in the grapes 
more recently than two weeks before when the ship was in chile 
the report said

pizza hut opened its first two soviet restaurants 
today dishing out americanstyle fast food to wideeyed customers 
as perplexed by their spanking clean surroundings as by the menu 
it looks like a museum said sailor yevgeni gerko one of 
about 300 soviets who waited in line for up to four hours for the 
official opening 
we want to know the american style of eating he said 
gazing through the window at pizza huts restaurant along 
kutuzovsky prospekt on which president mikhail s gorbachev drives 
to work 
the second smaller restaurant is on gorky street a main 
thoroughfare near the kremlin that already boasts the only estee 
lauder and christian dior outlets in the country 
just after noon a large deep pan super supreme pizza with 
everything on it came out of the kutuzovsky restaurants oven the 
first of 5000 it expects to serve daily 
waiting customers clutching pizza hut flags emblazoned with 
american and soviet symbols oohed and aahed then tried to rush 
the door pizza hut officials struggled to limit entrance to a 
handful of people at a time 
pizza hut is selling its meals for both dollars and rubles the 
menu is similar to those in the west except only nine pizza 
combinations are offered and no substitutions are permitted a 
special moscow seafood pizza topped with salmon smoked sardines 
and onions was created to appeal to soviet tastes 
people dont know what the products are explained regional 
operations director andy rafalet lets make the choice a little 
easier 
choice was easy at the salad bar no lettuce but lots of 
cabbage a soviet staple 
the kutuzovksy site near a large foreigners compound has 
separate dining rooms for ruble and dollarpaying customers plus 
a takeout counter gorky street has a window selling pizza slices 
for rubles 
the restaurants 300 soviet employees were chosen from 3500 
applicants rafalet said most will earn 300 rubles 480 a month 
slightly higher than the average monthly salary of 250 rubles 
400 
pizza huts parent company pepsico inc of purchase ny has 
been doing business with the soviets for more than 30 years since 
chief executive donald kendall cajoled thenpremier nikita 
khrushchev into tasting pepsi at a 1959 moscow trade fair 
three years ago the moscow city council invited pepsico to 
bring its familyoriented restaurants to the soviet capital the 
city has a 51 percent stake in the joint venture which owns the two 
restaurants 
we hope to revolutionize the food and restaurant industry 
kendall told an opening ceremony 
my 30 years in dealing with the soviets has taught me that 
while initial negotiations can be long and sometimes frustrating 
that once you sign an agreement and open your business the soviets 
are equal to any partner in the entire world 
pizza hut originally announced it would open its moscow 
restauarants in september 1989 but construction did not begin 
until january 
pizza hut says the four ovens in its bigger restaurant can 
produce 5000 pizzas daily and it expects to serve 50000 
customers a week about seven times the turnover of any pizza hut 
in the united states 
mcdonalds moscow outlet still sells 5000 burgers an hour and 
the lunchtime lineup is 90 minutes long 
the restaurants are part of a 3 billion deal in which the 
soviets will build at least 10 ships mostly oil tankers for 
pepsico to sell or lease and pepsicos exclusive right to market 
stolichnaya vodka in the united states was extended to the year 
2000 
in return pepsico agreed to double its soft drink production in 
the soviet union

the hearst corp may buy the 20 percent stake 
that rjr nabisco inc holds in the espn sports cable television 
network published reports said tuesday 
rjr nabisco has been exploring its options on its espn interest 
for more than a year the remaining 80 percent of the cable service 
is owned by capital citiesabc inc the company that owns and 
operates the abc television network 
the wall street journal and the new york times each reported 
tuesday that hearst and rjr nabisco were in talks with hearst about 
selling the stake 
although no agreement has been reached the journal story said 
people familiar with the discussions said hearst may pay 180 
million to 200 million for the stake or below the 250 million 
that it said rjr nabisco had hoped to get 
officials for hearst rjr and capital citiesabc all declined 
comment 
espn is one of the largest cable networks available to about 61 
percent of us households with television it had a pretax profit 
of about 125 million last year but expects lower results this year 
because of losses on its coverage of major league baseball 
rjr nabisco has reportedly had trouble finding a buyer for its 
interest because its stake gives it no management authority over 
the service and no guarantee of a dividend 
rjr nabisco said in august 1989 that it had hired the investment 
firm lazard freres amp co to advise it on its espn stake saying 
several parties had expressed interest in it but that it had not 
decided what to do with it 
the company took that step after being acquired for 245 
billion in april 1989 by a group led by kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co 
hearst which owns magazines and newspapers already has ties to 
capital citiesabc it owns several abcaffiliated television 
stations and is a partner with capital citiesabc in the lifetime 
and arts amp entertainment cable networks

by his own estimate arthur karp has devoted only 
30 days this year to running his chocolatechip cookie business he 
says he has a more pressing mission to sell the world on the 
concept of franchising 
as chairman of the international franchise association karp 
spends most of his time leading business groups on international 
trade missions 
the opportunities have been plentiful since the dearth of 
communism in eastern europe karp said the new democracies are 
hungry for westernstyle products and government officials have 
been bending over backwards to allow us franchises he said 
there are opportunities there for people of vision that are 
just laying around on the street karp said in a recent interview 
at the atlanta offices of his franchised great american chocolate 
chip cookie co 
in the future when they talk about the good old days 
theyre going to be talking about the 1990s 
ifas push in eastern europe comes on the heels of a decade of 
sharp growth in franchising in the united states 
domestic franchises are expected to account for 716 billion in 
retail sales in 1990 a third of the nations total retail sales 
according to ifa thats more than quadruple the 160 billion in 
sales from franchises during 1983 the washingtonbased group said 
the number of franchises is expected to grow to 533000 
establishments this year up from 442400 in 1980 ifa said it 
said a rash of gasoline station shutdowns in the early 1980s had 
offet the establishment of new franchises but the total number of 
franchises has risen steadily since 1984 
under a franchise agreement a company grants a franchisee the 
right to sell its products or services in a certain area the 
franchiser usually provides business guidance promotional 
assistance financing and other benefits in exchange for a 
percentage of the sales or profits 
the support system behind the arrangement provides a safety net 
for the franchisee that leaves less room for error as a business 
develops karp said 
youre not reinventing the wheel he said we the 
franchiser have probably run into the problem that that individual 
is facing 100 times before and weve learned how to handle it 
from marketing to construction to purchasing to whatever it is 
economist al niemi agreed that eastern europe presents favorable 
opportunities for selling consumer goods though he cautioned that 
those going there in search of a quick buck likely will be 
disappointed 
its going to take longer than some people think said 
niemi dean of the university of georgia college of business 
administration theres a basic infrastructure there that needs 
to be rebuilt 
niemi said the demand for consumer goods in the former communist 
strongholds is enormous to suddenly provide a usstyle variety 
of products he said would be like going to fantasy land 
john amos executive director of dallasbased i cant believe 
its yogurt said he has made contacts in eastern europe from his 
participation in ifa trade missions but he said he believes it 
will be a few years before poles and romanians are licking yogurt 
cones 
i think there are enormous opportunities in the eastern bloc 
countries but it will be some time before the logistical system is 
in place to support the growth amos said you can take almost 
any commodity there on the back of a semi and sell it but there 
are no systems in place to support distribution 
in addition to the eastern bloc countries karp also has led 
trade missions to australia switzerland france spain and mexico 
during his oneyear term as head of ifa 
karps role usually involves meeting with government officials 
while representatives of the companies seek contacts with local 
business leaders karp said he has encountered no hostility toward 
the importing of us franchises and dismissed the notion that the 
traveling companies would be viewed as moving in to take business 
away from local entrepreneurs 
theyre not just going in and opening businesses he said 
theyre seeking local people 
the mcdonalds in madrid is run by spaniards it employs 
spaniards and pays taxes to the government of spain the american 
concept of retailing is still the best in the world and were 
exporting that

lance lundberg surveys the businesses in his 
portfolio much like a card player eyeing his hand 
there have been cable tv companies in need of broadcasting 
equipment a cruise line that could use some advertising exposure 
and a papermaker with a surplus of baby wipes 
the companies needs were skillfully matched through swaps and 
trades that lundberg a 34yearold harvard mba arranged under the 
ageold system known as bartering 
bartering has been around since cave days and continues to be a 
method of commerce among corporations of every size worldwide 
according to the alexandria vabased international reciprocal 
trade association more than 400 exchanges help an estimated 
220000 businesses usually small ones trade goods and services 
but exchanges account for only a fraction of the pie when 
direct swaps among large corporations are considered industry 
experts say barter is responsible for up to 12 billion of domestic 
trade a year 
lundbergs icon international puts a new twist on what 
traditionally is a quid pro quo transaction by footing the bill 
himself in many cases lundberg is leveraged into the transaction 
which makes him more of a financier than just a stockpiler of 
surplus goods and services 
take for example a cable televison channel that needs 
broadcasting equipment i purchase it the equipment lease it 
to them and over the life of the lease take payment in a stream of 
30second commercial units lundberg said 
since the price of air time has been increasing at an average 30 
percent a year lundberg is left holding a portfolio much like a 
portfolio of stocks i can trade out when i think values have 
peaked 
by trading out he means swapping the commercials for say 
radisson hotel rooms or from time to time lundberg trades 
merchandise for cash like the baby wipes he sold for james river 
corp you cant endlessly trade or you wont have money to pay 
the light bill he said 
much of icons success resulted from lundbergs apt targeting of 
oncefledgling cable tv channels like financial news network espn 
and arts amp entertainment which had spare capacity at low cost the 
cable clients got at a very early developmental stage cashfree 
financing while lundberg cheaply built a foundation from which to 
trade 
now hes building another base in the travel and accommodation 
industry all inventory is computerized and is periodically 
reviewed so values can be reassessed 
four years into his venture lundberg boasts an impressive 
client list including 3m corp james river the raddisson hotel 
chain norwegian cruise line time warner inc and people magazine 
icon began taking shape in 1985 when lundberg met john fentener 
van vlissingen a wealthy dutch businessman and chief executive of 
hollands noro group noro helped set up meetings with 
sophisticated substantial individuals as lundberg refers to 
them so he could pitch his idea 
within six months 60 european investors had anted up 60000 
each for a piece of a mutual fund another 500000 was raised 
through a separate pool of us investors 
lundberg was somewhat surprised at the interest in his new 
venture selling a new idea is sometimes easier than selling an 
operating business he said youre really enthusiastic 
youre in there selling sizzle when you get going youre selling 
steak and theres a big difference 
today icon is a 20plus million company growing at an annual 
rate of 60 percent lundberg now employes a staff of 25 at a 
midtown manhattan office so new that the companys name has not yet 
been stenciled on the front doors annual returns have been 
volatile but never negative and have averaged 16 percent a 
year he said 
born in amherst mass lundberg studied english and 
administrative sciences at yale university before moving on to 
harvard university he left the consulting firm booz allen amp 
hamilton to found a company that oversaw a network of cash 
machines i cant say it was a success but we preserved our 
investors capital and learned a lot he said 
so far the boyish lundberg has received high marks from 
clients daniel infanti a spokesman at sharp electronics corp in 
mahwah nj said his company has dealt exclusively with lundberg 
in a handful of deals involving laptop computers fax supplies and 
other office goods valued anywhere from 100000 to more than 1 
million 
the use of barter helps us in times when we have distressed 
merchandise infanti said it gives us a good outlet for 
products that become outdated in a very short period of time 
but infanti said that generally barter is the type of business 
relationship that makes most manufacturers uneasy there is very 
high turnover in the barter companies and you dont always get 
what you think youre getting 
jeff stutin director of marketing services for norwegian cruise 
line in coral gables fla echoed that sentiment with some barter 
companies youll end up with things you werent exactly 
expecting like prices of tv spots that were double what they 
normally would be he said 
lundberg said the large capital base he started with made it a 
lot eaiser to deliver quality goods and unlike many traditional 
barter exchanges he doesnt do most of his business in distressed 
merchandise 
by the end of the year lundberg will decide whether to open a 
european office which also could begin by targeting emerging cable 
tv networks 
he said a handful of major companies have expressed an interest 
in acquiring icon and hes not necessarily adverse to the notion 
but hes keeping mum on what he wants in exchange for his company

gov bob martinez today asked state 
agencies to cut their budgets 5 percent in the wake of gloomy 
economic forecasts projecting a more than 500 million shortfall in 
tax collections 
obviously now the budget was adopted based on a forecast that 
isnt living up to its billing and were going to have to make that 
change martinez said its never easy to do but its the only 
responsible thing to do 
the governor and the states elected cabinet members will likely 
make the actual reductions which could include layoffs and service 
cuts at their sept 25 meeting after the agencies report back with 
recommendations sasid state budget director patti woodworth 
state economists monday night came up with a new tax collection 
forecast for the fiscal year that began july 1 showing a reduction 
of 5218 million from the estimate made in the spring 
that amount would be cut from the 114 billion in general state 
revenues that fuel the 274 billion budget 
when july collections came in 488 million below projections 
the governor and cabinet imposed a freeze on hiring purchases and 
some travel the new cuts are likely to go much further 
woodworth said she couldnt predict whether agencies would have 
to lay off workers but that some services would have to be pared 
weve got to take a look at our priorities and see what we 
need to fund and what we can put off until next year she said 
i think some services are going to be affected 
the legislature approved some 15 billion in new taxes during 
the spring session but it wasnt enough to make up for the lagging 
collections in existing taxes 
the major culprit is the sales tax which will come in some 300 
million below the original projection

oil prices fell this morning as traders realized 
there was no truth to the mideast rumors that pushed crude futures 
contracts into a late afternoon surge on monday 
light sweet crude dropped 60 cents to 3070 per barrel on the 
new york mercantile exchange in late morning trading of october 
contracts 
the main reason was that europe traded down because they 
realized the rumor wasnt true that was the one on jordan said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc

the usjapanese relationship which has been 
strained in recent years because of a huge trade imbalance could 
be headed for more bumps in the road over the issue of support for 
the campaign against iraq 
members of congress were using strong words such as greedy 
and contemptible to described their feelings monday about 
japans failure to be more generous in response to president bushs 
request for the allies to bear a greater share of the burden in the 
persian gulf crisis 
treasury secretary nicholas brady met with japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu last friday to ask that japan more than 
double the 1 billion contribution it has proposed making to 
support the persian gulf effort 
brady however left tokyo without any commitments for increased 
aid 
they are acting totally within the character that they usually 
do they are motivated by profit greed and avarice said sen 
alfonse damato rny theirs is an attitude that i think really 
is repugnant 
to express displeasure with the level of support the senate on 
monday adopted a resolution threatening a deterioration in us 
relations with any nation that doesnt contribute enough 
in tokyo today a japanese official said japan was considering 
giving 2 billion to the three nations hardest hit by the economic 
sanctions against iraq that would be on top of 1 billion the 
country has already pledged to support the military effort against 
iraq 
hiroyasu horio an official of the ministry of international 
trade and industry said the 2 billion would go to egypt jordan 
and turkey news reports in tokyo said the money would be extended 
through the world bank and international monetary fund with the 
first 600 million being sent as early as midseptember 
the senate resolution attached to a spending bill for the 
postal service and other agencies directed the president to 
present congress a detailed report on the administrations 
costsharing efforts by nov 30 
during his consultations with other international leaders 
bush should consider stressing that failure by any country to 
actively contribute in the most appropriate manner for that country 
could have a detrimental impact on its bilateral relationship with 
the united states the resolution said 
the approval of the measure the first such congressional action 
since bush ordered us troops to saudi arabia reflected 
lawmakers reaction to complaints by voters that the united states 
is shouldering too much of the burden 
the united states cannot play uncle sugar to the world said 
sen dennis deconcini dariz one of the primary sponsors 
sen john mccain rariz called japans 1 billion pledge only 
a few token shillings he contended that a more adequate 
response given japans economic standing would be an 8 billion 
pledge 
the contemptible tokenism of the actions of the japanese 
government to date merit nothing but the worlds contempt and 
american hostility mccain said if combat arises it will not 
be japanese boys whose lives are at risk it will be american 
boys 
japan which ran up a 49 billion trade surplus with the united 
states last year was singled out for the bulk of the criticism 
but senators said they also were unhappy with the response so far 
by west germany which has agreed to supply air and sea transport 
but turned down a us request for more help in defraying the costs 
of keeping troops in the persian gulf 
west germany and japan both contend that their postworld war ii 
constitutions bar them from sending troops to the persian gulf 
the united states is seeking approximately 28 billion through 
the end of 1991 for the gulf campaign of that amount 10 billion 
would go to supply aid to egypt turkey and jordan and the 
remainder would pay for the us military buildup 
while brady had little luck getting much more than words of 
encouragement from france britain south korea and japan last 
week secretary of state james a baker iii reported more success 
on a similar fundraising mission to oilrich middle eastern 
nations 
baker said monday that saudi arabia the united arab emirates 
and the exiled government of kuwait had pledged 12 billion split 
between the military effort and the economic assistance package 
but some critics charged that consumers from america and other 
countries were in reality footing the bill through higher energy 
prices 
edwin rothschild head of the consumer group citizen action 
said the saudis stood to make an extra 32 billion monthly from 
the crisis based on a 10abarrel rise in oil costs since iraqs 
invasion of kuwait and a 2 millionbarrel per day increase in saudi 
production their share of the us military costs was reportedly 
only 500 million a month 
the administration has been stressing the need for a united 
front against iraqi president saddam hussein something analysts 
say is not helped by the lukewarm reception by some allied 
countries

cuba and romania have struck oil deals with 
iraq and companies elsewhere are trying to continue trade with 
baghdad all in defiance of united nations sanctions a state 
department survey finds 
some eastern european countries also are trying to maintain 
their military sales to iraq said the report made available to 
the associated press 
it said cuba facing a substantial oil deficit because of 
reduced soviet deliveries has received a shipment of iraqi 
petroleum since un sanctions were imposed five weeks ago 
the report added that romania expects to receive oil indirectly 
from iraq 
im authorized to deny most categorically this allegation 
which is absolutely false and without foundation virgil 
constantinescu the romanian ambassador to the united states said 
today 
romania has adhered strictly to the un resolution imposing 
sanctions against iraq and is determined to carry out this policy 
despite the hardships it faces as a consequence of the embargo and 
the blockade 
constantinescu said iraq had offered to ship about 1 million 
metric tons of oil worth 120 million since aug 2 and the 
romanian government had rejected it 
the compilation of efforts to circumvent the embargo was made 
available as concern increased that the sanctions might jeopardize 
the well being of innocent iraqis shortages of goods are said to 
be increasingly widespread 
at their helsinki summit president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev agreed it was appropriate to allow food 
shipments to iraq and occupied kuwait in appropriate 
circumstances 
but they said any such shipments should be subject to careful 
monitoring by appropriate agencies 
bush is banking on the sanctions to force iraqi president saddam 
hussein to withdraw his troops from kuwait 
the updated state department study and previous reports strongly 
suggest that the willingness to comply with the sanctions is less 
than unanimous 
before the summit china and iran indicated a desire to send 
food and medicine to iraq and several other countries said they 
wanted to send humanitarian shipments to their citizens stranded in 
iraq 
the state department report indicated that two unidentified 
western european companies have been attempting to ship food 
clandestinely to iraq syrian farmers are trying to take advantage 
of the countrys long border with iraq for the same purpose it 
said 
the report added that private entrepreneurs in east asia and 
africa also were pursuing trade with iraq 
because of the growing political acceptability of selling to 
iraq goods needed for survival these transactions are regarded as 
somewhat less serious than others mentioned in the report 
the document said some unnamed east european countries are 
attempting to continue military trade with iraq and that several 
western european countries are bidding for a share of the iraqi 
market for manufactured goods 
cuba has had friendly ties with iraq for some time but had 
nonetheless refrained from supporting saddam in the un security 
council where it holds one of 10 rotating seats 
cuba has either supported the council majority or abstained on 
votes applicable to iraq 
cuba has taken delivery of iraqi oil the state department 
report said just two weeks ago cuba announced drastic energy 
conservations measures to compensate for a 2millionton shortfall 
in deliveries from the soviet union 
romanias interest in buying iraqi oil could be related to that 
countrys concern over the fate of its citizens in iraq it has 
indicated a desire to send food and medicine to romanians trapped 
in iraq

the vancouver stock exchange 
slumped to a record low monday following word that a critical 
report on the exchange was being prepared by the abc television 
network 
the exchanges index tied heavily to mining and other resource 
development stocks plunged 1220 points to 67420 surpassing the 
previous record low of 68585 on aug 23 
the vancouver market has been generally soft in recent weeks 
but many analysts blamed the latest decline on nervousness over a 
report believed to be set for broadcast on primetime live 
which has a weekly audience of 10 million to 13 million viewers 
exchange officials said last week that primetime staff 
posing as members of a new york investment club used a hidden 
camera to film three promoters making what were said to be false 
claims and leaking insider information 
a promoter is someone who hypes a stock to investors 
the abc thing has got everyone upset said promoter murray 
pezim who was interviewed with his consent by primetime chief 
correspondent chris wallace 
i could tell right away they were trying to take shots 
pezim said 
severe repercussions followed critical reports on the exchange 
last year in forbes and barrons 
the forbes article came out of the blue but theres some 
anticipation with respect to this report said max meier 
president of pacific international securities inc i would think 
the damage is being done now rather than later 
john wheeler a director of mcdermid st lawrence ltd played 
down the impact of the prospective abc program 
this market is down for lots of good reasons he said 
precious metals have been beaten up badly its the end of the 
drilling season in the north and recent results in eskay creek a 
major gold source in northwestern british columbia have been 
disappointing 
but probably more than anything we are in a global bear 
market and junior stocks all over the world have been beaten up

fourteen traders engaged in systematic cheating 
of customers in the chicago mercantile exchanges japanese yen 
pit a prosecutor said today as two more commodities fraud trials 
got under way 
you will be hearing about whispered conversation after 
whispered conversation assistant us attorney lisa huestes told 
jurors in opening statements 
this case is about systematic cheating of customers in the 
japanese yen pit she said in the courtroom of us district 
judge william t hart in a trial stemming from an fbi sting 
investigation at the worlds two largest futures exchanges 
meanwhile jury selection was completed this morning in the 
other trial being held in the courtroom of judge george marovich 
for soybean traders from the chicago board of trade 
huestes said the government would attempt to show systematic 
collusion between brokers and yen traders at the merc to defraud 
the brokers customers she said the motivation was plain and 
simple greed 
huestes spent most of the first hour of her opening statement 
explaining what the commodities pits are and what futures contracts 
represent 
in both cases the defendants are accused of cheating customers 
while executing their orders on the exchanges trading floors 
the charges stem from an unprecedented undercover investigation 
in which fbi agents posed as corrupt traders they secretly 
taperecorded conversations among traders at the two commodity 
exchanges 
a federal grand jury indicted 48 people in connection with the 
probe twenty have pleaded guilty and one pleaded no contest 
in the first trial to result from the investigation a us 
district court jury in july convicted two swiss franc traders of 
relatively minor trading violations and acquitted a third 
the jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious 
charges including a racketeering count against one of the three 
defendants the men are scheduled to be tried again on those 
charges early next year

a major japanese company has begun marketing 
something consumers have long awaited a videocassette recorder 
that automatically cuts out commercials even the makers own 
and while sales have been good the product has raised the ire 
of television networks which argue that the possibility of fewer 
people viewing commercials may prompt advertisers to pay less for 
air time 
advertisements for the vcrs which are made by mitsubishi 
electric corp and are priced from 600 to 1200boast that with 
this convenient function you can automatically cut commercials 
and enjoy the programs you want to watch without the ads 
the technology is aimed mainly at producing uninterrupted 
recordings of western movies which are often broadcast on two 
audio channels a main channel for the japaneselanguage 
soundtrack and a subchannel for the original language 
the bilingual programming was introduced on major network 
schedules in 1978 after being developed by the japan broadcasting 
corp about a decade earlier 
special signals during these broadcasts which are usually 
reserved for movies news and foreignmade programs serve as a 
cue for the new machines telling them when to start and stop 
recording 
such programs however account for only a fraction of the total 
broadcasting fare rendering mitsubishis autocut capability 
useless for much of the days programming 
even so the idea has made television networks nervous 
two months after mitsubishis videocassette recorder hit the 
market in april japans largest privately owned network the tokyo 
broadcasting system began mixing electronic static with its signal 
to foil the autocut 
if viewers want to edit out commercials themselves they are 
free to do so said tbs spokesman akitsuna furuya but we 
believe that if taping is to be done it should accurately reflect 
what we broadcast 
furuya added that the technology doesnt just edit out 
commercials it also cuts out the movie reviews that come at the 
beginning and end of the broadcast 
the national association of commercial broadcasters a 
federation of japans commercial stations also expressed 
reservations 
commercial television is based on advertising so we obviously 
are against the idea of cutting out ads said an official with 
the association who requested anonymity 
they dont have much of a share in the market yet so we 
havent really been forced to take any position either way but if 
other companies started making similar machines we would probably 
have to protest the official said 
mitsubishi spokesman masahiro suekuni said that when developing 
autocut mitsubishi was also aware that it too could be the 
victim of adediting 
but we decided that was something which couldnt be avoided 
he added that mitsubishi doesnt expect autocut to have 
much effect on broadcasters 
most people will continue to watch tv as it is broadcast he 
said 
the japan video association says nearly 70 percent of all 
japanese homes have a vcr one of the highest ratios in the world 
while not giving exact figures suekuni said mitsubishi has a 
doubledigit share but still lags behind other home electronics 
giants like matsushita which makes panasonic and national brand 
products 
because of the high percentage of homes that already have vcrs 
producers are finding it increasingly difficult to keep sales up 
and have had to seek out new options such as autocut or 
lower prices 
its a slow market in general suekuni said but sales of 
videos with the autocut function have been better than average 
for a new product

a computer services company said tuesday it 
would appeal a judges ruling that it violated an ibm copyright for 
a key component needed to run ibms largest computers 
us district judge thomas n oneill jr in philadelphia ruled 
friday that allenmyland inc violated ibms copyright for the 
microcode needed to operate its 3090 series mainframes oneill 
is scheduled to determine damages at a later date 
allenmyland based in broomall pa reconfigures international 
business machines corp computers for customers such as splitting 
large computers into smaller versions 
oneill found that the company in dividing a computer copied 
ibms microcode for one of the two computers that resulted 
microcode is the circuitry in a computers central processor 
that translates programming commands into language recognized by 
the processor 
under a contract with ibm allenmyland was required to obtain 
the second set of code from ibm said ibm spokesman brian doyle 
the judge also found that allenmyland misrepresented to 
customers that this second set of code came from ibm doyle said 
allenmylands president larry allen said his company contends 
that microcode is part and parcel of the machine and that 
customers should be allowed to alter that 
he said the copied code was used solely in computers owned by 
the same customer from which the copy was made and that 
allenmyland did not sell the copied code to other customers 
in a blow to ibm oneill also ruled that ibms pricing of the 
microcode violates a 34yearold consent decree ibm entered into 
with the justice department relating to competition doyle said ibm

ah robins co was in the wrong place at 
the wrong time in manufacturing the dalkon shield the former 
head of the company said tuesday 
but e claiborne robins jr who was president of the company 
until it was acquired by american home products corp in december 
stopped short of admitting a mistake in putting the intrauterine 
device on the market in 1971 it was withdrawn from sales in 1974 
after questions arose about its safety 
robins spoke to a breakfast meeting of the friends of the 
industry of agriculture in virginia 
it was the first time he has spoken publicly about the dalkon 
shield since ah robins filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
from creditors in august 1985 as claims mounted against the iud 
at the time of the filing robins said the company was spending 
15 million a month on dalkon shieldrelated legal fees and the 
corporate treasury had fallen to 9 million not enough to meet the 
monthly payroll 
robins referred to the dalkon shield as an unfortunate 
incident in an otherwise successful history for the firm which 
was founded in richmond by his grandfather in 1866 robins called 
the business the most successful bankrupt company in the world 
that grew to annual sales of almost 1 billion when it was taken 
over as part of a courtapproved reorganization 
ah robins introduced robitussin cough syrup to the market in 
1949 dimetapp cold medicine in 1961 and acquired chapstick lip 
balm in 1963 robins said he said the company never had a layoff 
and he praised its employees for sticking by during the bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the companys reorganization which received final court 
approval late last year included the creation of a 25 billion 
fund to pay almost 200000 dalkon shield claims claims are still 
being processed by a trust organization that is independent of ah 
robins and its new parent 
since leaving the company robins has gotten involved in the

down from the real estate holding company 
laroche gave up the position on sept 23 to paul e buff who 
was appointed president and chief operating officer

neco

calls he is the companys majority stockholder as well as 
chairman and chief executive officer

felt he had the expertise and understood the company well enough 
to do it 
richard j hayes necos departing treasurer and chief financial 
officer said the geographical distance between vermont and rhode 
island had made the job difficult for buff 
hayes resignation was announced sept 23 he said he would stay 
until a replacement was found

the domestic chicken business and trying to gain a greater stake in 
its sizzler restaurant chain

its 209 us kentucky fried chicken restaurants with pepsico inc 
for pepsico stock worth about 122 million

chicken restaurants in queensland australia and will operate or 
subfranchise a total of 32 sizzler restaurants in australia

organized wholly owned subsidiary called new collins for each of 
the shares in the 34 percent of sizzler restaurants international 
stock it does not already own 
collins chief executive richard p bermingham said the 
restructuring would simplify collins corporate structure and give 
sizzler stockholders a chance at a taxfree swap for a stock with 
increased market liquidity he said the pepsico deal would provide 
taxfree benefits to shareholders

cocoa producing countries were advised tuesday to 
reduce drastically their areas under cultivation because of grim 
prospects if output continues growing as it has in recent years 
increasing oversupply and persistently low prices are indicated 
for cocoa under three of four projected scenarios in a study by the 
international cocoa organization and the genevabased united 
nations conference on trade and development 
the market already has a heavy surplus following six seasons of 
overproduction world stocks are at a record 137 million tons 
according to estimates released last month by the londonbased 
cocoa organization 
in february the price of cocoa dropped to its lowest in 14 
years 
experts are projecting another world surplus in the 199091 
season which begins oct 1 
under the baseline scenario projected by the study world cocoa 
production will peak at 31 million tons in 20012002 compared 
with estimated output of 2361 million tons in 199091 
the biggest increases are foreseen in southeast asia up 62 
percent and africa up 32 percent particularly in the ivory 
coast the worlds biggest producer 
growth in latin america is projected at only 10 percent because 
output is expected to fall in brazil 
demand should also grow through the period the study says but 
not to a projected peak of 31 million tons until 2005 use in 
198990 is estimated at 2211 million tons

k mart corps multibilliondollar 
5year plan to update its discount stores makes this a smart time 
to say attention shoppers with a new logo as well retail 
consultants say 
the company scheduled a news conference wednesday at its oak 
park outlet prototype for its newer brighter stores where a new 
sign was wrapped in a white tarpaulin marked with the old k mart 
symbol 
company officials would not confirm a new logo was in the works 
saying only that a major announcement was planned 
but the detroit free press reported monday that the stores red 
k and turquoise mart were taken down last week the detroit news 
ran a picture tuesday of new shopping carts found out back bearing 
a changed logo 
the new gray carts were marked with a big red k instead of 
following the k in turquoise letters the word mart is inside the k 
in script 
k mart announced plans earlier this year to remodel its stores 
along the lines of the oak park store with its brighter lights and 
wider aisles 
you can change the inside of the store but if you cant get 
the customer in it it doesnt mean anything said linda morris 
retail analyst for pnc financial corp in pittsburgh pa 
morris said a new logo might say to the consumer come in and 
see us were different 
with growing competition from discounters like walmart stores 
inc and daytonhudson corps target chain they obviously have 
to do everything they can to compete said otto grote analyst 
for derby securities in new york 
theyre under a lot of scrutiny to bring the company 
forward bloomfield hills retail consultant frederick marx said 
anthony camilletti of the berkley store design company jon 
greenberg amp associates helped design the oak park store that opened 
last year he said designers talked with k mart officials at that 
time about a storefront design that would integrate a new logo 
k mart may have taken its time making a change because updating 
a symbol as familiar as the red k can be risky camilletti said 
you dont want to alienate that instant recognition

eastern airlines unveiled tuesday its latest 
strategy to try to lure more business travelers but the carriers 
survival was still in doubt at the end of courtappointed trustee 
martin shugrues 100 days campaign 
wednesday marks the end of the campaign marketed through 
perhaps the biggest media blitz in easterns history in which 
shugrue vowed to improve the airline every day and get it headed in 
the right direction 
congratulations were still here he told some 1000 
employees packed into a steamy hangar at miami international 
airport we intend to be here for a good long while 
he also unveiled the companys new strategy for the business 
traveler under it eastern is nearly doubling the size of its 
firstclass cabins while offering a new corporate rate for 
firstclass travel that it says is 15 to 35 percent below fullfare 
coach rates of its major competitors 
on its b757 planes for example eastern will have as of oct 1 
28 firstclass seats compared to 16 an atlantachicago 
corporate rate will be 313 available for 247 if purchased 
three days in advance 
the industryaverage fullcoach rate is 379 eastern said and 
the average firstclass rate is 565 
neil monroe delta airlines spokesman said the atlantabased 
competitor doesnt anticipate trying to match the eastern fares 
shugrue said the airline was filling more seats from 54 percent 
in may to nearly 73 percent in august but the carrier needs more 
highpaying frequentflying business travelers its summer 
passenger growth was spurred by sharply discounted fares geared 
toward vacationing families 
during questioning from mostly enthusiastic employees and then 
mostly skeptical journalists shugrue insisted his goal had been 
accomplished easterns passenger load and ontime performance are 
up and customer complaints are down he said 
he did acknowledge that eastern still must climb from a large 
deep hole 
airlines dont get in trouble in 100 days and they dont get 
out of trouble in 100 days shugrue said were not there yet 
we still have a very long way to go 
shugrue had little specific progress to report on two goals 
financial viability and labor peace he set in april when a 
federal bankruptcy judge put him in charge of the troubled carrier 
moving aside controversial chairman frank lorenzo 
in the second quarter eastern posted an operating loss of 
2344 million and a net loss of 1293 million after sales of 
assets shugrue said the airlines yield was better than expected 
for august but he declined to give figures 
we made progress he said yeah we lost a little bit of 
money 
he agreed easterns creditors are a little nervous about the 
airlines financial prospects he said easterns spending on 
marketing as well as an estimated 8 million to reconfigure its 
firstclass cabins is an investment in the companys future 
he was appointed to operate eastern not liquidate it he said 
meanwhile relations with easterns unions have deteriorated 
the machinists union whose march 4 1989 strike spurred eastern 
to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection remains on strike 
and pilots and flight attendants unions are unhappy that few of 
their members have gotten their jobs back in the 10 months since 
they ended sympathy walkouts 
it takes two to tango said shugrue who said he wanted to 
negotiate but refused to give in to unrealistic financial demands 
or to bargain away the jobs of 18000 eastern workers who have 
crossed picket lines 
look around this is labor peace shugrue said drawing 
applause from employees 
frank ortis president of the machinists miami local said 
shugrue hadnt live up to his promises 
he in fact went just the opposite way ortis said hes 
continued on lorenzos path 
shugrues meeting with employees was filmed for future 
commercials as was a similar meeting that provided the basis for 
the 100 days blitz 
ortis was critical of the media effort and plans to put leather 
seats airphones new carpeting and other improvements in the 
firstclass section 
they have had a lot of glitz madison avenue and the business 
traveler is still not coming back theyre still losing between 1 
million and 3 million every day said ortis who pinned the 
companys hopes on a merger or takeover by another airline 
shugrue said there have been contacts with other airlines but 
he said there was no major activity to report and his focus is on 
making eastern viable independently 
he said the improvements in firstclass travel wasnt a gimmick 
but a fundamental change in marketing strategy after earlier 
discounted firstclass fares

the guy who rents michael milken a car in 
washington wants a federal judge to know that the financial felon 
cares about the little guy and he always rides a sedan never a 
limo and pays his bills on time 
cbs inc chief executive laurence tisch considers milken a 
person of high integrity whose criminal offenses belie his 
character ordinary citizen jb spence of miami disagrees he says 
milken is a vicious criminal and thief 
friends colleagues and strangers have barraged us district 
judge kimba a wood with about 300 letters appraising the former 
drexel burnham lambert inc junk bond executive and offering ideas 
for his sentence 
the sixinch thick file is replete with testimonials that 
portray milken in a way few news reports of his illegal conduct 
have caring family man devoted philanthropist humble achiever 
and driven but honest professional 
he is not a man given to pomp or materialsm wrote samantha 
grier a social worker who said milken visited her ailing father in 
the hospital he is a man who uses a bic pen as he works toward 
creating his vision of a better world 
a handful of letters all from people who dont know milken 
personally are less flattering one man was upset because milken 
was seen on television smiling as he entered federal court in april 
to enter his guilty plea 
i think he should languish in prison for at least 10 years 
wrote claude daughtry 72 of berkeley calif it will give him 
plenty of time to rethink his scruples 
milken faces up to 28 years in prison when he appears before 
judge wood on oct 1 he pleaded guilty to six felonies involving 
violations of tax and securities laws after a dogged fouryear 
government investigation 
those writing favorable letters urged leniency for milken 
recommending some form of community service rather than prison 
time most judges in recent wall street fraud cases have ordered 
time as a deterrent to future crimes 
presentencing letters often are written at defense lawyers 
urging and the role the letters play in sentencing is up to the 
judge but they can be considered a measure of support in 
comparison to milkens 300 letters inside trader ivan boesky was 
the subject of just 21 presentencing letters 
the roster of letterwriters urging leniency for milken includes 
time warner inc chairman steven j ross armand hammer chairman 
of occidental petroleum corp former lets make a deal host 
and milken friend monty hall exfootball players rosey grier and 
fran tarkenton the chief of the los angeles police department 
takeover lawyers and milkens old competitors and educators from a 
harlem high school to the university of california at berkeleys 
business school who praised milkens wide educational activities 
some sought to distance milken from other felons such as boesky 
who swapped suitcases of cash for information and is widely 
regarded as a pariah on wall street 
tisch said milkens success is based on the merit and power of 
his ideas not improper dealings a former drexel associate paul 
s levy said milken is not someone who wantonly and blatantly 
flouted the law 
good people make mistakes he wrote there were no 
offshore accounts bags of cash calls from phone booths or clearly 
identifiable aggrieved victims michael is not a pied piper of 
greed and lawlessness 
wall street lawyer joseph h flom said that while he didnt 
condone the acts to which milken pleaded guilty i can only 
assume that they were the result of his preoccupation with his 
clients interests 
hammer proclaimed that milken through his junk bond revolution 
that helped raise billions for corporations including occidental 
led the charge which helped to assure that american democracy 
could thrive 
others are more personal friends and former secretaries recall 
milken delivering flowers after a family crisis attending company 
picnics buying candy for their children at the movies and tutoring 
disadvantaged children on saturday mornings at mikes math club 
the car dealer douglas grimes said milken was his only client 
who immediately called his california home listened happily to a 
tape of grimes original music and would always make a point to 
ask how the business was going 
one writer said part of milkens penalties should be used to 
build an industrial exhibition village another said milken 
should be sentenced to help the soviet union hungary or poland 
reshape their economies while living there others said milken 
should develop programs to finance lowincome housing or feed the 
hungry 
alfred avins an administrator at northern virginia law school 
asked the judge to sentence milken to law school at his 
institution on weekends for four years 
i believe that this will do more to rehabilitate mr milken 
than any form of incarceration avins wrote

banking executives shrugged off a barrage of 
negative reports on their industry tuesday pronouncing the 
business sound but adding that it could be in better shape if 
congress relaxes restrictions on the kinds of products the banks 
can sell 
the commercial banking industry is healthy strong enough to 
weather a tougher economic climate in the 1990s said michael p 
esposito chief financial officer of chase manhattan corp at a 
news conference held by the american bankers association 
esposito noted that the banking industry had almost 26 billion 
in profits last year while the savings and loan industry lost more 
than 19 billion he also said the threat to the banks by 
potentially uncollectable loans to third world nations had 
diminished now that the banks have added billions of dollars to 
their reserves for such loans 
the bankers were on the defensive following a string of downbeat 
assessments of the industry 
the latest was a report by the general accounting office issued 
tuesday that said the federal deposit insurance corp which 
insures deposits at the nations banks could be wiped out by 
losses banks are suffering from declining real estate values and 
risky investments 
the gao the auditing arm of congress said at least 35 of the 
nations 200 largest banks are likely to fail or require assistance 
over the next year at a cost to the government of 44 billion to 
63 billion the fdic already faces losses of 2 billion this 
year in addition to losses of 51 billion in 1988 and 1989 the 
gao said 
a 13 billion fund balance could be eliminated by the costs 
related to one or more large money center banks with assets of 130 
billion said comptroller general charles a bowsher who directs 
the gao while im not saying that any money center banks are 
currently in danger of failing this demonstrates the vulnerability 
of the fund 
but esposito said he doubted the fdic would run into trouble 
largely because the premiums banks pay into the fund have gone up 
he conceded there are going to be swings and cycles but 
said the abas economists have drawn up projections that show the 
fund will increase over time 
tuesdays gao report came on the heels of an fdic announcement 
friday that nationwide commercial banks profits fell 24 percent 
during the second quarter the performance of banks in the midwest 
south and west improved during the period but loan problems 
increased in the northeast and southeast the fdic said 
the bankers noted the industry has problem areas including the 
northeast and they said us banks are becoming less competitive 
with foreign banks 
their proposed solution to the latter problem is for congress to 
allow banks to sell securities mutual funds insurance and other 
products that are now offlimits to the industry 
the bankers used tuesdays news conference to call once again 
for changes in the glasssteagall and bank holding company acts 
that regulate the businesses that commercial banks may be involved 
in 
the rules the banking industry has to live with place us at a 
disadvantage with foreign banks and nonbanking lenders like 
general motors acceptance corp said esposito 
gmac which is owned by general motors corp finances loans and 
mortgages for cars trucks homes and other properties

workers in the british north sea oil and gas 
industry said they planned to strike installations in one sector 
for 24 hours beginning wednesday morning 
ronnie mcdonald of the offshore industries liaison committee 
predicted 1500 men would participate in the action starting at 7 
am 
workers rejected any further job actions in a ballot conducted 
by shell uk ltd in the brent field mcdonald said 
he said the strike would be limited to the southern sector 
gasfields a total work stoppage throughout the british north sea 
would affect 10000 workers on 100 platforms 
the strikers who want recognition of unions and higher safety 
standards brought work to a halt on a number of installations 
throughout august they protested the alleged refusal of the 
employers in the offshore contractors council to organize a ballot 
on union recognition and the refusal to reinstate 1500 workers who 
were fired for striking 
a council spokesman said another strike would mean more firings 
safety has been a concern following a number of accidents in the 
british north sea the area suffered the worlds worst oil platform 
disaster in july 1988 when an explosion and fire killed 167 men 
a helicopter crash which killed six oil workers on july 25 was 
the latest in a string of aircraft accidents in the oilfields over 
the past four years

out on the floor i only hope that we can get it to the floor 
a spokesman for dingell declined to comment foley aides did not 
immediately return a phone call 
boxer introduced a bill monday identical to pending senate 
legislation that would require automakers to boost fuel efficiency 
20 percent by 1995 and 40 percent by 2001 
the bill is expected to reach the senate floor this week but a 
spokeswoman for majority leader george mitchell said the timetable 
was uncertain because of other pressing business 
the auto industry stepped up its attack on the bill saying it 
would cost up to 300000 jobs and deprive consumers of such popular 
family vehicles as station wagons and minivans 
if the bill were enacted into law wed have economic disaster 
on our hands said tom hanna president of the motor vehicle 
manufacturers association which represents the big three us 
automakers 
representatives of foreign car manufacturers and us auto 
dealers also criticized the bill at a news conference the groups 
are sponsoring newspaper and radio advertisements in hopes of 
inspiring grassroots opposition 
the united auto workers union was mailing 40000 letters to 
capitol hill urging the bills defeat the bush administration 
opposes it 
current law sets the minimum corporate average fuel economy 
or cafe at 275 miles per gallon the law requires that each new 
car fleet all the cars a company manufactures in a given year 
meet that standard 
under the legislation the typical new car fleet would average 
344 miles per gallon in 1995 and 402 mpg by 2001 
proponents have sought tougher standards for years without 
success but they say momentum has swung their way since iraqs 
invasion of kuwait focused attention on the nations reliance on 
middle eastern oil 
in a letter to foley boxer and 12 other house members said 
it is critical that the house speak out strongly in support of 
efforts to promote efficiency and conservation 
it said we are seeking a commitment that the house have an 
opportunity to vote on the bryan bill or another auto efficiency 
bill before the end of the session 
the proposed cafe standards could save 28 million gallons of 
oil per day nearly onethird of the nations daily consumption of 
imported oil the letter said 
it also contended there was no technological barrier to 
meeting these higher standards indeed automobile industry 
executives admit that a 50 mpg standard is feasible 
automakers insist the only way to meet the proposed standards is 
to reduce drastically the size of new cars all available 
fuelefficiency technology already is being utilized and efforts to 
improve are continuing they said 
fuel costs determine energy efficiency hanna said if the price 
is down consumers want larger cars and manufacturers meet the 
demand if the price rises demand for smaller cars rises

national contract talks between the united auto 
workers and general motors corp continued tuesday after a union 
executive told local leaders to prepare the troops for a strike 
negotiators were working against a midnight friday deadline to 
reach a national contract covering about 300000 active gm workers 
uaw contracts with ford motor co and chrysler corp also expire at 
the same time but the union has chosen gm as its target for a 
strike 
in all more than 450000 active auto workers are covered by uaw 
contracts with the big three automakers 
the unions main bargaining goal is job security and a union 
telephone recording said tuesday that little progress had been made 
on that issue 
the corporation must become more serious in their attitude 
said uaw vice president stephen yokich in charge of the unions gm 
bargaining team he told local union leaders they should be ready 
for a strike 
i trust that you will do everything necessary to prepare the 
membership for a disciplined response to whatever action is 
required in the difficult days ahead yokich said 
the last time the uaw struck gm over a national contract was in 
1984 when the union staged a weeklong walkout at 12 assembly 
plants and the companys technical center in warren mich 
this year members of uaw local 659 at gms ac rochester west 
component plant in flint staged a sixday strike that shut down 
seven assembly plants and parts of more than a dozen component 
factories 
we havent heard hardly anything said uaw local 662 vice 
president larry howerton of anderson ind were going to have to 
hear something pretty soon weve got to be notified 
there has been little news coming out of the talks this year 
uaw and gm officials have been available to media only occasionally 
and when they have appeared they rarely talked about contract 
details they have preferred instead to say both sides were working 
hard and there still was time to reach an agreement before the 
deadline 
so far union officials have said tentative agreements have been 
reached on nearly all noneconomic issues such as military leave 
and jury duty provisions but the economic issues which include 
job security are the tough ones 
the uaw leadership has a strong strike authorization vote under 
its belt clearing the way for it to call a strike against gm if an 
agreement cannot be reached

the last time the united auto workers bargained a 
pattern national contract with general motors corp tensions were 
high and a weeklong strike resulted 
with three days left in this years bargaining the stress isnt 
as noticeable as it was in 1984 and some even feel the unions 
position has been strengthened since the last big strike 
i feel that we are more on the offense than on the defense 
now said larry howerton vice president of local 662 in 
anderson ind it seems like we were trying in 1984 to hold 
everything we got and now were trying to get what we want 
but one basic fact underlies the process this time around and 
it has the attention of both sides thats the loss of market share 
to the japanese 
youre dealing with some very fundamental things here auto 
analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman brothers said tuesday 
in past years including 1984 negotiating arguments centered on 
a percent or two in wages or on how financial guarantees for 
laidoff workers would work 
these days the issues and especially their potential effects 
are much deeper and according to phillippi its mostly due to the 
growth of the us manufacturing base by japanese automakers 
during the 1980s the big three watched their collective share 
of the us auto market drop 6 percentage points to about 68 
percent while the share of cars with japanese nameplates increased 
about 6 points to 254 percent 
its become abundantly clear that we us automakers are 
unable to pry people out of their nissans hondas or toyotas and 
get them to buy american products phillippi said weve tried 
cash japanbashing you name it and it hasnt worked 
any rightthinking individual has got to be really really 
concerned he said 
because of that concern phillippi suggested negotiators arent 
talking outside bargaining meetings 
the people are under wraps uaw local 160 president pete 
kelly a member of the unions 1984 bargaining committee there 
is nobody down there who is going to buck the hierarchy of the 
uaw 
auto labor observers have said this years talks have been 
remarkably lacking in public details officially union and company 
officials say that indicates both sides are hard at work toiling 
against a midnight friday deadline 
uaw contracts with gm ford motor co and chrysler corp 
covering more than 450000 active workers expire at the same time 
late last month the union chose to focus its bargaining at gm 
the union plans to use a contract ratified by gm workers as a 
pattern for agreements with ford and chrysler it is expected to 
take about two weeks for uaw members to vote on any tentative 
agreement 
in 1984 the union picked dual targets ford and gm with less 
than a week remaining in the bargaining the uaw targeted gm then 
and now the main issue was job security 
but unlike this round of bargaining tensions were much higher 
six years ago perhaps because of lingering anger over a series of 
concession contracts the union signed a few years earlier with the 
big three at the time the automakers were in the financial dumps 
as the final minutes ticked off of the bargaining clock in 1984 
the uaw leadership couldnt hold its membership workers began 
walking off their jobs before the midnight deadline 
by the time uaw president owen bieber announced a strike at 12 
gm assembly plants and its technical center in warren mich 
employees already were walking picket lines 
the following day not enough workers showed up at their jobs at 
gms lordstown ohio assembly plant which was not officially 
struck and that factory shut down 
the strike lasted for seven days and the union bragged that it 
had won major guarantees on job security and important wage and 
benefit gains three years later the union said it built on the 
job security provisions of 1984 
but since 1987 gm has closed four assembly plants putting 
about 9000 uaw members on layoff

members of the united steelworkers union 
overwhelmingly approved a new contract with wheelingpittsburgh 
steel corp on tuesday clearing a major hurdle in the companys 
attempt to reorganize 
jim bowen usw district 23 director said 4615 steelworkers 
voted in favor of the pact with 329 workers against it a simple 
majority was needed to approve the pact which expires in march 
1994 
this is the very climax of what i think will be a very 
important process for wheelingpittsburgh steel and our union 
bowen said i think these numbers reflect the confidence the 
workers have in their union 
leaders from all 13 wheelingpitt locals urged their members to 
vote for the pact which affects 5500 union workers in west 
virginia pennsylvania and ohio 
i learned a long time ago that if you ever get everything you 
asked for you didnt ask for enough to start with said bowen 
we asked for plenty and ill tell you i think we got our fair 
share of it 
ray johnson a wheelingpitt spokesman said company officials 
were surprised by the lopsided tally 
we did expect a very good vote for it but this was 
overwhelming he said 
bowen said the vote opens the door for wheelingpitt officials 
to file an amended reorganization plan with us bankruptcy judge 
warren bentz in pittsburgh 
the lawyers and accountants ought to quit playing their 
games said bowen they got their labor agreement its been 
confirmed now i say to the judge and all the rest of them its 
time to get this over with 
wheelingpitt has been operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection since april 1985 
bentz still must review the labor agreement johnson said an 
amended reorganization plan will be voted on by creditors 
shareholders and all wheelingpitt employees 
he said it will likely be another two months before an amended 
reorganization plan incorporating the new contract is confirmed by 
the bankruptcy court 
the contract includes a wage increase of 150 per hour which 
would restore wages sacrificed earlier and a 3000 signing bonus 
for each union worker 
the company also agreed to give the steelworkers 22 million 
shares of stock worth 22 million and a cash payment of 38 million 
in return for wage concessions made in 1982 and 1985

the head of the american stock exchange said 
tuesday that he expects the globalization of securities markets in 
the 1990s will lead to a shakeout among smaller exchanges in this 
country 
i would be very suprised to see more than three significant 
marketplaces survive the 1990s amex chairman james r jones told 
the national economists club 
jones a former oklahoma congressman also said he expected only 
one of those three survivors to trade solely through electronic 
methods 
currently the amex and the larger new york stock exchange trade 
through the inperson auction system between buyers and sellers 
the 14 smaller exchanges are linked to the larger new york 
exchanges to facilitate transactions 
i think for most of the regional exchanges theyre going to 
have a very difficult time in the 1990s and i think at the very 
least there will be joint ventures with the larger exchanges 
jones told reporters after giving a talk on the united states role 
in the stock markets of the 1990s 
i dont know how exactly its going to come out he said 
i think its going to be very hard for some of the smaller 
regional exchanges to compete to have the capital needed for new 
technology etc etc so i think youll either see mergers or 
perhaps joint ventures 
just back from meetings of the international stock exchange 
association in frankfurt and berlin jones said the united states 
also will have to liberalize its securities laws 
were going to have to revisit our own securities laws and ask 
if were going to make them so rigid that they would not be 
competitive in the world market he said 
jones also said it would be a mistake to impose a tax on 
securities transactions a revenueraising plan said to be under 
consideration by budget negotiators when other countries are 
lowering or eliminating theirs 
he noted that options trading moved from sweden to london after 
the swedish government imposed a transaction tax 
a transaction tax would make us noncompetitive he said

the resolution trust corp on tuesday offered 
for sale on the open market part of its portfolio of highrisk junk 
bonds a spokeswoman for the agency said 
we have been selling junk bonds spokeswoman kate spears 
said she declined to provide any details 
but bond traders said the rtc sold about 70 million of junk 
bonds nearly the full amount it had intended to sell 
they traded very well said steve shenfeld a trader at 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp in new york 
two of the issues the rtc sold golden nugget and mccaw 
cellular together accounted for some 25 million said market 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity other issues sold by 
the agency included eastern airlines penn traffic and telemundo 
group 
the rtc the federal agency set up to dispose of failed savings 
and loans has around 29 billion of the highrisk highyield 
junk bonds which it took over from the collapsed thrifts the 
oncethriving junk bond market has been cited as a factor in the 
failure of some sampls that invested heavily in the bonds and took 
losses when the market weakened 
the implications of what happened today are a positive said 
joseph c bencivenga the head of highyield research at salomon 
brothers inc in new york it shows that the market is not dead 
and investors are willing to pay for issues they consider to have 
value 
traders said they expect the rtc which also sold junk bonds 
last week to offer more of the issues for sale later this week 
they will be in the market at various times over many many 
months shenfeld said in general i think the rtcs portfolio 
will eventually find a home 
on monday federal regulators announced they had blocked the 
proposed 3 billion sale by columbia savings amp loan association of 
its junk bonds to a group of canadian and hong kong investors 
the office of thrift supervision said it cannot approve the sale 
in its current form because columbia neglected to seek an adequate 
number of bids for the junk bond portfolio columbia a troubled 
thrift based in beverly hills calif failed to seek any allcash 
bids as part of the bidding process the ots said 
columbia at one time had the thrift industrys largest portfolio 
of junk bonds 
regulators have held off seizing columbia while its managers 
tried to find a buyer for the junk bonds despite the fact that the 
thrift is insolvent columbia was 350 million in the red according 
to the latest report largely due to the declining value of the 
junk bond portfolio but also because of recent real estate losses 
analysts have suggested that the regulators may be reluctant to 
take over columbia because they dont want the government to have 
the junk bonds on its hands

motorola inc announced an agreement tuesday with 
siemens ag a west german electronics manufacturer to 
crosslicense each others essential patents for a paneuropean 
digital cellular telephone network 
the agreement also covers technology for a proposed european 
personal communications network a type of cellular phone system in 
which many more users would be able to gain access to the phone 
network at once and phone costs would be much lower than with 
todays cellular systems

motorola and the dutch communications company alcatel nv also 
designed to help clear the way for development of the proposed 
cellular phone network based on a single standard throughout europe 
the companies each are supplying part of the network and need 
the crosslicensing agreements to complete the system said mario 
salvadori a motorola spokesman 
bernard smedley a motorola senior vice president said the 
agreements with european manufacturers demonstrate that the 
appropriate forum for resolving intellectual property rights issues 
is among manufacturers through fair bilateral negotiations 
terms of the licensing agreements were not disclosed 
motorola based in suburban schaumburg has been awarded 
contracts to build digital cellular systems in several european 
countries it also is a minority owner of mercury personal

its no secret that the oil futures market loves 
a good rumor but the mill has been working overtime since the iraq 
invasion of kuwait 
somebody on the floor will say we heard this this and that 
and people will start trading pretty quickly said annlouise 
hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
i think this is a very unusual situation because were in 
an uncertain situation in the middle east 
with most petroleum prices keying off futures the gossip game 
can eventually have an impact far beyond the trading floors these 
days consumers fill their cars with gasoline or stock up on home 
heating oil that costs more money thanks in large measure to what 
happened on the new york mercantile exchange 
sure rumors can ultimately affect the consumer said art 
wiese spokesman for the american petroleum institute gauging the 
impact would be hard however 
youd have to be able to determine fairly specifically what 
the impact of the rumor was versus all the other things going on 
in the market all day wiese said 
executives of the merc view any trading based on rumors as a 
momentary aberration according to neal l wolkoff senior vice 
president for regulatory affairs and operations 
i would think that a market move of an hour would tend to be 
corrected fairly quickly and would have a minimum impact on 
peoples pocket books wolkoff said in an interview tuesday 
but the price paid for current delivery of oil largely reflects 
the price established in the futures market 
speculation on contracts for future delivery of petroleum 
products has virtually eliminated longterm pricing in the 
industry forcing oil buyers to pay a price similar to the latest 
merc price 
the effects of the grapevine were apparent monday when lower 
oil prices were suddenly pushed higher late in the afternoon on 
rumors that iraq had either amassed troops on the jordanian border 
or even sent troops into jordan 
there were also rumors that iraqi paratroopers had attacked 
saudi arabian oilfields or that shooting had broken out in the 
military standoff 
exchange officials said tuesday they were looking into what 
happened to determine whether any rumor was spread with an intent 
to influence prices 
were trying to investigate wolkoff said its obviously 
very difficult to get to the source of a story that gets started 
then somehow gets repeated then somehow gets adopted 
the merc would not hesitate to discipline anyone trying to 
manipulate the market through rumors or even to turn them in to 
the justice department wolkoff said 
as much as merc managers dislike floor rumors they have been 
around since the exchange began trading oil in 1983 
in the 80s there were occasional rumors of the ayatollahs 
death wolkoff said referring to past iranian crises there 
were rumors that the president president reagan died these 
things affected the markets across the board the rumors of the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death perhaps had more impact than 
his death 
the latest oil crisis has seen more than just mondays rumors a 
little more than a week earlier oil markets in asia were sent 
tumbling by rumors that iraqi president saddam hussein had lost 
power that rumor had its own brief effects on the us markets 
first i believe it was that there had been a coup and then 
someone said he had been killed and thats how the rumor 
started said ed kevelson a trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc it affected asia and it somewhat affected our opening here 
but by the time it got here it had been discounted

oil prices settled lower tuesday after swinging 
nervously during the day in response to shifting news from the 
middle east 
its really a very very uncertain and skittish market said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
light sweet crude oil for october delivery settled 54 cents 
lower at 3076 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
contracts for later months were also down 
in early trading oil fell as markets realized the rumors that 
sparked a rally on monday were untrue but news later tuesday 
indicated iraq was increasing its military activities near syria 
and turkey and oil shot back up 
it dropped as traders began taking profits and developing a 
sense that the price needed to move downward 
its difficult to come up with a reason in a market like 
this hittle said its getting skittish on its own 
other petroleum futures traded on the merc were generally down 
unleaded gasoline for october fell 112 cents to 9360 cents per 
gallon while later contracts were mostly down home heating oil 
for october fell 286 cents to 8303 cents per gallon and later 
months were also down 
natural gas for october was unchanged at 1525 per 1000 cubic 
feet 
trader ed kevelson of dean witter reynolds inc said heating oil 
took the biggest fall in anticipation that american petroleum 
institute statistics released after the market closed would show an 
increased stockpile of distillates which include heating oil 
according to the api report distillate stocks rose from 1267 
million barrels to 1317 million barrels for the week ending sept 
7 while distillate production and imports were down the stockpile 
of distillates had been 1198 million barrels a year earlier api 
said 
crude oil imports for the week rose to 69 million barrels per 
day from 68 million barrels while crude stocks were up to 3743 
million barrels from 3722 million barrels a year earlier crude 
imports had been running at 65 million barrels per day while the 
stockpile had been 3386 million barrels 
gasoline stocks stood at 2111 million barrels up from 2105 
million barrels a week earlier but down from 2184 million barrels 
a year earlier gasoline imports rose to 261000 barrels per day 
from 192000 barrels a week earlier but were down from 272000 
barrels a year earlier 
meanwhile prices at the pump were up 
the american automobile association reported a gallon of 
selfserve regular unleaded rose 21 cents to 1294 per gallon 
nationwide since last wednesday the average retail price was 219 
cents higher than aug 1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait and 
sent oil markets into a state of chaos

the new york stock exchange on tuesday approved 
two stages of its plan to implement 24hour trading by the end of 
the decade 
approved were two trading periods called crossing sessions 
that would allow completion of trades after hours 
the nyse board also approved a series of rules for trading after 
the exchanges regular hours of 930 am to 4 pm 
big board president richard a grasso said the plan reflects 
the nyses commitment to innovative services for its customers and 
positions the exchange competitively in the evolution of the 
24hour marketplace 
nyse chairman john j phelan jr unveiled the extended trading 
plan earlier this year in response to increasing competition from 
other markets 
the first stage of the exchanges fivepart plan was introduced 
aug 3 permitting some late trades at the market closing price for 
orders already in place 
the two afterhours trading sessions approved tuesday would be 
instituted pending approval of the securities and exchange 
commission 
the first session would run from 415 to 5 pm and permit 
trading at the markets closing price all orders placed during 
this session would be matched up and executed at 5 pm 
the second session running from 415 pm to 515 pm would 
allow traders to execute computerized program trades based on 
aggregate prices tied to a market index 
the nyse said the fourth phase of its plan targeted for 1991 
would allow auctions several times during the night of all listed 
securities the fifth phase would provide for conventional trading 
round the clock 
phelan has said 24hour trading is planned for the end of the 
decade but other officials have said it could be in place within 
five years 
roundtheclock trading now exists in the foreign currency and

airline passengers bumped from overbooked 
flights can turn down the free tickets and refunds theyre offered 
and sue for damages a federal appeals court ruled tuesday 
in a case from montana a threejudge panel of the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals said a federal ban on direct state 
regulation of airlines does not prevent a passenger from suing 
under ordinary state law for harm caused by airline practices 
the ruling allows william d west a helena mont patent 
lawyer to pursue a suit against northwest airlines for selling 
tickets that cannot be exchanged or refunded but are subject to 
bumping when flights are overbooked west is seeking punitive 
damages 
selling nonrefundable tickets limits a travelers ability to 
make changes but not the airlines ability to switch to a 
smallersize aircraft increasing the chances of bumping said 
attorney cornish hitchcock of the public citizen litigation group 
a ralph nader organization that helped represent west 
the right to sue for overbooking was established in a 1976 
supreme court decision a case that started when allegheny airlines 
bumped nader from a washingtontohartford flight in tuesdays 
ruling the appeals court said the federal deregulation of airlines 
in 1978 did not prohibit all such suits 
the airline was studying the ruling tuesday and had no comment 
said its lawyer jon metropoulos 
hitchcock said wests case was unusual because it holds the 
possibility of sizable damages if the airline is found to have 
acted in bad faith under montana law 
many airlines offer freetrip coupons to passengers on 
overbooked flights federal law also entitles a bumped passenger to 
a refund of the ticket price up to 200 if a substitute flight is 
more than an hour later than the original flight or twice those 
amounts if more than two hours late hitchcock said the typical 
traveler probably should take one of those options rather than sue 
we generally recommend that people take the money or take the 
free ticket as a quick and easy way of resolving the matter he 
said the litigation can drag on for some time and theres no 
guarantee of recovery 
west was bumped from a northwest flight from great falls mont 
to arlington va in september 1986 when the airline switched from 
a 146passenger plane to a 78passenger plane without warning 
ticket agents west who had been scheduled to land in arlington at 
9 pm turned down an alternative flight to a nearby airport at 3 
am and instead rescheduled his trip two weeks later 
his suit under montana law for badfaith dealing by the airline 
was dismissed by us district judge charles lovell which said it 
was barred by federal law but the appeals court disagreed 
the 1978 federal airline deregulation law which prohibited 
state laws relating to rates routes or services of any air 
carrier bars only those state laws that purport to regulate 
airlines said judge dorothy nelson in the 30 ruling 
state laws that merely have an effect on airline services are 
not preempted nelson said she said one such law was the 
montana statute invoked by west requiring goodfaith conduct 
between buyers and sellers or any other parties in a contract 
the court said it was not deciding whether west had a valid 
claim under that law only that he had a right to sue

defense attorneys tuesday mimicked the frenzied 
action in the chicago mercantile exchanges japanese yen pit as 
opening arguments began in the trial of 14 currency traders accused 
of cheating customers 
attorneys ed genson and joseph duffy the first to make their 
opening statements before us district judge william t hart 
imitated the rapid calls and hand signals of the pit they 
described the noise and stress caused by about 100 traders 
competing for currency futures contracts every business day 
they also questioned the worth as evidence of surreptitious 
tapes made by undercover fbi agent dieter volk who posed as a 
corrupt trader as part of a sting investigation at the worlds two 
largest futures exchanges 
the pit is not a quiet whispery place said genson 
attorney for independent yen trader robert bailin 36 
his comment was a challenge to the opening statement of 
assistant us attorney lisa huestes 
you will be hearing about whispered conversation after 
whispered conversation huestes told the jurors earlier tuesday 
huestes said the government would try to show systematic 
collusion between brokers and independent or local yen 
traders to defraud the brokers customers often through locals 
agreeing to buy brokers erroneous contracts in exchange for 
trading favors she said the motivation was plain and simple 
greed 
duffy defense attorney for john m baker 51 said many of the 
tapes volk made of baker were made in a bar where volk often 
bought beers for the broker 
the fbi recorded the musings of a drunk thats not credible 
evidence he said 
the charges resulted from an unprecedented undercover 
investigation in which fbi agents posed as corrupt traders they 
secretly taperecorded conversations among traders at the two 
commodity exchanges 
a federal grand jury indicted 48 people in the probe twenty 
have pleaded guilty and one pleaded no contest 
in the first trial resulting from the investigation a us 
district court jury in july convicted two swiss franc traders of 
relatively minor trading violations and acquitted a third 
the jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious 
charges including a racketeering count against one of the three 
defendants the men are to be tried again on those charges early 
next year
