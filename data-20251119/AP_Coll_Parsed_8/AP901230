charges of importing and distributing cocaine in the united states 
the government of guatemala acted rapidly to detain these 
individuals the embassy said referring to the arrests thursday

two army deserters who hijacked an 
airliner and held dozens of hostages during a twoday standoff 
surrendered sunday after freeing all passengers and crew the 
official algerian news agency reported 
the hijackers were taken into custody without violence after 
releasing the pilot and copilot of the stateowned air algerie 
boeing 737 the news agency said earlier 46 remaining passengers 
were freed 
there were no reports of injuries 
the hijackers names were not immediately released by 
authorities and the motive for the incident was unclear the aps 
news agency reported the men were deserters from the saharan town 
of ghardaia where the flight began late friday 
the hijackers who were armed had demanded 20 hours worth of 
fuel to fly to another country 
the jet carrying 82 passengers and six crew members was forced 
to land in the eastern city of annaba early saturday after 
officials in carthage tunisia turned the flight away 
egyptian officials refused saturday to allow the hijackers to 
fly there 
the hijackers seized the aircraft shortly after takeoff from 
ghardaia a popular winter resort it was bound for the algerian 
capital of algiers 
according to airline officials and accounts by freed passengers 
the pair produced a pistol and submachine gun shortly after 
takeoff one hijacker took control of the cabin and the other 
watched over the passengers forcing the women to the front of the 
plane 
the plane started rolling but not like an air pocket 
french passenger paulette thibule 67 told the french television 
network la cinq the stewardesses got moving toward the front 
thats when i understood there was a struggle in the cockpit 
talks with the hijackers resumed at dawn sunday 
interior minister mohammad saleh mohammedi first negotiated the 
release of the remaining people on board a short while later he 
persuaded the two men to surrender witnesses said the hijackers 
gave up after freeing the pilot and copilot 
police had surrounded the plane although other flights took off 
and landed at the airport about 250 miles east of algiers 
on saturday the two hijackers released 36 passengers mostly 
children elderly people and foreigners 
air algerie said there were 14 foreign nationals among the 
passengers kahlouche said the foreigners included french german 
italian and japanese citizens 
the state department said no americans were on the flight 
late saturday there were conflicting reports about the 
hijackers 
transport minister hassan kahlouche said the hijackers were 
algerian and made no political statements or demands 
but an algerian official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the hijackers probably were islamic fundamentalists protesting 
a crackdown against an allied moslem movement in tunisia 
algeria is home to north africas most powerful islamic 
fundamentalist movement which took a majority of seats in local 
and municipal elections in june 
another algerian official quoted freed passengers as saying the 
hijackers showed no physical or verbal violent intentions and 
made no statements about their motives 
algeria has long experience in negotiating the release of 
hostages most recently in april 1988 when mediators won the 
freedom of 31 hostages aboard a hijacked kuwait airways jet 
western officials criticized algeria for releasing the 
hijackers who killed two people 
algerian diplomats played a key role in winning the 1981 release 
of americans held hostage at the us embassy in iran they also 
brokered the release of many western hostages in lebanon

mayor david dinkins reflecting on his first 
year in office says hes proud that he maintained the citys bond 
rating despite a budget deficit 
but the citys first black mayor said he wishes he could have 
spent less time dealing with fiscal problems and more time on the 
social issues that propelled him into office 
i look forward to the day when we will be able to move ahead 
on some of the dreams that have been for the moment at least 
deferred dinkins said during a recent interview 
a projected gap of at least 250 million in the citys 1991 
fiscal year budget has forced the mayor to cut funds in virtually 
every area from education and street cleaning to libraries and 
bridge repair 
according to a federal report released the week before 
christmas the new york metropolitan region lost an estimated 
100000 jobs in private industry in 1990 half of them in new york 
city 
the fiscal crisis has made it difficult for dinkins to devote 
time to the citys poor and young whose plight he promised to 
improve during his campaign for mayor 
dinkins acknowledged that his inability to focus on social 
issues has made some of his strongest supporters impatient for 
results 
a recent new york newsday poll showed that only 33 percent of 
those interviewed approved of his job performance down from 53 
percent in june the biggest decline in approval came among blacks 
still largely supportive of him but down to 65 percent from 76 
percent and manhattan residents 
dinkins said the high points of his first year included 
antiapartheid leader nelson mandelas visit a decision by the 
democratic party to hold its 1992 convention here and his city 
hall speech calling for racial harmony as new yorkers awaited a 
verdict in the first trial in the slaying of a black teenager in a 
mob attack in a predominantly white neighborhood in brooklyn 
while the citys crime rate has soared with annual city murders 
topping 2000 for the first time dinkins said he is proud of his 
safe streets safe city plan to hire thousands of new police 
officers 
but he failed to win the approval of the crime plan by the state 
legislature which recessed two weeks ago without acting on it 
asked about his priorities for 1992 the mayor said he would 
focus first on fiscal stability followed by public safety and then 
education youth services and health care 
there are many more things i had hoped to accomplish 
especially in the areas of human service that just plain require 
money dinkins admitted 
how long dreams continue to be deferred he said will depend on 
when we get some money 
dinkins also said he believed that in general more was expected 
of him than of past mayors not so much because i am an african 
american per se but because the coalition that elected me 
was very dissatisfied in the closing years of the stewardship of 
my predecessor edward koch 
and they saw this as an opportunity for things to be different 
in some particulars and we dont have the ability to change these 
things overnight for a variety of reasons dinkins said and 
especially now as theres the need to cut back and downsize 
its going to be even more difficult and painful

a gangs plot to murder police officers on 
new years eve has been foiled by the arrests of three young men 
and seizure of weapons police said 
the alleged plot apparently was in retaliation for police 
crackdowns on gangcontrolled drug operations in the van nuys and 
sylmar areas of the san fernando valley said lt jim vojtecky 
as early as september we began getting inforamtion that local 
street gangs were getting a little irritated and we had 
indications they were going to attempt to kill a cop because we 
were screwing up their drug operations in the streets vojtecky 
said 
gang violence in the nations secondlargest city reached record 
levels during 1990 as of nov 30 gang violence had accounted for 
315 deaths in 1990 a 124 percent jump over 1989 when 303 people 
died in gang attacks 
vojtecky said tension between police and gangs in the van nuys 
area has been building for months recent information from 
informants convinced police that an attempt to kill police would be 
made on new years eve vojtecky said 
in early morning raids saturday police seized two rifles one 
with a sawedoff barrel one handgun and 163 rounds of ammunition 
sergio camarena cesar reveles and hector aleman all 18 were 
taken into custody camarena and reveles were booked for 
investigation of conspiracy to commit murder and aleman was booked 
for possession of a sawedoff rifle 
the three belonged to the same gang which vojtecky declined to 
identify in keeping with departmental policy designed to avoid 
giving publicity to individual gangs 
vojtecky said officers did not have time to determine how the 
alleged murder plot was to be carried out 
police believe the plot was foiled by the arrests however a 
bulletin was issued advising officers throughout los angeles to be 
careful on new years eve 
saturdays arrests followed by hours a spate of gang violence in 
the region that left a 13yearold boy dead and a girl critically 
wounded 
the 13yearold boy was shot while sleeping in the living room 
of his grandmothers home in suburban pomona police said the 
gunman apparently mistook the youth visiting from claremont for a 
member of a local gang 
the girl was shot in the head when several rounds were fired 
through the living room window of her home in southwest los 
angeles the 13yearold was listed in very critical condition at 
cedarsinai medical center 
police lt joe germain said investigators suspect it was gang 
gunfire but did not know if the girl was the intended victim

the communist party on sunday adopted a cautious 
economic and social blueprint for the 1990s stressing stability 
and selfreliance and rejecting the infatuation with rapid reform 
of the 1980s 
we must guard against and overcome the tendency of being 
impatient for success and strive to avoid a recurrence of big ups 
and downs in economic life the ruling partys central committee 
said in a communique adopted at a closeddoor sixday meeting that 
ended sunday 
the evening television news showed party general secretary jiang 
zemin in a dark gray mao suit presiding over the opening session in 
the great hall of the people with 171 full members and 107 
alternates in attendance along with several hundred retired party 
elders 
neither jiangs opening speech nor the comments of any 
individual members were released 
the meeting was postponed for weeks as committee members argued 
over drafts of new five and tenyear plans to take effect on new 
years day and guide chinas centrally planned economy into the 
21st century 
the official xinhua news agencys report of the session 
indicated the committee did not approve any existing drafts 
instead xinhua said the government will now map out the plans 
presumably based on the central committee communique 
the blueprint gives priority in state spending to agriculture 
basic industries and infrastructure it also calls for more 
attention to national defense which received a shrinking share of 
the budget during the 1980s 
little space is given in the communique to new economic reforms 
that would continue chinas decadeold program of supplementing 
central planning with market forces 
reform was one of the key issues dividing central committee 
members party elders such as 86yearold chen yun who played a 
key role in the early years of reform accused younger liberals of 
forgetting that the reforms were intended to strengthen socialism 
not build capitalism 
private enterprise and free markets should supplement the state 
sector but not replace it he argued 
the conservatives appeared to have won judging from the brevity 
of the references to reform and the repeated calls for 
strengthening the inefficient debtridden stateowned sector 
however a western diplomat cautioned that it is too soon to 
make an assessment the document may have been drafted with a 
conservative slant in order to win passage while containing enough 
references to improving efficiency to allow for real change 
the only sentence that specifically deals with new reforms says 
structural changes are needed in the fields of enterprises 
circulation prices finance taxation banking planning 
investment and labor and wages a broad list no detailed 
suggestions are made 
the communique says economic growth should be sustained and 
stable based on the principle of doing what is within our 
capacity 
no targets were set but premier li peng recently said average 
annual growth of 6 percent would be appropriate down from an 
average of nearly 10 percent during most of the 1980s 
during the 1980s however the economy experienced several 
swings from too rapid expansion and rising inflation to abrupt 
governmentordered slowdowns designed to curb the inflation such 
swings gave china a reputation for economic instability 
the battle between beijing and regional authorities for control 
over tax revenues appears unresolved 
the document says overall regulation and control of the 
economy is needed but concludes evenhandedly it is necessary to 
handle properly the relations between the central and the local 
authorities and give full scope to the initiative of both 
the 1990s will be pivotal years for china says the document 
which alludes only vaguely to the collapse of socialism in many 
other countries 
success or failure in our efforts to greatly promote 
economic growth and social progress will have a direct bearing on 
the rise or fall of chinas socialist system 
we should strengthen ideological and political work in real 
ernest carry out indepth education in patriotism collectivism 
and socialism and reenergize the national spirit 
such calls have become routine since the violent crushing of 
last years massive democracy movement which is not mentioned in 
the communique 
a single sentence says efforts should be made to push forward 
political structural reform and expand socialist democracy but 
there is no mention of any specific reforms 
when reformist fever peaked in 1987 there were calls for 
separating the party and government functions but such ideas have 
been anathema since the conservative backlash to the democracy 
movement

the new year holds promise for hightechnology 
and medical companies despite the deepening economic slump but 
many businesses tied to automobiles and housing face dim prospects 
a government forecast said sunday 
the commerce department in its 32nd annual forecast of winners 
and losers in american business predicted that 110 of 184 
manufacturing industries it surveyed would enjoy rising sales in 
1991 the rest will see no growth or suffer a drop in sales 
the outlook is generally one of continuing but slow growth for 
most sectors of the economy said commerce undersecretary j 
michael farren 
however the departments forecasts are based on an assumption 
that the economy will avoid a recession with a growth in the gross 
national product next year in the lower end of a 1 percent to 3 
percent range nearly all private economists contend the economy 
already is shrinking and will continue to do so at least through 
the first quarter of 1991 with an annual growth in gnp of around 
03 percent next year 
the commerce department report said that overall the median 
growth rate for manufacturing sales is expected to be positive for 
the ninth consecutive year but by a barely perceptible 089 
percent down from an almostasdismal 095 percent this year 
the median rate the point where half of the industries had 
bigger sales increases and half had smaller was far healthier in 
1988 21 percent and 1987 3 percent 
the 560page report us industrial outlook was prepared 
by 130 analysts using information current through august and 
september 
retail sales were projected to rise only 1 or 2 percent after 
inflation next year 
consumeroriented industries are expected to do less well 
overall reflecting the general slowdown in the economy farren 
said such products as furniture appliances and household audio 
and video equipment are expected to decline 
two key sectors of the economy construction and motor vehicles 
were expected to have another bad year in 1991 with their weakness 
spilling over into a variety of related industries 
high vacancy rates in office buildings was expected to depress 
construction by 15 percent while hotel construction was predicted 
to fall 20 percent residential housing construction was expected 
to decline 6 percent from 122 million units to 115 million 
car sales probably will fall from 95 million this year to 93 
million but truck sales likely will rise about 1 percent to 47 
million the report said 
the declines in both construction and motor vehicles will have 
a significant impact on a number of other major industries 
including building materials household durables goods such as 
appliances that are expected to last three or more years steel 
and wood products farren said 
in addition to the manufacturing industries the report also 
evaluated 166 service businesses the fastestgrowing sector of the 
economy however farren cautioned that the performance of services 
was much more difficult to forecast and to compare to previous 
years 
electronic information services computer software and other 
computer services are expected to do the best while slower 
expansion was projected for movie theaters home entertainment and 
legal services 
in manufacturing most of the 10 fastestgrowing industries are 
connected with either health care or hightechnology 
leather tanning and finishing topped the list with 94 percent 
expected growth but that was considered an anomaly largely 
attributed to expected increases in domestic production because of 
new duties imposed on leather imports from argentina 
leather tanning was followed by semiconductors the basic 
building block of computer chips with a projected 89 percent 
increase in sales and surgical instruments up 86 percent others 
in the top 10 were surgical supplies medicines diagnostic 
substances poultry slaughtering and processing biological 
products aircraft and dental equipment 
at the bottom of the scale was creamery butter with a projected 
sales decline of 146 percent the department attributed the drop 
to consumers worry about cholesterol and weight gain 
other shrinking industries were mobile homes frozen baked goods 
except bread boat building motors and generators household 
cooking equipment hardwood and flooring mills electric housewares 
and fans fabricated metal and sawmill and planing mills 
in general the department said industries linked to export 
sales would fare better than businesses tied to the domestic 
economy farren said foreigners will be encouraged to buy us 
goods by the decline in the value of the dollar this year 
however farren conceded that the price of oil driven up by the 
persian gulf crisis likely would keep the us trade deficit 
1094 billion in 1989 at about 105 billion in 1990 as well as 
next year 
the report predicted continued business investment despite the 
slow economy as manufacturers try to keep up with overseas 
competitors and meet new environmental requirements requiring new 
pollutioncontrol equipment

it all many hundreds of years ago 
the question surfaces every 10 years and for many people the 
answer is obvious the new decades began with the 1990s a year ago 
on jan 1 1990 and will end dec 31 1999 
but dont tell that to the calendar purists 
if you refer to the decade of the 90s im willing to concede 
that 1990 is in the 90s its obviously not in the 80s says 
leroy doggett a calendar expert at the us naval observatory 
but he explains that this view of a decade in time is simply a 
colloquialism with no basis in history 
when we talk about the last decade of the 20th century we get 
into a chronological question which forces you to ask when did the 
first century begin he says 
doggett provides this explanation 
the numbering system in our current gregorian calendar indeed 
in all human calendars is arbitrary someone picked a particular 
date or event and started counting from that point there is 
nothing in nature that causes it to be a particular year or for a 
particular day to be new year 
thats where the monk dionysius exiguus or dennis the 
small got into the act nearly 1500 years ago he had been given 
the task of developing a set of tables to help local priests and 
bishops determine the date of easter 
at the time everything was dated from the accession of the 
roman emperor diocletian but diocletian had persecuted the early 
christians and dionysius didnt want to commemorate him in the new 
tables 
instead dionysius based the tables on the date of jesus birth 
which the monk determined had occurred 532 years earlier dionysius 
called the year of jesus birth the year 1 and began the count 
so the first decade was 1 to 10 the second was 11 to 20 
extrapolating from that we end up starting a new decade with 1991 
which runs through 2000 which completes the 20th century so the 
21st century starts with 2001 said doggett 
why didnt dionysius simply call the first year zero and 
avoid all the confusion 
well the number zero was not then in use in the west 
explained doggett counting was done using either roman numerals or 
fingers neither of which includes a zero 
theres more 
many scholars have concluded that dionysius actually 
miscalculated by two to 10 years the actual birth of jesus but by 
the time those questions were raised his numbering system was 
widely used and was not changed 
and the year 1991 is not the only year that makes its debut in 
the coming 12 months the muslim year 1412 begins at sundown next 
july 12 and the jewish year 5752 begins at sundown next sept 8

peu dinda hopping up a hill on one 
leg with rusty crutches says life wont improve for him no matter 
who controls cambodia 
he is one of the thousands to have lost a part of themselves 
during cambodias 20yearold civil war in this southeast asian 
country where most people work two or even three jobs to survive 
the former soldier cant find any job at all 
without any formal education he said his only hope is manual 
labor but with only one leg he fears thats an impossibility 
its difficult to tell the future said peu dinda who 
survives on a meager government war stipend 
such feelings of hopelessness grip many cambodians since 
gaining independence from the french in 1954 this country has 
struggled to survive american bombings a superpowersponsored 
civil war a khmer rouge genocide and an 11year vietnamese 
occupation 
promises of peace and prosperity with the next government are 
greeted with wariness and weariness 
world leaders have called a peace settlement by cambodias four 
warring groups the long soughtafter solution to the countrys 
problems 
they say a sept 10 agreement to share power in a supreme 
national council supervised by the united nations is what the 
country needs 
signing the accord is the vietnaminstalled government of prime 
minister hun sen and a coalition that includes the khmer rouge 
khmer peoples national liberation front and forces of former 
cambodian leader prince norodom sihanouk 
the council is meant to be a symbolic government with the 
united nations running the country organizing a ceasefire 
planning elections ending all foreign military aid and disarming 
the four groups fighting for power 
but the groups have broken peace agreements in the past 
meanwhile the country is stagnating boys march into phnom 
penhs best restaurants to beg food off the plates of foreigners a 
mother washes her monthold baby under water dripping from a fire 
hydrant 
the bulk of cambodias property is so run down that it cant be 
rented electricity and running water are a luxury some people 
carry buckets of water to their homes up flights of stairs daily 
there are no official records of the countrys per capita income 
or unemployment rate according to cambodias mission to the united 
nations in new york said the missions first secretary p cheng 
all of the social structure is basically destroyed statistics 
are not possible 
the world almanac book of facts in 1990 cites sixyearold 
statistics as its most recent listing 100 as the per capita 
income in 1984 
some blame cambodias troubles on its history as a political 
pawn the country has been at the mercy of outside powers like 
china the soviet union and the united states for years 
american policymakers look at cambodia through an empty 
vietnamese glass it is not how to help cambodia but how to punish 
vietnam said khieu kanharith former editor of a weekly 
stateowned newspaper 
khieu was referring to the us trade restrictions imposed 
against cambodia because of its 11year occupation by vietnam 
the international boycott is keeping us from progressing the 
only one way for us to catch up with our neighboring countries is 
with international aid khieu said 
further evidence of a country trapped in the past is just inside 
the national pedriatric hospital the countrys showcase hospital 
dr chour ymeng the hospitals vice director pointed to the 
sick people lining hallway floors he showed a visitor the red 
blotches dotting a baby caused by malnutrition which is easily 
preventable 
chour said he is one of only a handful of doctors who survived 
the khmer rouge killing fields if more doctors had lived perhaps 
more children could be saved today he said 
chour isnt the only one who thinks about what could have been 
the brother of khmer rouge leader pol pot has spent years picturing 
life without the genocidal group 
loth suong lives in a rundown housing project without 
electricity to power his refrigerator a television or even lights 
his brother lives in a thai beach villa and has yet to be brought 
to justice for his genocidal rule 
my brother brought cambodia down if the country has no khmer 
rouge ordinary people will have a good living standard said 
loth 79 because i am old i need only peace now i call for you 
to give peace to cambodia 
ros sopea a 29yearold journalism student at phnom penh 
university said there arent enough social services such as 
schools or hospitals in cambodia 
but she said cambodia would develop quickly if only the war 
would end freeing the countrys estimated 6 million people to 
produce enough rice to get ahead 
not everyone has ros faith 
lim sothy fled cambodia several months ago clutching an english 
dictionary the 18yearold headed for a refugee camp just inside 
thailand when last seen he had about 215 miles fields of 
landmines and border guards to get past 
but lim said he had nothing to lose

two army deserters who hijacked a 
domestic airliner surrendered on sunday freeing the last of dozens 
of hostages and ending a twoday standoff officials reported 
the jetliners pilot said the two hijackers themselves didnt 
seem to know why on friday they had commandeered the air algerie 
boeing 737 carrying 88 people from the saharan town of ghardaia to 
algiers the plane was forced to land in the eastern city of 
annaba 
the hijackers handed their firearms over to police shortly after 
dawn following negotiations with the interior minister the state 
news agency aps reported the two identified as deserters from 
ghardaia then were whisked away in a police car to an undisclosed 
location 
im very happy with the happy outcome of this affair aps 
quoted interior minister saleh mohammedi as saying the authors 
of this hijacking will be prosecuted 
their ages were listed as 22 and 23 but their names were not 
disclosed and their motivation remained a mystery to their 
captives 
its something i just wasnt successful in bringing up and i 
had a lot of leisure time to discuss with them said capt salim 
zemti one of the two final hostages released 
they seemed ignorant themselves of the reason behind what they 
were doing zemti said but he added they may have been 
exasperated with their living conditions and decided to hijack a 
plane on the spur of the moment 
zemti said the pair first demanded to be flown to tripoli 
libya but the plane lacked fuel for the trip they settled for 
carthage in tunisia but tunisian authorities refused them 
permission to land 
they finally touched down saturday in annaba near the 
algeriatunisia border 
zemti and passengers reported no illtreatment 
local officials in ghardaia said the two deserted their base 
friday and ran 14 miles to the airport before hijacking the 
algiersbound flight 
they speculated the hijacking may have been an attempt to escape 
prosecution for desertion passengers said the pair spoke little 
and used varying regional accents in an apparent effort to mask 
their identities 
transport minister hassan kahlouche and passengers said the 
hijackers made no statements to support reports they were 
protesting a crackdown on islamic fundamentalists in neighboring 
tunisia 
one passenger said the hijackers broke into laughter on 
hearing such a report saturday on algerian radio 
right now this only concerns a simple affair of common law 
aps quoted kahlouche as saying 
air algerie said at least 14 passengers aboard the plane were 
foreigners algerian and western officials said they included 
french german italian british and japanese nationals most of 
the foreigners were freed on saturday 
the breakthrough came after dawn on sunday the hijackers 
announced they would free most of the remaining 52 captives but 
planned to hold the pilot and copilot and renewed demands for fuel 
to fly to another country 
the interior minister approached the plane and finalized the 
release of the captives witnesses said after they disembarked he 
then persuaded the hijackers to give up 
various reports during the negotiations said the hijackers had 
demanded water and enough fuel to fly to egypt or libya 
egyptian officials said their airports had been ordered to 
refuse them permission to land there was no comment available from 
libya

moldavia acting to defuse one of the soviet 
unions most explosive ethnic conflicts agreed sunday to comply 
with a kremlin order to reconsider its law making moldavian the 
republics official language 
the republics parliament acted in response to a decree issued 
on dec 22 by president mikhail s gorbachev the official news 
agency tass reported 
gorbachev also gave the republic 10 days to dissolve a new 
national guard and to come up with measures guaranteeing equal 
rights for all ethnic groups within its borders 
tass said the moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard 
and to revise a law that gorbachev said restricted the rights 
of minorities 
ethnic tension has gripped moldavia a largely agricultural 
republic bordering romania during its push for independence from 
the soviet union this year the unrest turned violent last month 
when government troops clashed with activists leaving four dead 
gorbachev said the conflicts had reached critical levels 
and he put part of the blame on the moldavian supreme soviet for 
enacting laws that discriminate against minorities 
alarmed by rising moldavian nationalism two of the republics 
minority groups have begun their own separatist movements 
the gagauz a group of about 150000 turkish christians 
declared a new republic in southern moldavia in the eastern part 
of moldavia more than 300000 ethnic russians and ukrainians have 
joined in declaring a new republic along the dneister river 
all three groups claim discrimination by moldavians in 
particular they resent a new law making moldavian the official 
language and requiring people in dozens of jobs ranging from 
doctors to hairdressers to pass moldavian language tests by 1995 
tass did not say how the moldavian parliament would modify the 
law 
moldavian is identical to romanian except for the cyrillic 
script josef stalin imposed on the republic it is spoken by 
twothirds of the republics residents 
soviet hardliners want gorbachev to impose a state of emergency 
and presidential rule in troubled zones throughout the ethnically 
and geographically diverse country 
gorbachev said the declaration of the gagauz and dniester 
republics was illegal under the soviet and moldavian constitutions 
as were elections to form legislatures and any actions by those 
bodies the moldavian legislature has also voted to declare the 
elections null and void 
after residents of the gagauz region began holding local 
elections in late october the moldavian legislature clamped a 
twomonth state of emergency on the region restricting movement in 
and out of the area and banning public rallies 
volunteer brigades of collegeage moldavians who then flocked 
to the region to try to stop the separatist movement were ordered 
dissolved by gorbachevs decree the volunteers were organized by 
nationalist groups including the moldavian peoples front

we ushered in the 90s a year ago but the last decade of the

the conservative government reversed 
itself sunday and said it would not go ahead with announced plans 
to pardon greeces jailed military dictators 
a government announcement said the decision to back down from 
the pardons of leaders of the 196774 rightwing military 
government was made to avoid political tension 
prime minister constantine mitsotakis said friday he decided to 
pardon nearly all the remaining jailed former members of the junta 
for humanitarian reasons that provoked cries of outrage from 
conservatives socialists communists and other leftists both in 
greece and on the island of cyprus 
the universal condemnation both in greece and on cyprus by 
the overwhelming majority of the people forced the government to a 
hasty retreat said andreas papandreou the leader of the main 
opposition socialists 
approval had been expected by a government committee this week 
and by president constantine caramanlis but newspapers reported 
sunday that caramanlis would not sign such a presidential decree 
his office would not confirm the reports 
the governments change of heart came at a cabinet meeting its 
announcement said 
in order to avoid turning this issue into the object of 
artificial political tension it decided to not advance the 
procedures for the granting of a pardon the announcement said 
it said the time for a pardon was not ripe because the larger 
issues of the land more than ever call for unity 
it accused socialists and communists of trying to take advantage 
of the decision to pardon the jailed dictators because of their 
smalltime interests 
a protest against the pardons had been planned for monday 
papandreou whose socialist government ruled from 1981 to 1989 had 
said he would request an emergency debate in parliament on the 
issue 
leftists accused mitsotakis of repaying a political debt to a 
projunta rightist group that has backed his new democracy party 
the former rulers themselves never sought pardon or amnesty but 
junta supporters have lobbied for an amnesty since the officers 
were sentenced 
most politicians conservative and leftwing were jailed 
tortured or exiled during the seven years of authoritarian military 
rule those imprisoned were convicted of treason torture or the 
murder of prodemocracy student protesters 
eight members of the junta are serving prison terms ranging from 
20 years to life imprisonment 
those serving life sentences include col george papadopoulos 
71 who led the 1967 coup his brother constantine 69 and former 
brig dimitris ioannides 67 ioannides exchief of the dreaded 
military police overthrew papadopoulos in a 1973 coup 
under mitsotakis proposal the only junta member who would not 
have been pardoned was ioannides who also engineered a failed 1974 
coup in cyprus by rightwing supporters of the islands union with 
greece 
the disastrous coup attempt prompted an invasion of cyprus by 
turkey which partitioned the eastern mediterranean island it also 
caused the juntas collapse and the restoration of democracy in 
greece 
on cyprus nearly all political parties condemned the proposal 
to pardon the leaders government spokesman akis fantis said 
cypriots will always hold the greek military dictators responsible 
for the islands division

the leading british actors of his generation renowned for his 
shakespearean roles he is on tour as the bards richard iii and as 
kent in king lear 
mckellen who has also done much to raise money for aids 
charities said he was very surprised and delighted with the 
honor 
barbara cartland 89yearold doyenne of romantic fiction 
writers becomes a dame of the british empire miss cartland who 
has just finished her 530th book said she was delighted and very 
honored to be made a dame 
she said she thought the award probably was not for literary 
achievement but for the charity work she did 
her daughter raine became stepmother to princess diana when 
she married dianas father earl spencer 
also named a dame is lucie rie 88 a distinguished potter whose 
work is in the collection of many museums including the museum of 
modern art in new york

and literary critic john frank kermode and terence english 
director of the worldrenowned heart transplant research unit at 
papworth hospital in cambridgeshire 
among those to receive a royal victorian medal a personal gift 
from queen elizabeth ii is walter gimpel 64 a former prisoner of 
war he works as a gardener in the crownowned great park in 
windsor 20 miles west of london 
british forces captured gimpel then an 18yearold conscript in 
the german army in 1944 after the german retreat from paris the 
medal is an honorary award because gimpel has retained his german 
citizenship

and film actor marius goring whose movies include the red 
shoes and the barefoot contessa 
the queen bestowed 995 titles and medals most of them to

twice yearly expression of gratitude 
the list was drawn up before mrs thatchers resignation but 
the new prime minister john major reviewed it before publication 
the other awards are made in june with the queens birthday list 
it is unusual for there to be only one life peerage but the new 
list follows 10 days after mrs thatcher followed custom and 
submitted an honors list in conjunction with her resignation her 
list included seven life peerages 
although critics say the ancient honors tradition has been 
tarnished by political patronage a barony a knighthood or a 
british empire medal is still a prize to be treasured there is no 
cash reward but to many the rise in status is priceless 
barons and baronesses are addressed as lords and ladies and can 
sit in parliaments unelected house of lords in the company of 
britains ancient aristocratic families knights are addressed as 
sir and their female equivalents are dames 
an officer of the order of the british empire gets to add obe 
after his or her name

or break time for president bush who faces the twin challenges of 
the persian gulf crisis and the economic recession 
dole who lost to bush in the 1988 republican presidential 
primaries played down difficulties bush has had with conservatives 
in his own party i think he should have satisfied most thinking 
conservatives the others you cant satisfy dole said on 
nbctvs meet the press 
he said he had heard rumblings that conservatives wanted to 
mount a challenge to bush in 1992 but he had no details

bush fares if he runs for a second term 
i think its make or break time for george bush he said 
weve got twin problems he said referring to the gulf and the 
economy 
i think he could do very well in the gulf and still go 
downhill on the economy dole said that may be more difficult 
to deal with in the final analysis than the gulf crisis

vice president dan quayle said 
sunday he stopped playing at an allwhite golf course because it 
might look bad but he has no problem playing at a club that 
excludes women 
quayle who cut short a golf outing friday at the allwhite 
cypress point golf course in pebble beach calif said he will 
continue to play at burning tree course outside washington where 
women are barred as members and cant even play as guests 
quayle said he is an honorary member of burning tree by virtue 
of being vice president but is not a dues paying member 
ive played there before and ill play there again he said 
when asked about the matter by reporters traveling with him to 
visit us troops in saudi arabia 
ironically quayle was explaining himself on the issue while 
flying to a country that has bars women from driving or 
socializing or working with men 
quayle said he decided to cancel a friday round of golf at 
cypress point after learning it was the subject of controversy 
because of its allwhite membership 
the club was forced to drop out of the 1991 atampt pebble beach 
proam professional golf association tournament because it refused 
to change its policies to make sure blacks could join the club the 
club does not bar black members but said it was unwilling to have 
blacks skip over the long waiting list for membership 
the pgas new rules hold that no club can host its tournaments 
that do not have minority members 
quayle said he had not known about the controversy when he 
played there on thursday 
asked how he could not know of the issue which was highly 
publicized in the golf world he said very few people knew about 
it they knew about it in california i didnt know about it i 
dont have time to read a lot about golf these days 
he noted that blacks can play as guests cypress point does 
not discriminate he said adding however that perceptions 
are important and therefore i chose to exercise judgment along 
those lines in canceling the game friday after public criticism 
arose 
he did not apply the same standard to burning tree 
im not going to protest burning tree he said maybe 
theyll change i think it would be a good idea for them to take 
women into the club i dont have any problem playing there in the 
meanwhile 
further he noted there are a lot other very well respected 
people that have played at burning tree the clubs membership 
roster long has boasted some of the nations most powerful men

author salman rushdie is expected to emerge from 
nearly two years of hiding to travel to egypt early next year at 
the invitation of moslem scholars a british newspaper reported 
sunday 
such a trip would be in defiance of threats by iranian religious 
leaders to kill the indianborn author for allegedly blaspheming 
islam in his novel the satanic verses 
the report in the weekly observer newspaper followed rushdies 
announcement on dec 24 that he had embraced islam and would oppose 
further translations of his book and prevent a paperback edition 
the observer reported that egyptian president hosni mubarak had 
approved the invitation from egypts minister for islamic affairs 
dr muhammad mahgoub it said rushdie would visit there with 
leading moslem scholars 
a mubarak press spokesman mohammed abdelmoneim said in cairo 
that he didnt know of any such invitation adding mubarak is 
preoccupied with much more important issues 
the spokesman said he could not rule out that such an invitation 
had been made by mahgoub in his capacity as a moslem scholar 
mahgoub was not immediately available for comment 
the observer said the move was welcomed by the spiritual head of 
sunni moslems grand sheik gad elhak the newspaper quoted him as 
saying rushdie should not be held responsible for any sins he 
may have committed before embracing islam 
rushdies supporters expressed disappointment sunday with his 
decision to stop further translations and prevent a paperback 
edition 
rushdies decision was an attempt to persuade iranian religious 
leaders to cancel the death sentence issued by the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini in feb 1989 but iran has rejected rushdies 
effort 
the sunday times reported friends of rushdie reacted with 
disbelief and said their campaign for free speech was in 
tatters 
it seems the religious terrorists have won playwright 
arnold wesker was quoted as saying in the sunday times of london 
wesker a leading member of the rushdie defense committee 
called the development incredibly depressing 
the newspaper quoted alan sillitoe who signed a statement 
defending rushdies right to express his ideas as saying 
the inability to publish the paperback is a blow to writers 
it makes you imagine there will be a time when you will have to 
send books up to bradford a northern city with has a large moslem 
community to be stamped in case they have anything offensive in 
them 
writer fay weldon who wrote a booklet defending rushdie said 
she was sad rushdie appeared to be backing down 
if you appear to weaken they advance she said 
however frances dsouza chairman of the defense committee 
told the sunday times what an individual does and what he 
chooses to do in a spiritual sense is his own affair what we are 
fighting for is that no person should be condemned to death for 
expressing an opinion that issue remains 
rushdie 43 a british national remains in hiding under police 
guard in recent weeks rushdie has broken his isolation by several 
quick visits to bookstores and interviews 
the independent on sunday in a telephone interview with 
rushdie askd him what he would say to those who saw his previous 
stand for his novel not just as a defense of literature but also an 
attack on religious intolerance 
if they see islam as an enemy then they are not my friends 
rushdie replied

former authoritarian ruler chun 
doohwan said sunday he wants only to live as an ordinary 
citizen now that he had ended two years of selfimposed exile 
however radical student leaders have renewed demands that chun 
be prosecuted for alleged corruption human rights violations and 
abuses of power they called chun a symbol of suppression and 
blamed him for crushing a 1980 prodemocracy uprising in kwangju in 
which at least 200 people died 
about 2500 police guarded streets and alleyways near chuns 
seoul home about 150 supporters some waving welcome placards 
greeted chun and his wife lee soongja when they arrived earlier 
in the day 
chun returned to the capital from a remote 14th century buddhist 
temple in the eastern mountains where he had gone two years ago to 
atone for past wrongs 
in the future i will continue to live as an ordinary 
citizen the former general said in a statement o at seouls 
yonsei university 30 radical student leaders issued a statement 
pledging to fight and crush what they called president roh 
taewoos plot to perpetuate chuns 198087 government 
roh a former general who helped chun seize power in 1980 has 
appealed to the nation for mercy for chun news reports said roh 
sent an orchid plant to chuns home sunday with a message reading 
ushering out the past ushering in the new 
chun left seoul to go into exile in november 1988 after 
apologizing for alleged corruption human rights violations and 
abuses of power during his rule nationwide demonstrations in 1987 
forced chun to call elections and step down 
more than a dozen of chuns relatives and associates were 
convicted of wrongdoing and imprisoned rohs government never took 
action against chun who said he was innocent 
chun was a founder of rohs democratic liberal party some 
observers feel his return is an orchestrated effort by roh to 
consolidate the party which has been riddled by factional 
fighting 
opposition leader kim daejung has said he would not oppose chun 
resuming a normal life but he warned the former president to avoid 
politics 
in 1987 mass antigovernment protests forced chun to accept 
opposition demands for direct popular elections he handpicked roh 
as the governing party candidate and roh won the presidency by a 
narrow margin in december 1987 chun now claims credit for the 
countrys first peaceful transfer of power 
even after his exile dissatisfied dissidents and students 
staged violent protests demanding his arrest police guards were 
deployed outside the temple where he sought refuge

tamil rebels on sunday offered the sri 
lankan government an indefinite new years truce saying peace 
talks could begin if the proposed ceasefire takes hold 
a statement issued by the tamil tigers office in london said 
the rebels will unilaterally stop their attacks at midnight monday 
in case the government fails to respond to our peace 
initiative our national liberation army will reserve the right to 
defensive armed actions the statement said 
there was no immediate government reaction the truce offer was 
the top story in the sunday observer a government newspaper that 
has taken a strong stand against the rebels 
a senior defense ministry official speaking privately said 
so far as we are concerned our military operations against the 
tigers are continuing as usual 
on thursday deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne rejected 
the possibility of a ceasefire and said peace in 1991 would depend 
on the governments efficiency in liquidating the tamil tigers 
at least 14000 people have died in fighting since the rebels 
began their violent campaign for a separate homeland in 1983 
the rebels accuse the sinhalese buddhist majority of 
discriminating against the tamils who are mostly hindus tamils 
make up 18 percent of the population of 16 million on this island 
off the southern coast of india 
sundays was the first ceasefire offer by the rebels since they 
scuttled a 13month long truce with the government and resumed 
fighting june 11 at least 4000 people have died in violence since 
then 
in an interview last week from london senior rebel leader 
sathasivam krishnakumar had said the ceasefire might last only a 
few days and would be linked to a demand that government troops 
remain in their barracks 
but the tigers statement sunday set no conditions for the 
indefinite ceasefire and declared it a goodwill gesture 
our unilateral decision to observe a ceasefire has placed the 
entire responsibility with the sri lankan government as to whether 
to maintain peace or to continue to wage war against our people 
it said 
the government controls several major towns in eastern sri 
lanka but the tigers move easily in the jungles and dominate the 
north

vice president dan quayle told saudi 
king fahd on sunday that the united states expects more financial 
support from the oilrich nation for us military efforts against 
iraq and the arab ruler seemed to agree us officials said 
they said no figures were mentioned in the twohour meeting but 
that us officials left with the impression there will be no 
problem getting more money with the saudis 
they have been forthcoming on that subject said one senior 
administration official the impression that was left was that 
they would continue to be forthcoming they dont want any 
perception of any reluctance on that issue 
quayle who was not available to reporters after the late night 
meeting had said in advance that he intended to tell saudi leaders 
they will have to be making more contributions 
the vice presidents threeday visit began just 16 days before 
the united nationsimposed jan 15 deadline for iraq to withdraw 
its troops from kuwait or face possible war 
the us official who discussed the quaylefahd meeting on 
condition of not being identified by name said the two were in 
virtually complete agreement on what needed to be done in terms 
of forcing iraq out of kuwait 
there was no reticence on fahds part to the idea of 
launching a war against iraq if president saddam hussein does not 
withdraw the official said 
the official said quayle also assured fahd that despite 
reluctance expressed by some members of congress president bush 
would have the latitude to do what he felt he had to do after 
jan 15 including a military strike 
quayle met separately with fahd and the saudi deputy prime 
minister crown prince abdullah shortly after his arrival 
he planned to meet with kuwaits exile emir on tuesday after a 
new years day visit to some of the more than 300000 us troops 
in the region 
the pentagon previously has projected the cost of operation 
desert shield as the deployment is called at 82 billion through 
the end of 1990 the costs are expected to increase however 
because of the additional troops currently being deployed a 
fullscale shooting war has been estimated to cost as much as 1 
billion to 2 billion a day 
you are seeing other nations making contributions i will 
thank the saudis and kuwaitis for the contributions they have 
made thus far but point out that more contributions will have to 
be made because the crisis is going to continue said quayle 
so far saudi arabia has contributed 9 billion nearly half of 
it in cash and the rest in military support for us troops in 
saudi arabia according to the state department kuwait has given 
25 billion us officials said 
saudi arabia also has spent 39 billion and kuwait 33 billion 
to help countries such as turkey and egypt that have suffered 
severe economic repercussions from the unimposed economic 
sanctions against iraq 
quayle will spend much of new years day visiting with us 
troops in the gulf 
among those deployed to the region are units of the indiana 
national guard in which quayle served during the vietnam war he 
was later embroiled in controversy over whether he used family 
connections to get into the guard unit rather than risk being 
drafted and sent to vietnam 
asked about president bushs comment to time magazine that he 
has a gut feeling saddam hussein will withdraw by the deadline 
quayle said he was not as optimistic 
i hope he does but i certainly do not see any information 
that he will do so saddam hussein has always done the unexpected 
lets hope he does the unexpected again said quayle but he 
added if force is required it will be swift it will be 
massive it will be certain

the father of a braindamaged patient 
at the hospital where nancy cruzan was allowed to die after a court 
fight has been blocked from moving his daughter to a state where 
her feeding tube could be removed with less legal strife 
pete busalacchi says his daughter christine should be allowed 
to die but don lamkins director of the missouri rehabilitation 
center contends ms busalacchi has mental functions and responds 
to commands 
ms busalacchi 20 has spent 3 years in a vegetative state 
similar to that of ms cruzan who was buried friday after becoming 
a focus of national debate and a landmark us supreme court ruling 
on the right to die 
the case renewed warnings sunday from euthanasia opponents that 
a tidal wave of death for hopeless patients would result from 
the cruzan case 
lamkins said sunday that the 10day restraining order issued 
saturday will give doctors time to examine ms busalacchi lawrence 
county judge scott sifferman scheduled a jan 8 hearing to hear 
results of the tests 
there are parallels in the cruzan and busalacchi cases both 
young women suffered severe brain damage in car crashes their 
parents contended there was no sign of recognition pain or emotion 
in either patient and neither left written instructions about 
being kept alive in case of debilitating illness or injury 
busalacchi said sunday that he was angry and frustrated about 
the legal action 
my feeling is my daughter died a long time ago and all thats 
left is just a machine busalacchi said from his home in st 
charles mo a suburb of st louis 
busalacchi said he had hired a lawyer and planned to fight 
i will not see my daughter held prisoner in missouri he 
said 
the us supreme court ruling in its first righttodie case 
said june 25 that missouri could require clear and convincing 
evidence that ms cruzan 33 would not want to be kept alive in 
her vegetative state her relatives returned to state court with 
three witnesses whose testimony led to a judges permission to 
remove ms cruzans feeding tube on dec 14 
she died 12 days later 
busalacchi said he spoke sunday morning with ms cruzans 
father joe who told me to be strong and offered to help in any 
way he could 
busalacchi expected to move christine on saturday to 
minneapolis where specialists were to decide whether her tube 
should be removed under state provisions that recognize ethical 
decisions by doctors 
dr ronald cranford of hennepin county medical center in 
minneapolis one of ms busalacchis doctors said saturday it 
would be the first case he knew in which a person was transferred 
from a state with a highly restrictive righttodie law to another 
state to allow removal of lifesupport equipment 
cranford a neurologist and medical ethicist who has been a 
consultant in the busalacchi case said ms busalacci is incapable 
of any conscious thoughts or deliberate actions the finding is 
based on the medical records and his personal observations 
in an affidavit filed with the judge saturday lamkins said 
there was scientific and observational evidence that ms 
busalacchi was cognitive of her surroundings and does have some 
mental functions 
he said that on dec 19 on a nurses command the young woman 
waved at him 
she waved only one finger when the nurse said you can do 
better than that or words to that effect christine busalacchi 
waved at me with all her fingers clearly aware of what was said to 
her and of her surroundings 
the father rejected lamkins observations 
yes her fingers can move but it doesnt happen on command 
it doesnt happen with consistency he said they also say she 
can smile at you but its no smile that you or i would 
recognize 
activists raised protests sunday 
certainly this has set off the tidal wave we warned about 
since there is no clear and convincing evidence in christines case 
that she would want to die rita marker director of the 
international antieuthanasia task force said sunday from 
steubenville ohio 
we have to realize that much of this debate has to do with 
relieving the family of a burden she said 
kay s dowhower washingtonbased director of governmental 
affairs for the evangelical lutheran church in america said sunday 
that denominations which supported the cruzans should also 
sympathize with busalacchi who in the early 1970s had to decide to 
take his terminally ill wife off lifesupport equipment 
the evangelical lutherans joined four other major denominations 
in supporting the cruzans

president guillermo endara has 
rejected the national assemblys callfor an investigation of a new 
security agency that he reportedly set up with help from the cia 
and without legislative approval 
the assembly on saturday created a commission to investigate the 
council of public security and national defense it also criticized 
endara for disrespectful and excessive treatment of a deputy 
who questioned his creation of the agency without legislative 
approval 
the miami herald and the washington post reported recently that 
panama formed an intelligence agency with help from the cia and the 
taiwanese and venezuelan security services 
endara late saturday accused the lawmakers of trying to meddle 
in matters which are the private affairs of the executive branch 
it seems that some legislators are interested in getting rid 
of a service of security and defense information which reports 
directly to the president endara said 
he denied that the new council created by executive order in 
february was involved in espionage 
a dec 25 washington post story said the agency was created in 
july had 100 members and was being established with the help of 
the cia 
many panamanians are suspicious of the agency the post 
reported because the cia also once maintained a relationship with 
gen manuel antonio noriega the strongman was overthrown in last 
decembers us invasion 
the story said the agencys director was menalco solis a former 
law partner of endara who was also treasury minister in noriegas 
puppet civilian government in 198485

about 40000 argentines rallied 
outside president carlos menems office sunday to protest his 
pardon of key figures who served in the military dictatorship 
during the 1970s dirty war on leftists 
menems action saturday revealed a nation still bitterly divided 
over a painful period of its history 
roman catholic bishop jaime de nevares said the pardons mocked 
justice broke the law and trampled on human rights another church 
leader archbishop antonio quarracino said they were necessary and 
make me happy 
the two rival factions of the general labor federation 
argentinas major labor group were also divided 
recent polls showed up to 80 percent of argentines opposed the 
pardons 
the pardons included mario firmenich 42yearold cofounder of 
the montonero terrorist movement and former presidents jorge 
videla 65 and roberto viola 66 who ruled the country from the 
1976 coup until 1982 and nine other officials 
sunday afternoon about 40000 people a crosssection of ages 
income levels political parties and professions gathered outside 
menems office waving banners and angrily denouncing the pardons 
were here to tell him that we havent forgotten what 
happened and we wont forget said protester daniel sossa he 
said his aunt was arrested during the 197683 dictatorship and 
never heard from again 
menem himself jailed without charge during the period told 
reporters they can have all the marches they want that 
doesnt bother me i believe it was best for my country period 
videla freed saturday after more than five years in prison 
attended mass at a chapel near his apartment sunday and handed 
reporters a short statement that said in part i ask god to 
extinguish forever the hatred among argentines with the goal that 
we all may reconcile ourselves in peace union and liberty 
viola videla and six other senior officers were pardoned for 
crimes including torture illegal detention and murder former 
finance minister jose martinez de hoz and two former civilian 
officials all of whom had been jailed on other charges were 
included in the pardon 
menem said the pardons by ending a justification for military 
restiveness would allow argentina to look ahead but many said 
they merely reopened wounds 
the pardons do not leave the past behind but take us back to 
the worst failures of our past said former president raul 
alfonsin leader of the main opposition party the radical civic 
union 
this is the saddest day in argentine history he said 
urban terrorist attacks in the 1970s and the military juntas 
heavyhanded response still wrench argentinas national psyche 
seven years after the return to democracy with alfonsins election 
in october 1983 menem was elected last year 
alfonsin and the congress gave amnesty to hundreds of 
lowerranking officers after three military uprisings against his 
government to protest pending trials of soldiers accused of rights 
abuses 
a fourth rebellion to protest videlas imprisonment was crushed 
by the government dec 3 menem had earlier promised the military 
that the pardons were in the works 
the military insists it was forced to use unconventional methods 
to stop the leftist guerrillas many claim the military used the 
insurgency as a pretext for repression 
at least 8960 alleged leftists disappeared and were presumed 
executed human rights put the death toll at about 30000

congressional leaders said sunday the white 
house should redouble its efforts to find a peaceful solution to 
the crisis in the persian gulf because the american people dont 
want to fight a war in the region 
the american people are not yet committed to war and they 
want to make certain that president bush has done everything 
pursued every avenue for peace before the firing starts said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan on nbctvs meet the 
press 
the american people do not want war he said 
both dole and rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee said bush and iraqi president saddam 
hussein must break the stalemate over diplomatic talks between the 
two countries 
dole said he has received indications from iraq that saddam may 
be willing to show flexibility on dates for the talks 
people want to make sure that weve tried every other 
alternative before going to war that we tried to solve this every 
other way aspin said on cbstvs face the nation 
a diplomatic effort really needs to be made and has to be made 
before the decision to go to war he said 
with the un security councils jan 15 deadline for iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait drawing closer rep lee hamilton dind 
predicted a real intensification of diplomatic effort in the next 
few days 
hamilton chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on 
europe and the middle east also appeared on the cbs program 
hamilton and dole expressed optimism about a peaceful solution 
to the crisis 
my gut tells me that there will be a resolution of the 
crisis without firing a shot dole said 
added hamilton there are some straws there that indicate a 
diplomatic solution may work he cited fresh appeals by germanys 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher for a new diplomatic 
effort to try to avoid war 
people are very very nervous about the outbreak of war 
hamilton said 
the lawmakers comments complemented bushs remark in a time 
magazine interview to be published monday in which he said he has 
a gut feeling that saddam will withdraw from kuwait 
top democratic and gop congressional leaders will meet with bush 
on thursday the day that the new congress convenes 
aspin said congressional leaders are going to demand to know if 
bush intends to ask congress for warmaking authority before he 
uses force in the gulf 
i think thats a very very important thing that they the 
administration commit to do that that we do have a vote on that 
in congress he said 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo on saturday 
suggested democrats might try to cut off money for operation desert 
shield if bush goes to war without seeking congressional authority 
gephardt said un sanctions against iraq should be given at 
least 18 months to work 
but in a prelude to partisan wrangling over the issue dole 
called gephardts proposal incredible and declared id like 
him to tell that to the troops in the sands of saudi arabia 
the senates ranking gop member predicted neither the 
democratcontrolled house or senate would approve such a 
resolution that was a big big political mistake said dole of 
gephardts remark 
dole also said the antiiraq coalition would likely fall apart 
if the united states waited 12 months to 18 months for sanctions to 
work aspin repeated his skepticism about sanctions im not very 
bullish on sanctions he said 
but dole agreed with gephardt that americas allies japan and 
germany should pay a larger share of the cost of maintaining more 
than 300000 us troops in saudi arabia 
meanwhile aides to vice president dan quayle said he told saudi 
king fahd in a sunday evening meeting in riyadh that the united 
states expects more financial support from the oilrich nation for 
us military efforts against iraq and that the arab ruler seemed 
to agree 
they have been forthcoming on that subject said one senior 
administration official the impression that was left was that 
they would continue to be forthcoming they dont want any 
perception of any reluctance on that issue 
unless members of congress vote to stay in session specifically 
to tackle the gulf issue the lawmakers are expected to deal mostly 
with formalities when they meet this week before going home until 
after jan 20 
dole said lawmakers should leave washington unless they agree to 
pass a resolution backing the un measure which advocates force 
if necessary hamilton cautioned against congress engaging in a 
long debate on the gulf if there is no widespread support one way 
or the other it will send a signal of divisiveness thats not 
what we want to do now he said 
on the deadlock over diplomatic discussions dole said mohamed 
almashat iraq ambassador to the united states who is in baghdad 
for consultations told him in a saturday night telephone call that 
saddam may be willing to bend on the date 
i had some indication there was some flexibility by iraq on 
the date said dole adding theres got to be flexibility on 
bushs part as well 
iraq has invited secretary of state james baker iii to meet 
saddam hussein on jan 12 a date the white house has rejected 
because it is too close to the un deadline 
bushs invitation to iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to come 
to washington last december fell through because of the deadlock 
over the baker visit

albanian jews are being allowed to emigrate to 
israel and several have already arrived israel army radio reported 
sunday 
thirtyseven members of one family bound for israel boarded a 
flight sunday dubbed the flying carpet in tirana albanias 
capital and flew to rome said shula bahat a spokeswoman for the 
american jewish committee in new york 
this is going to save albanian jews from total extinction had 
they remained there they would have been wiped out in a 
generation said rabbi marc tanenbaum foreign relations 
consultant to the committee 
one tel aviv man with relatives in albania told the radio that 
the entire jewish community of that country was packed and ready to 
leave for israel 
the jews are not coming through official israeli channels but 
are sponsored by jewish organizations and unofficial agencies the 
radio said quoting officials it did not identify 
yehdua weinrab spokesman for the quasigovernmental jewish 
agency which is responsible for transporting immigrants to israel 
refused to comment on the exodus immigration minister yitzhak 
peretz also refused to comment 
the tel aviv man said some of his 60 relatives in albania had 
immigrated in the past two months 
the radio quoted unidentified officials who said israeli foreign 
ministry delegates in rome had arranged for the italian embassy in 
tirana to issue the travel permits 
but vladamir prela head of the albanian foreign ministrys 
press department denied there was a special program for the 
emigration of jews from albania 
you may recall that ramiz alia communist party chief has 
said those albanian citizens who want to work abroad can leave 
that also obviously applies to jewish citizens he said in a 
telephone interview 
the exact number of jews living in albania was not available but 
estimated to be about 1000 of the countrys 32 million citizens 
albanias hardline communist government which took power in 
1944 until recently did not permit religious worship most of the 
jews there are believed to no longer practice judaism 
the albanian government is now carrying out political reform as 
well including the legalization of some opposition

said 
sundays flight as well as future flights to the west for 
albanias jews has been nicknamed the flying carpet bahat

she said jews have not been allowed to practice their religion 
by albanias government one of the last in eastern europe to 
maintain a political hard line as surrounding countries turned to 
democracy 
jews were cut off and alienated in albania which was the 
leading stalinist government in eastern europe tanenbaum said 
under that regime religious and cultural freedom was totally 
denied 
the only way the albanian jews could keep their tradition 
alive was by doing it underground and behind closed curtains he 
said this means they can finally breathe fresh air

issue was a delicate one bahat said she did not know when the 
negotiations began

immigration minister yitzhak peretz presented 
his plan sunday for housing tens of thousands of the coming years 
expected 400000 soviet jewish immigrants in tent camps and army 
bases 
peretz presented his plan to the ministerial committee on 
immigration he he later fielded criticism of the tent camp 
proposal on israel television calling it an emergency plan for a 
time of distress 
i am always afraid that there could be a situation where 
immigrants will get stuck at the airport and we will have nowhere 
to put them peretz said on israel television 
the plan which still must be approved by the cabinet calls for 
establishing tent camps to house 10000 immigrants 
peretz defended his plan as one based on the successful 
absorption of about 200000 immigrants in 1990 
this is not just a theory or recommendation but an orderly 
and organized plan that promises the proper absorption of 400000 
immigrants peretz said on israel television 
at the meeting israels chief of staff dan shomron offered to 
house 70000 newcomers in army camps and to clear four training 
fields for immigrant trailers 
such a mission as immigration i would say is the most 
important mission today other than security shomron said on 
israel army radio 
we are talking about a solution for tens of thousands of 
immigrants it is not simple at all for the army it complicates 
things greatly but it is an important mission and we will do our 
part shomron added 
simha dinitz head of the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
responsible for transporting immigrants to israel has rejected 
tents as an outdated response to the housing shortage he has cited 
mobile homes and trailers as preferable options 
the government predicts one million soviets will arrive by the 
end of 1992 dinitz has said the figure could exceed two million 
before the wave of immigration ends 
housing is not the only problem the newcomers face israel 
television reported that the immigration ministers plan is based 
on the belief that by the end of 1991 140000 immigrants will be 
looking for work 
another 15000 will be unemployed and 55000 will be working at 
temporary jobs the television said 
israel already has an unemployment rate that fluctuates between 
88 and 10 percent

iraqs information minister said sunday 
that president bush must have been drunk when he suggested iraq 
might withdraw from kuwait and boasted we will show the world 
america is a paper tiger 
the minister latif jassim also insisted on iraqs proposed 
date of jan 12 for a visit by secretary of state james a baker 
iii washington has said that date is too close to the jan 15 un 
deadline for iraq to leave kuwait or face possible force 
iraqi president saddam hussein delivered a 15minute new years 
message sunday on iraqi tv in which he invoked both moslem and 
christian theology in condemning the united states and saudi 
arabia cnn carried the broadcast and provided english subtitles 
in this confrontation there have been those who betrayed 
jesus christ and who betrayed the principles and values of islam 
one luring and leading the other said saddam may god curse 
them all 
as did judas betray jesus so has bush betrayed through his 
aggresion and deeprooted evil the teachings of jesus christ 
he said 
vice president dan quayle told saudi king fahd on sunday that 
the united states expects more money from the oilrich nation for 
military efforts against iraq and the arab ruler seemed to agree 
us officials said in riyadh saudi arabia 
no figures were mentioned but us officials left the twohour 
meeting with the impression there will be no problem they said 
saudi arabia has cleared a windfall of billions from rising oil 
prices since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
quayle also found no reticence on fahds part to the idea of 
launching a war against iraq if saddam does not withdraw from 
kuwait one senior us official said 
an official baghdad newspaper said sunday that iraqis and other 
arabs will attack us and western targets worldwide if america and 
its allies move militarily against iraq 
with the jan 15 deadline drawing near foreign ministers of the 
12nation european community were to meet friday in luxembourg to 
discuss the persian gulf crisis 
the decision to hold an emergency meeting was announced sunday 
by the french foreign ministry the gathering had been proposed a 
day earlier by germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
who appealed again sunday for a fresh diplomatic effort to try to 
avoid war in the gulf 
but saddam insisted anew that any solution to the crisis must be 
linked to a resolution of the israelipalestinian conflict the 
united states israel and others have rejected any such linkage 
the iraqi news agency said saddams renewed call for linkage 
came in talks sunday with yugoslavias foreign minister the 
yugoslav official reportedly was seeking a new peace initiative on 
behalf of the nonaligned movement of which yugoslavia is the 
current chairman 
the us official with quayle who discussed his meeting with 
fahd on condition of not being identified by name said the two 
were in virtually complete agreement on what needed to be done 
to force iraq out of kuwait 
quayles staff said there were no plans for him to launch any 
new diplomatic initiative during his threeday trip to saudi 
arabia he was to visit us troops and consult with the exiled 
emir of kuwait 
jassim at a baghdad news conference derided bushs comment to 
time magazine that he had a gut feeling iraq might still 
withdraw from kuwait iraq will never do so jassim said 
bush he said must have been drunk and drunk people usually 
lose their senses 
jassim also repeated iraqs insistence on the jan 12 date for 
talks between baker and saddam 
our president has set the date and that is the only 
possibility there is no change said jassim 
he said iraq would not initiate hostilities in the gulf telling 
reporters we will never attack 
but if bush starts a war he will not be able to stop it 
we will show the world that america is a paper tiger you will see 
how the americans will kneel down he said 
a western diplomat meanwhile said us charge daffaires 
joseph wilson has stopped his almost daily efforts to talk to the 
iraqis about the date for any direct talks 
there are no forward movements at least not in baghdad 
said the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
the european decision to meet and discuss the crisis was 
welcomed by the iraqi ambassador to the united states but the 
envoy said europe should adopt an independent approach to the gulf 
it is high time for the europeans to enunciate their own 
policy and not to be subservient to the american policy mohammad 
sadek mashat told reporters at amman airport where he stopped en 
route back to washington after consultations in baghdad 
the iraqi threat of terrorist attacks against us and other 
installations came in the althawra daily which is the mouthpiece 
of iraqs ruling baath socialist party

their forces along the border as a precaution against an attack by 
the jewish state

creating a pretext for an israeli strike

that iraq could use jordan as a springboard for action against 
israel

low profile levy said
