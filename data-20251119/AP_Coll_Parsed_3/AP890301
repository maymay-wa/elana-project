the navy has equipment capable of recovering the 
cargo door that sank in 16800 feet of water after tearing away from 
a united airlines jumbo jet an undersea technician said 
the national transportation safety board has not decided whether 
to attempt to recover the door from the pacific ocean 85 miles 
southwest of honolulu said member lee dickinson he said however 
that examining the front cargo door would be very helpful to us in 
our analysis 
navy radar tracked a large object falling into the ocean about 45 
seconds after the pilot of uniteds flight 811 reported an inflight 
emergency early friday soon after taking off for auckland new 
zealand dickinson said tuesday night 
investigators suspect the cargo door popped open at 22000 feet 
tearing away with a large section of fuselage nine passengers 
seated on the right side of the boeing 747 jet were swept to their 
deaths 
the first lawsuits stemming from the accident were filed here 
wednesday 
mae s sapolu a united flight attendant from honolulu filed a 
state court lawsuit seeking unspecified damages from boeing co 
maker of the jumbo jet 
according to court documents sapolu was serving drinks in 
business class when the hole opened in the right side of the 
aircraft sapolu said she was thrown to the floor and had to cling 
to the leg of a seat to keep from being swept out of the plane 
edwin geoffrey tudor a passenger from new south wales australia 
also sought unspecified damages in his lawsuit filed in us 
district court accusing from united and boeing of neglect in 
maintaining the boeing 747 
sapolu and tudor said they suffered physical injuries and 
emotional distress 
capt david m cronin turned the crippled jet around and flew it 
100 miles on two of four engines landing safely at honolulu 
international airport 
the radar picked up something that could be a large piece of 
metal possibly the cargo door dickinson said 
that information is going back to washington dc to see if 
we can indeed determine that was the cargo door and its exact 
location 
we have the location at the surface of the water he said 
youre talking about three miles down one can only guess where 
that is 
paul wolcott a technician and submersible launch pilot at the 
university of hawaiis hawaii undersea research laboratory said it 
would be difficult but probably not impossible to find the cargo 
door 
a search for the door probably would begin with a towed 
underwater sonar sled to determine possible locations of the door 
and then the use of a remote operation vehicle equipped with a 
camera to pinpoint the location wolcott said wednesday 
the navy has rovs capable of hooking a line to the door so it 
could be pulled to the surface he said 
the least likely possibility because of the tremendous expense 
involved would be the use of the navys san diegobased sea cliff 
one of the worlds few manned submersibles capable of reaching that 
depth wollcott said 
dickinson said the ntsbs field work was nearly completed and 
investigators would leave hawaii by thursday 
jim guyette uniteds executive vice president for operations 
said the damaged jetliner will be repaired although there was no 
estimate on when it will be returned to service 
the air frame will be fixed in hawaii and the engines will be 
repaired in san francisco guyette told a news conference here 
wednesday 
about 10 of the passengers who were on flight 811 remain in 
hawaii as well as a few survivors of the missing and united is 
paying all expenses guyette said 
two united flight attendants are the only ones on the plane who 
remain hospitalized

gaining weight accompanies gaining office 
for many members of the general assembly 
lunches with lobbyists snacks during committee meetings and 
rounds of receptions and latenight dinners at the state capitals 
leading restaurants make staying thin as tough as and sometimes 
tougher than getting reelected 
just talk to delegates gene w counihan elijah e cummings 
howard p rawlings and william r mccaffrey 
the foursome top the scales at 1200 pounds collectively and in 
a wellpublicized weighin they vowed to lose weight by the end of 
the assemblys 90day session 
there are just too many opportunities for too much eating 
said counihan who put on 25 pounds during his first year in 
annapolis six years ago and has steadily gained since then 
delegate richard a palumbo who picked up a few pounds each 
session until he hit 200 said he understood his problem graphically 
when he started looking at photographs taken during his annapolis 
career me getting fatter and fatter and fatter 
its hard there is food everywhere palumbo said you go 
to a reception and you are talking with someone about something 
important to them they have a drink in their hand you have a 
drink they are plucking shrimp off a shrimp tree so you pluck 
some too you end up eating both sides of an issue

wildlife specialist peter t bromley has a 
way to get rid of mosquitoes in the yard put up a bat house which 
is similar to a bird house except it attracts a different type of 
winged occupant 
a bat might eat up 2000 mosquitoes every night said bromley 
of the virginia cooperative extension service at virginia tech if 
you have six or seven bats in your house thats more than 10000 
mosquitoes 
besides a bat house can be entertaining for homeowners bromley 
said 
on a summer night you just have to get a lawn chair sit it 
outside and wait to see if a bat flits out the bat house bromley 
said 
theyre great fliers so they have aesthetic appeal plus its 
fun to have guests look at your bat house and say theres no hole 
in the front then you can say thats a bat house and have a 
lot of fun talking about it around your place 
virginia tech said people can get free plans for a bat house by 
sending in a selfaddressed stamped envelope but so far the 
extension service has not been going bats answering requests it 
hasnt received any inquiries yet

a law that lets voters pick none of 
these candidates would be erased under a proposal by a state 
assemblywoman who says the option made nevada the laughingstock of 
the united states 
assemblywoman eileen brookman on tuesday asked the assembly 
elections committee to amend a bill she has introduced to repeal the 
option 
during the 1986 democratic primary for state treasurer none of 
these candidates got more votes than five hopefuls however the 
none voting is advisory only and doesnt stop a person from 
winning a race 
i think we are the laughingstock of the united states because 
of this she said id like to have this amended and the law 
repealed 
the 1975 legislature created the option sen don mello who 
introduced the original bill then as an assemblyman said the 
category was intended to boost voter turnout

call it toothy gold a getrich quick plan for 
an area devastated by the crash of the oil market 
across louisianas marshes once flush with profits from black 
gold small patches of land increasingly are being turned into 
alligator farms with investors hoping to quintuple their 
investments in short order 
year before last there were just under 9000 farmraised 
gators sold by 37 farms said dave taylor alligator research 
coordinator for louisianas department of wildlife and fisheries 
that number is going to reach 60000 quickly and could be up to 
100000 certainly within five years 
thats in addition to the 24000 wild alligators trapped each 
fall in carefully supervised hunts 
spurred by prices of 37 a linear foot for hides 21 new farms 
have opened in the past two years and we expect them to produce 
18000 gators taylor said the waiting list for permits for new 
farms is about 100 
jerry jones jr 28 went into business two years ago near 
sweetlake and expects to put 12000 hides a year on the market his 
farm is stateoftheart automated cleaning watersource heat 
pumps carefully supervised diets 
the result is quicker growth at less cost we have some are 56 
feet long in a year and six months we have 8monthold gators that 
are 2630 inches 
skins of wild alligators average seven feet in length and are 
used for luggage farmraised gators are skinned at two years old 
and about four feet long their hides are used for shoes purses 
belts and other smaller highfashion accoutrements requiring smaller 
patterns on the hides 
for about 30000 a potential farmer can put up a couple 
windowless cinderblock buildings on concrete slabs and be ready to 
raise 1000 gators a year it would take another 25000 to 30000 
to operate until the gators grew enough to sell at current prices 
1000 fourfoot hides would bring 148000 
the minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up to 
two feet in length and 2 square feet up to four feet in length 
taylor said buildings must be able to hold a few inches of water 
and be kept about 89 degrees 
the first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests 
paying landowners for the eggs and committing 17 percent of the 
hatch for return to the wild at 4 feet long thats a carefully 
researched percentage designed for zero growth in the population of 
15 million wild alligators reached after the alligator was taken 
off the endangered species list in the mid1970s 
the wild nests arent easy to find and female alligators guard 
their eggs about the only time in their lives they show maternal 
instincts 
no task for the timid taylor agreed but everybodys got to 
learn some time or another if they want to get into farming 
obviously what would be best for a guys first involvement 
would be to hire someone with a little experience in locating nests 
from the air thats the only way to go rent a helicopter and go 
find them and pick them up 
the success of farming ventures will almost certainly drive 
prices down and there are risks any time a market depends on 
fashion or something volatile he said i dont think the bottom 
will fall out of the price i dont think theyll go to 2 a foot 
but it certainly could go to half of what it is now 
jones a former trapper commercial diver and underwater welder 
who now devotes full time to his farm agrees with taylors 
analysis a lot of these farms youll see what happens prices 
are good right now but with all these hides coming on the market 
its going to have to go down 
but jones believes he will survive when others fail because his 
expenses are low look at it this way youve got an electricity 
bill of 500 a month to raise 1000 alligators and my bill is 150 
a month to raise 12000 
his major problem is finding enough nutria small water rodents 
to feed the gators nutria often are dyed like beaver and jones 
said the price of skins is so low right now that you cant get 
all you want last year i got 40000 pounds and i could have used 
140000 
he had to supplement with fish and horse and young alligators 
dont grow as quickly on that diet in addition too much fish gives 
alligators gout

it appeared the french and english languages 
could live together in quebec after separatist fervor abated nearly 
a decade ago but the struggle resumed in december and french 
appears to have won 
new issues arise constantly such as whether the inside of a bus 
is really outside for sign purposes and the answer almost every 
time is that the signs must be only in french the englishspeaking 
minority although disgruntled appears to accept that the fight is 
lost 
resigned is probably the right catchword said donald taylor 
a psychology professor at mcgill university 
language is a symbol of identity and it also is a resource that 
has associated power and status and success and access he said 
so these apparently minor events evoke very primary feelings 
quebec was a battleground of culture and language in the 1970s 
between the 81 percent with french heritage and a minority with a 
cultural kinship to ontario and the other englishspeaking provinces 
power shifted to the frenchspeaking majority in those years but 
the separatist tide ebbed after 1980 and with it the dispute over 
language when quebec voters rejected a sovereignty referendum 
then came a ruling by the supreme court of canada in december 
that a 1977 quebec requiring all signs to be in french was 
unconstitutional the court said french could be required to 
predominate on all signs but other languages could not be prohibited 
the provincial government which has broader powers than state 
governments in the united states overrode the decision with new 
legislation for the language on signs 
bill 178 as it is known requires that all outdoor signs still 
be solely in french but for the first time since 1977 allowed 
bilingual indoor signs premier robert bourassa described it as a 
compromise 
rallies by activists of both communities have accompanied the 
latest round english signs posted in the street risk being 
spraypainted and a fire blamed on arson heavily damaged the offices 
of alliance quebec the main englishlanguage lobby 
fewer street protests are held now but the conflict continues as 
regulations under bill 178 are interpreted to restrict indoor 
bilingual signs more than originally believed 
its taken 21 years but the quebec language war is finally 
over and the english have lost political columnist don 
macpherson wrote in montreals englishlanguage daily gazette 
jeff kelly of alliance quebec said in an interview my concern 
about bill 178 is its silliness you dont like a law to be silly 
as an example he cited the bourassa governments determination 
that the inside of a bus is really an outside location and thus not 
a proper site for bilingual signs 
a lot of people in both communities were spoiling for a 
fight kelly said the signs became symbols certainly the signs 
themselves are not whats at play 
a prevailing view in quebec is that the vigorous political fight 
of the 1970s spawned a new entrepeneurial spirit in the french 
community as seen in the provinces support for the new free trade 
agreement with the united states 
business administration became the major of choice at 
frenchlanguage universities bourassas provincial liberal party 
trounced the nationalist parti quebecois in 1985 elections 
many english speakers opposed to learning french left the 
province and expecially among the young bilingualism is becoming 
the norm 
alliance quebec figures put the rate of bilingualism among the 
english community which is centered in montreal at 60 percent in 
1986 compared with 37 percent in 1971 
until december the issue of signs was portrayed as being no 
longer controversial 
since then however english speakers have described the denial 
of bilingual signs as a major violation of individual rights and the 
french say the restriction is necessary to preserve their culture in 
north america 
the language is the essence of culture said claude filion a 
party quebecois member of the quebec legislature this compromise 
bill 178 is unacceptable to both the francophone and the 
anglophone 
filion said any relaxation of the sign law erodes french as the 
main language of the province 
our position is that mr bourassa should have maintained the 
status quo he said

soviet activist andrei d sakharov has been told 
that russian helicopter gunships fired on their own ground troops to 
prevent their capture by afgan rebels his soninlaw said tuesday 
night 
in the soviet union lt gen boris gromov who led the last 
contingent of soviet troops out of afghanistan on feb 14 said the 
allegation was monstrous 
sakharov has no evidence that soviet airmen fired on their own 
soldiers but he has heard it and he believes it said his 
soninlaw efrem yankelevich 
yankelevich refused to allow the associated press to speak 
directly with sakharov who with his wife yelena bonner is staying 
with his inlaws in suburban newton 
he didnt specify from whom he heard this kind of 
accusation yankelevich said hes not the first to make these 
accusations 
sakharov first made the charge in an interview with a canadian 
radio station during a recent visit according to an article in the 
soviet military newspaper red star 
gromov told the newspaper tuesday that he had never seen a soviet 
unit attack another to prevent capture and interrogation by the 
mujahadeen rebels 
i state definitely that there had not been nor could have been 
facts so monstrous gromov said 
yankelevich responded on the basis of the facts available to 
sakharov he has no reason to retract his statement 
sakharov and mrs bonner arrived in the united states from canada 
on feb 18 on their first such visit together it is not known how 
long their visit will last

if youse talk like dis and dont know nuttin 
about grammah and good english dont let mayah edward i koch know 
yup you be axin for it 
this spring the mayor and schools chancellor richard green are 
beginning a program to exorcise what green calls speech demons 
from the lexicons of young new yorkers who dont know or use 
standard english usage 
axe instead of ask for example and pitcher instead 
of picture brang for brought and meetcha for meet 
you 
and as koch himself used to say liberry instead of 
library 
it was brought to my attention that i was saying liberry i 
wasnt aware of it koch admitted tuesday 
the program grew out of kochs conversations with some of the 
nearly 1 million students in the city school system 
its new yorkese its white hispanic black koch said 
responding to suggestions that the new language program was aimed at 
ethnic or racial groups 
the language in some cases was ununderstandable koch said 
coining a word of his own 
the mayor had asked green to come up with a program to tackle the 
problem and last week green outlined it for koch and provided a 
list of the most commonly mispronounced and misused words and 
phrases 
the effort starts this spring with a oneday putting your best 
speech forward day during which teachers in all grades will focus 
on the list of speech demons a poster contest will produce graphics 
that will be circulated throughout the system 
the longterm plan includes more debating oral reports public 
service announcements and a booklet of classroom activities aimed at 
improving english 
all this green wrote should lead to substantive improvement 
of oral communication skills say what better speaking you 
betcha 
koch said for young new yorkers to compete with the best students 
across the nation and get good jobs they must be able to speak 
english properly and at the same time maintain your own heritage 
and wherever possible to learn the language of your ancestors 
some linguistic experts say such nonstandard english is a 
kind of dialect that isnt considered incorrect in the students 
social setting 
professor john mayer of new york universitys english education 
department said the effort could stigmatize some students the 
chancellors list he said included many phrases used by blacks and 
hispanics 
in his memo green pointed out that the program will make clear 
that our purpose is not to devalue anyones home language we will 
encourage students to recognize that to be successful in school and 
in the workplace they must be able to use formal english 
effectively 
this has nothing to do with accents koch said although the 
list shows caunuh for corner it has nothing to do with 
diction it has to do with syntax grammar and the expressions 
theyre going to concentrate on are effectively new yorkese and 
they cut across economics and race and ethnicity

the merce cunningham dance company opened its 
season at the city center on tuesday with the premiere of five 
stone wind and the choreographer himself was among the dancers 
for much of this 55minute work the stage is full of dancers but 
all are motionless except one or two the primary motif consists of 
standing on one foot while stretching bending and rotating the 
other leg 
this is not a dance that flows there are many entrances and 
exits from five different points only occasionally do dancers move 
in unison or as duet partners 
cunningham who will turn 70 in april does arm stretches bends 
and turns usually in the back of the group once on stage alone 
one would expect him to look silly among his trim young dancers 
but he fits the tone of the dance and makes one think about the 
effectiveness of one or two more mature dancers in the bunch 
cunningham is inventive enough even pursuing one choreographic 
idea to keep one interested throughout also we like long dances 
so the evening isnt spent mainly in intermissions between short 
dances still we became restless before the end 
costumes are leotard tops and skirts or pants later leotards 
only for the women in varying colors chosen by mark lancaster the 
score was created by john cage takehisa kosugi and david tudor and 
has a few painfully loud bursts of sound 
the first part of five stone wind had its premier in berlin 
last june the complete work bowed at the festival davignon in 
france in july 
the evening began with cunninghams 1968 rainforest the 
companys city center season runs through march 12 and two other 
premieres are scheduled cargo x and field and figures 
the company will perform at the leicester festival in england 
march 16 to 18 at the university of arizona in tempe april 1 and 2 
kennedy center in washington may 1 through 7 and cw post college 
on long island may 12 during july and august the company will dance 
in italy and france

konrad lorenz the worldrenowned 
scientist and author who won a nobel prize for his pioneering work 
in the field of human and animal behavior has died at age 85 the 
academy of sciences said tuesday 
lorenz who died of kidney failure monday night was famous both 
for his research and for the bestselling works on behavior that won 
him a worldwide reputation as a great humanist 
among his bestknown books is on aggression 
in 1973 lorenz behavioral research won him the nobel prize for 
medicine along with the scientists karl von frisch and nikolaas 
tinbergen 
chancellor franz vranitzky said tuesday the nation had lost a 
pioneering researcher and a humanistic thinker 
in science lorenz was known above all for his discovery of a 
process known as imprinting or the rapid and almost irreversible 
learning process that occurs in early childhood bonding animals to 
their biological mothers 
but he showed the process could be changed demonstrating that 
mallard ducklings for example would happily follow a human who 
greeted them shortly after birth and imitated quacking 
to millions lorenz was famed as the father of the gray 
geese a man whose detailed studies of geese and other birds and 
animals led him to some penetrating and often gloomy conclusions 
about humanity and its future 
his most controversial findings suggested that innate and 
instinctive behavior in animals such as aggression might be 
instinctive in humans as well 
he was a man of genius the founding father of ethology said 
french behavioral scientist remy chauvin who was close to loren 
for me he was a father figure said austrian scientist bernd 
loetsch a student of lorenz the thrust that this tiny land made 
in science and environmental thinking owes much to him 
born nov 7 1903 in vienna the son of a wellknown surgeon 
lorenz gained his first doctorate in medicine in his native city at 
the age of 25 
five years later after studies in vienna and new york he held a 
doctorate in zoology and psychology on the basis of a thesis on the 
flight of birds 
between 1923 and 1939 lorenz devoted months to learning the 
language of the many birds he kept in his home 
chauvin said lorenz was prompted to work with animals in nature 
after his studies in the united states where he noticed that the 
behavior of caged white rats he studied there differed from that of 
wild rats he had observed in austria 
he slept with geese lying down beside them to put their 
behavior in perspective but also for observations on man and the 
child without prejudices chauvin said 
in 1939 lorenz was given a professorship in the german town of 
koenigsberg today the soviet port of kaliningrad 
while there he wrote papers considered to reflect nazi views of 
science making him the target of criticism years afterwards 
in 1973 accepting the nobel prize lorenz apologized most 
deeply 
many highly decent scientists hoped as i did for a short time 
for good from national socialism and many quickly turned away from 
it with the same horror as i he said then 
in 1941 lorenz was drafted captured by the russians in 1944 he 
spent four years as a prisoner of war a time he later described as 
midway between being a teacher a joker a clown and a 
soulsoother 
returning home in 1948 with a manuscript written on sacks of 
cement and published years later as the back side of the mirror 
lorenz founded a center for behavioral research in altenberg 
in the 1950s he worked mostly in west germany where he headed 
the max planck institute for behavioral physiology in bavaria from 
1961 to 1973 
beginning in the 1960s lorenz authored a series of bestselling 
books including on aggression which was put out in german in 
1963 and in english in 1966 the eight deadly sins of the 
civilized world comparative behavioral studies the decay 
of the humane and the evolution of thought

most of sen daniel inouyes colleagues on a 
senate panel have spurned his invitation to join him on a sixnation 
tour despite his promise that the taxpayerpaid trip will mix 
pleasure with business 
inouye dhawaii the new chairman of the senate appropriations 
defense subcommittee has invited 17 panel members to accompany him 
to the middle east and europe for an onthescene evaluation of 
the changes which are occurring in several areas of significance to 
our nations defense requirements 
but inouyes letter of invitation also notes other attractions in 
germany italy egypt spain israel and turkey 
i also intend to make a special effort to allow time for visits 
to museums art galleries and religious and historical sites in the 
capitals and the countryside of these countries inouye wrote 
citing protocol demands he suggested that the senators bring 
along their spouses on what i know will be a most enjoyable and 
productive trip 
far from being a congressional junket this trip will take us 
to areas which i believe we need to visit to understand the 
dimensions of the problems confronting us national security and to 
meet the responsibilities we face as members of the subcommittee on 
defense he said 
the associated press obtained a copy of the letter which 
proposes the trip for the senates easter vacation the last two 
weeks of march 
only sen frank lautenberg dnj has definitely signed up 
although three senators arlen specter rpa bennett johnston 
dla and jake garn rutah are undecided according to an 
informal head count the rest say they have no plans to go 
sen ted stevens ralaska said tuesday that he has declined 
because i took those trips when i was chairman of the 
subcommittee 
the itinerary calls for three nights in munich three in rome 
two in istanbul three in cairo three in jerusalem and one in 
madrid 
the route was designed to allow members to see fracture zones 
of the geopolitical world said inouye whose subcommittee oversees 
spending for the defense department and the cia 
along the way the senators would share easter services with 
american forces aboard a ship in the persian gulf and review 
fundamental changes under way in the middle east peace process 
the congressional party will fly on an air force jet to ensure 
that we accomplish the objectives of our trip and to add a measure 
of security inouye said 
the government picks up all expenses for members of congress 
they receive daily per diem at the same rate as us diplomats 
abroad for example the daily rate is 163 in munich and 98 in 
cairo 
congressional spouses travel free with their mates on military 
aircraft but they must pay their own expenses a state department 
official familiar with the trip speaking on condition of anonymity 
said arrangements such as the exact dates are not yet firm 
in the senate foreign trips on behalf of a committee must be 
approved by the full committee chairman while those on behalf of 
the full senate must have the approval of the chambers majority and 
minority leaders 
inouye has yet to request formal approval of the trip from sen 
robert byrd dwva chairman of the appropriations committee 
according to marsha berry the committee spokeswoman 
byrd also a member of the defense panel will not accompany 
inouye byrd said spokeswoman tina evans plans to travel to west 
virginia thats the only traveling hell do in march 
lautenberg wants to accompany inouye because hes new on the 
committee and he wants to see all the installations said his 
spokesman steven schlein 
at least 13 subcommittee members said they have no plans to go 
most of them citing prior commitments and more pressing business at 
home 
sen warren rudman rnh isnt going in part because he 
doesnt like being in a large delegation he tends to prefer 
trips that are more focused said his spokesman paul jacobson 
sen patrick leahy dvt declined because he recently returned 
from the middle east an aide said 
senators have other plans for the recess according to the 
members or their aides ernest f hollings dsc jim sasser 
dtenn dennis deconcini dariz dale bumpers dark tom 
harkin diowa james mcclure ridaho bob kasten rwis alfonse

gena spero might be legally insane but if she 
takes the medication that calms her she could be in prison for the 
rest of her life 
the drug dilemma has kept the 25yearold spero shuttling between 
jail mental institutions and courtrooms since jan 10 1983 the 
day she allegedly strangled 21yearold gina sindoni whose nude 
body was found in a bathtub 
after spero was charged in the slaying she was diagnosed as a 
paranoid schizophrenic and placed on antipsychotic medication she 
was found competent to stand trial if she relied on such drugs 
spero now a psychiatric patient at medfield state hospital is 
taking her lawyers advice to refuse the drugs he calls a chemical 
straitjacket that would give her the equilibrium to face her 
accusers in court 
attorney stephen colella said that only without the drugs would a 
jury see her insanity unmasked accurately reflecting his clients 
condition the day sindoni was killed 
several forensic psychiatrists questioned the ethics of colellas 
advice including dr bernard katz who teaches at boston university 
and harvard 
he called the medication spero would take mindrestoring not 
mindaltering and said he wondered about the welfare of such 
patients 
i feel its a bad investment on the part of any attorney who 
recommends this to a patient mental illness can be a very 
painful and troubling and extremely uncomfortable condition for many 
people he said 
in a recent interview colella said they argue that if shes 
not yelling and screaming therefore shes cured if the 
criminal charges were to go away she would still be a person who 
should be committed because shes a danger to herself and society 
colella backs his legal tactic with a 1981 decision by the state 
supreme judicial court that a psychiatric patient could refuse 
medication 
district attorney kevin burke disagrees with colella and 
persists in hoping a judge will find spero competent to stand trial 
so he can try her for murder 
but she cant be ordered to take antipsychotic drugs and at her 
annual reviews for mental competency a judge has continued 
hospitalization 
its in the best interest of justice to have this case tried 
burke said either this is a case of murder which we allege or 
we have a defendant who would be found not guilty by reason of 
insanity and the only way that will be resolved is through a 
trial 
for three years spero was incarcerated at the state prison for 
women at framingham until a judge ordered her moved to medfield 
state hospital 
spero was a student at the university of massachusetts at amherst 
when the killing occurred sindoni was attending hampshire college 
the two women had been friends about seven months and had shared a 
house with other women in northampton for a time 
spero had a history of mental troubles and checked into 
psychiatric hospitals on several occasions colella said 
speros arms are scarred with selfinflicted razor cuts and 
cigarette burns collela said she hears voices and hallucinates 
since her hospitalization at medfield doctors there said she also 
suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy colella said 
temporal lobe epilepsy for which spero takes medication is a 
psychologically debilitating illness that can cause sufferers to 
become suddenly angry or to exhibit other erratic behavior 
such attacks themselves would justify a defense of innocent by 
reason of insanity colella said 
but nobody knows the extent of speros problems over the years 
she has been diagnosed with a variety of mental illnesses a week 
before the slaying she sought psychiatric treatment but she left 
before being admitted to the center

the rev charles e curran will not appeal a 
judges ruling that the catholic university of america may bar him 
from teaching catholic theology because of his dissenting views on 
sexual ethics 
i have lost but the university its faculty and students may 
have lost more than i curran said after superior court judge 
frederick h weisberg ruled in catholics favor on all issues raised 
by curran in his landmark breach of contract lawsuit 
the district of columbia judge said the school has the right to 
make its own decisions in its struggle to balance its commitment to 
academic freedom with obedience to the vatican 
curran was strongly criticized by vatican officials for his 
positions on abortion homosexuality and other matters of sexual 
ethics during more than two decades teaching at catholic 
the courts opinion confirms what the university itself has 
asserted in this case that full academic freedom as understood in 
american higher education does not now exist at catholic 
university curran said 
i have fought for academic freedom at catholic university for 
more than 20 years he said i have lost as far as i am 
concerned this was the last battle 
curran maintained the university violated his contract when last 
april it stripped him of his canonical mission which the vatican 
requires to teach catholic theology 
that action came two years after the vatican declared curran was 
no longer suitable or eligible to teach catholic theology 
curran contended that the canonical mission requirement had 
fallen into disuse when he began teaching at catholic in 1965 he 
said a 1981 church rule making them mandatory didnt apply to him 
because it wasnt in effect when he joined the faculty 
the judge ruled that curran should have understood that his 
contract changed at that time requiring him to maintain a canonical 
mission 
weisberg also said the cua faculty handbook which by district of 
columbia law constitutes a contract does not specify that 
professors have full academic freedom 
curran said he feared the ruling would place limits on academic 
freedom in other catholic universities in america 
but university officials said they felt vindicated 
it doesnt surprise me to tell you the truth said the rev 
william byron president of the university this is really what i 
expected because we never breached his contract 
i regret that this ever came to litigation but its nice not 
to lose 
curran who remains a tenured professor at catholic but cannot 
teach there has taught as a visiting professor at cornell 
university and is currently at the university of southern california 
at los angeles 
byron said the offer remains open for curran to teach at catholic 
if he will accept an alternative assignment 
but curran said that will never happen its a matter of 
principle he said i could not do that

the agriculture departments preliminary 
figures for february show that prices farmers get for raw products 
declined 07 percent from their january average but still were 14 
percent above a year ago 
lower prices for soybeans lettuce milk and corn were mostly 
responsible for the decline from january the departments 
agricultural statistics board said tuesday higher prices for 
tomatoes strawberries potatoes and hay partly offset the decline 
in the other commodities 
prices of food grains increased from january to february while 
feed grains and oilseed prices decreased the report said the 
allwheat price moved to the highest level since april of 1981 but 
the average corn and soybean prices dropped from january to 
february 
tomato prices moved up sharply during the month and the february 
average for cattle and calves was the highest since may 1979 
the report also included revisions showing that prices received 
by farmers actually rose 28 percent from december to january 
instead of the 14 percent gain reported a month ago 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told congress meanwhile 
that the farm economy as a whole is continuing to make real 
progress in recovering from the hard times of the early and 
mid1980s 
last years drought helped reduce supplies of major crops 
including corn soybeans and wheat which has resulted in higher 
prices 
the higher prices have helped maintain a high cash income level 
for those farmers with supplies to sell and for the sector as a 
whole yeutter told the house budget committee 
however he added the drought dealt a severe blow to many 
producers in drought areas who lost much of their crop and who did 
not have prioryear crops to sell it also placed a heavy burden on 
livestock poultry and dairy producers who were faced with higher 
feed costs 
according to the preliminary february price figures based mostly 
on midmonth averages the index for livestock and livestock products 
as a group declined 06 percent from their january average but still 
were up 54 percent from february 1988 
the departments allcrops price index for february was down 14 
percent from january but averaged 27 percent above a year ago 
no new price figures for farm production costs were included in 
the february report those have been confined to quarterly averages 
because of budget cutbacks 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 48 
billion to 52 billion this year compared with a nearrecord of 57 
billion in 1988 that is the difference between cash receipts and 
cash expenses during the calendar year 
department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise 
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier 
production items 
food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 37 percent and 
usda analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is 
likely in 1989

president bush has announced his intention to 
appoint a californian jack c parnell to the no 2 post at the 
agriculture department 
parnell 53 has been director of the california state department 
of food and agriculture since 1987 and has been high on the 
preference list of agriculture secretary clayton yeutter to be 
deputy secretary 
reports had circulated last week that although yeutter favored 
parnell some officials at the white house were leaning toward former 
kentucky governor louie nunn yeutter however branded as totally

fbi efforts to end discrimination against 
blacks hispanics and women within the bureau will produce 
measurable results within a year director william s sessions says 
i have made it clear throughout the fbi not just to top 
management that all forms of discrimination are repulsive and will 
not be tolerated sessions told a house judiciary panel tuesday 
he told the subcommittee that he would fight not only hiring 
discrimination but racial harassment and a practice that hispanic 
fbi agents say has repeatedly blocked them from advancement within 
the bureau 
the hispanics say they are often thrown into stopgap roles for 
which spanishspeaking agents are needed and as a result miss out on 
indepth investigative experience that leads to promotion 
the fbi responsible for enforcing the nations civil rights 
laws has 8723 special agents of whom 419 are black 453 are 
hispanic 119 are of asian background and 40 are american indians 
sessions told the panel that represents an increase of 27 black 
agents and 54 hispanics since october 1987 
trainees not yet in the field are included however and fbi 
officials were unable to say immediately how many employees have 
been added overall since 1987 thus leaving unclear the percentage 
increase in minorities if any noted rep craig t james rfla 
we may have lost ground as far as agents in the field and may 
need to catch up james said 
we have a catchup program sessions said he said however 
that he would be able to present the lawmakers with measurable 
improvement over the current situation within a year 
discrimination suits against the bureau one brought by 238 
hispanic agents have resulted in disclosures of bias 
bureau recruiters have been barred from using the facilities at 
the university of michigan law school because of findings in the 
hispanic agents suit although sessions still plans to deliver the 
commencement address at the school this year 
members of congress are urging the fbi to settle the lawsuits 
quickly 
they have in my opinion been embarrassing said rep james f 
sensenbrenner jr rwis he urged sessions to get these problems 
behind us because in my opinion we all have more important things 
to do 
sessions said he would increase the authority of the fbis equal 
employment opportunity chief and give the official direct personal 
access to me upon request if managers balk at proposed changes 
he said the eeo officer will be instructed to come directly to 
me 
there will be no ambiguity about the role of this new office in 
the fbi sessions said 
problems in local offices should be directed to resident eeo 
counselors swiftly sessions said he promised steps to make these 
counselors some of whom have come under criticism more 
responsive to the needs of their peers

the united states has decided to call home 
three of the six minesweeping ships it deployed to the persian gulf 
during the height of fighting between iran and iraq defense sources 
say 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said tuesday the state 
department already had begun notifying friendly nations in the 
region of the decision 
the pentagon now expects the three minesweepers to depart the 
gulf by the middle of march the sources added 
the ships are being withdrawn because the threat has really 
lessened since a ceasefire took effect last august said one 
ranking pentagon official 
but were not withdrawing all of them because there is still an 
occasional floater underwater mine out there were scaling back 
at what we deem a prudent pace 
the decision to halve the number of minesweepers in the region 
comes as american allies such as england and italy are calling home 
their naval forces and when the us navy has stopped sidebyside 
escorts for convoys of oil tankers 
it also comes as the joint chiefs of staff debate a proposal to 
stop paying danger pay to us sailors working inside the persian 
gulf and as kuwait prepares to drop american registry for six of 
the 11 tankers that the navy had been protecting 
we dont see any of the real issues being settled between iran 
and iraq in peace talks but on the other hand we dont see the 
truce breaking down either said one administration official 
so everybody continues to scale back 
in a related development the fourstar general who heads the 
us central command told congress on tuesday that the soviet union 
was attempting to curry greater favor with and influence over 
iran 
there are signs that their relations are already improving 
said gen h norman schwarzkopf the head of the command responsible 
for us forces in the middle east 
it is important that we avoid a precipitous drawdown of us 
military forces that would send the wrong signal as regards the 
united states commitment to sustaining peace in the region 
schwarzkopf told the senate appropriations defense subcommittee 
the united states must not lessen interest in the region nor 
permit that perception to develop 
the defense sources said tuesday they expected the three 
minesweepers that would be recalled would be the ones deployed from 
the west coast the esteem conquest and enhance the other three 
ships the fearless inflict and illusive traveled to the region 
from ports on the east coast 
the korean warvintage craft were ordered to the gulf in the 
summer of 1987 shortly after the reflagged kuwaiti tanker bridgeton 
struck a mine while steaming in a us convoy the ships did not 
arrive until november 1987 however because they were towed across 
the pacific and atlantic to hold down engine wear 
the navy has been criticized for its slow pace in replacing the 
aging minesweepers with a more capable modern minesweeping vessel 
but the six ships have found and neutralized a number of suspected 
iranian mines 
the administration of former president ronald reagan agreed in 
the spring of 1987 to extend american military protection to 11 
kuwaiti tankers after they reregistered under the stars and 
stripes kuwait a friend of the united states and a key ally of 
iraq had seen its ships become a special target of iranian forces 
after eight years of fighting iran and iraq finally agreed to a 
truce last august and to date the ceasefire has held

a supreme court ruling allowing cities to be 
sued for monetary damages in some cases is being called a moderate 
decision that will protect local treasuries against bankrupting 
negligence judgments 
lynn branham a professor at the thomas m cooley law school in 
lansing mich who has studied the case called tuesdays ruling 
a moderate middleoftheroad approach 
she said municipalities still have some protection because mere 
negligence will not suffice but individuals are protected and on 
occasion can reach into a city treasurys deep pockets to recover 
for violations of their rights 
the justices ruled unanimously that local governments may be 
forced to pay when their deliberate indifference lets 
inadequately trained employees violate someones rights 
but in a case from canton ohio the court set tough standards 
that are expected to head off a wave of successful lawsuits 
nationwide 
justice byron r white writing for the court said a city or 
town cannot be held legally accountable when an inadequately trained 
public employee violates someones rights unless the harm is 
directly linked to the citys deliberate indifference 
white said creating any lessstringent standard of proof would 
open local governments to unprecedented liability and saddle 
federal courts with an endless exercise of secondguessing 
municipal employeetraining programs 
past supreme court decisions make clear that a muchused federal 
civil rights law may not be invoked to sue a local government every 
time one of its employees violates someones rights 
the court previously had ruled that the local government is not 
liable unless the injury stemmed from some unconstitutional official 
policy 
in tuesdays ruling the court for the first time said a local 
governments valid official policy may be challenged successfully 
if the policy is subverted by inadequate training 
the decision is a setback but not a final defeat for canton 
officials who sought to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says police 
violated her rights by failing to get needed medical attention while 
she was in their custody 
geraldine harris sued canton over an april 26 1978 incident in 
which she was stopped for speeding while driving her teenage 
daughter to school 
the 52yearold woman repeatedly slumped to the stationhouse 
floor during a stay of 30 or 40 minutes but police officers did not 
call for medical help saying they believed mrs harris was merely 
excited and would calm down if left alone and permitted to see her 
family 
mrs harris later was diagnosed as suffering from stress 
reaction anxiety and depression she was hospitalized for a week 
and received subsequent outpatient treatment for the next year 
a jury awarded mrs harris 200000 after deciding that she 
unreasonably had been denied medical attention by police 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals although ordering a new 
trial in mrs harris case ruled that canton could be liable for 
monetary damages because its police officers were not trained 
adequately to summon medical help in such cases 
the justices returned mrs harris case to the 6th circuit court 
which can now order a new trial or dismiss the suit 
in other decisions the court 
ruled 63 that railroads and airlines may punish strikers by 
giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the 
job or return to work before the strike ends 
voted 90 in a case involving two canadian citizens with bank 
accounts in washington state to make it easier for the federal 
government to give tax information and financial records to a 
foreign government 
reinstated a convicted florida murderers death sentence ruling 
54 that he should have been barred from mounting a successful 
constitutional attack in federal courts

spring flooding is threatening the ohio and 
lower mississippi river basins and several areas along the canadian 
border while california and the missouri basin face the possibility 
of more drought the national weather service reports 
spring snowmelt conditions were detailed tuesday by the weather 
service in a report that agency scientist michael hudlow said 
presented hydrological extremes in various parts of the nation 
california faces the most crucial test in the next couple of 
months with the possibility of a third consecutive dry summer for 
the first time in this century 
on a national basis the potential for drought doesnt appear as 
severe as last summer said hudlow but there are some areas that 
definitely bear watching 
meanwhile portions of kentucky and other southern states have 
already experienced flooding and have saturated soil that could pose 
a continuing danger in the runoff season 
there also is potential for spring snowmelt flooding in northern 
north dakota wisconsin michigan minnesota new york and new 
england hudlow said 
in addition to california and the missouri valley the spectre of 
drought hangs over the boston and new york metropolitan areas and 
the delaware river valley said hudlow 
he noted that some potential good news was included with both 
the 30day and 90day weather outlooks indicating a chance for 
abovenormal moisture in california 
but that is not a guarantee and the mountain snowpack that 
provides most summer moisture to the golden state is well below 
normal californias reservoirs are already low following two dry 
years and in some parts of the state stream flow appears likely to 
fall to less than 20 percent of normal he said the weather over 
the next two months is critical hudlow said noting that by may the 
state enters a normally dry season 
hudlow the weather services director of hydrology rejected the 
suggestion that global greenhouse warming could be the cause of 
this dryness 
he attributed the conditions to the regular variability of 
climate as well as changes in the movement of the jet stream that 
steers storm systems in from the pacific ocean in addition he 
said unusually cold water conditions in the pacific are likely 
having an effect in reducing californias moisture 
the second area of potential drought is the missouri valley 
where last summers dryness lowered reservoir levels and damaged 
crops 
a lot hangs in the balance of the next few months for this 
area also said richard dibouno of the army corps of engineers 
he said the snow cover is about 84 percent of normal over the 
missouri valley but it would take five years of normal moisture to 
refill reservoirs depleted by the recent drought 
in addition he noted that the missouri is a major supplier of 
water to the lower mississippi so continued dry conditions could 
affect regions downstream 
southern florida also was cited by hudlow as a major dry area 
and the threat of water supply shortages also covers boston new 
york and the delaware river basin 
on the other side of the coin flooding already has occurred in 
the ohio and lower mississippi river valleys hudlow noted the 
ground is saturated in those areas and spring snowmelt could result 
in further flooding problems 
major storms could lead to flooding in areas from east texas 
eastward into the southern appalachian mountains and north to the 
ohio valley he said 
in addition a heavy snowpack poses the potential for dangerous 
flooding in drainage areas around lake superior westward through the 
upper mississippi rainy souris and red river basins 
flooding is also possible but less likely in the adirondack 
region of new york state the green mountains of vermont white 
mountains in new hampshire and in northern maine hudlow said

the postal service wants to zero in on 
directmail groups that try to look like the government and sound 
like the government in order to get consumers to open their 
checkbooks 
private fundraising appeals made to look as if they are from 
government agencies are among the biggest consumer complaints 
inadequately addressed by current law jack swagerty assistant 
chief postal inspector for criminal investigations told a senate 
governmental affairs subcommittee tuesday 
swagerty told the subcommittee on federal services at a hearing 
that he endorsed legislation introduced by sens john heinz rpa 
and david pryor dark requiring eyecatching lookalike mail 
to carry a clear notice on the envelope disclaiming any connection 
with the federal government 
the bill would deal with ads such as those that appear to come 
from the us mint from agencies offering surplus property or from 
the interior department offering some inside track for obtaining 
mining rights in public lands swagerty said 
currently the postal service can do little to stop thousands of 
pieces of mail it finds deceptive 
for example a private groups fundraising appeal that said 
important justice department request enclosed was not deemed 
illegal because the contents showed that it was not actually from 
the government said tim mahoney of the postal service 
under the proposed legislation the envelope as well as the 
contents would require a notice that it is a private solicitation 
under penalty of fines the bill would require a similar 
disclaimer for envelopes with officiallooking seals or colors and 
for organizations with importantsounding names such as the 
federal record service 
the record service sent letters worded to intimidate 
unsuspecting parents into believing they must obtain a social 
security number for their newborn child sen joseph lieberman 
dconn told the panel he said the group charged 10 even though 
anyone can get a number from the government at no charge 
an entity called the social security protection bureau sponsored 
a 50000 sweepstakes prompting a confused constituent to ask heinz 
when the government got into the gambling business

two witnesses in the hijacking trial of fawaz 
younis said they and their families were uprooted from the middle 
east and given new identities to protect against possible terrorist 
reprisal for their testimony 
the lebanese passenger and jordanian flight attendant are among 
four witnesses who have so far identified younis as the leader of 
five heavily armed men who stormed aboard a royal jordanian airliner 
on june 11 1985 and held about 70 passengers and crew members 
hostage for 30 hours 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr instructed courtroom 
artists not to sketch the two witnesses as they testified tuesday 
two american passengers also have identified hijackers who took 
control of the airplane in an effort to publicize their efforts to 
force palestinian refugees to leave lebanon 
younis 30 has pleaded innocent to a sixcount sky piracy 
indictment the trial in us district court is a test of a 1984 law 
in which the united states asserts longarm jurisdiction over 
cases involving americans taken hostage overseas 
the protection given the witnesses and their families shows the 
lengths to which the government has gone to bring younis to trial 
beginning with his dramatic capture on a boat near cyprus two years 
after the hijacking 
one of the protected witnesses mouin ajam 24 said he 
originally went to jail for five days rather than testify i was 
concerned about the danger to my parents said ajam a lebanese 
who was one of the passengers 
ajam his wife and their infant son are living under new 
identities at an undisclosed location 
flight attendant sawson odetalleh 22 testified that federal 
authorities had moved her her mother sister brotherinlaw and 
five nieces and nephews to this country under new names to guard 
them against revenge 
if i would come out to testify in the usa i would be sure 100 
percent that it would jeopardize my family the jordanian native 
said 
miss odetalleh testified that shortly after the hijackers rushed 
onto the aircraft one demanded that she identify plainclothes 
jordanian security guards on board and asked a colleague to hand him 
a knife 
if you dont show me the marshals i will cut your fingers and 
make your face ugly she testified that the hijacker not younis 
told her 
later the same hijacker approached her with two hand grenades 
miss odetalleh testified 
this one will kill you this one will burn you which do you 
want she quoted him saying 
at another point the same hijacker placed her between himself 
and a window explaining that he wanted a shield in case snipers 
started firing and also wrote his nickname on her leg with a pen 
defense counsel francis d carter tried to show that ajam and 
miss odetalleh benefited from their agreements to testify against 
younis 
but they argued that they had sacrificed important parts of their 
lives in order to testify 
we cant see my parents they cant visit us they cant know 
where we are thats hard for the mothers ajam testified 
i left my memories i left my language said miss odetalleh 
it is hard to be in the witness program you start from zero 
more than two years after the hijacking younis was lured on 
sept 13 1987 to a sailboat and arrested in international waters 
13 miles off the coast of cyprus in the mediterranean sea testified 
david w johnson who led the team of a dozen fbi agents aboard the 
boat 
younis was interrogated for four days aboard the navy munitions 
ship uss butte and then flown to andrews air force base near 
washington johnson testified 
carter sought to convince the jury that the fbi coerced a 
confession from younis who was seasick and suffering from two 
broken wrists after his arrest

a boeing 747 front cargo door that may have 
popped open during a united airlines flight sending nine 
passengers to their deaths had a recent history of problems 
federal investigators said 
the national transportation safety board said tuesday that the 
navy had tracked a falling object it believed to be the cargo door 
on radar to a point 86 miles southsouthwest of honolulu where the 
ocean is 16800 feet deep 
the cargo door would be very helpful to us in our analysis 
ntsb investigator lee dickinson said at a latenight briefing 
although he did not know whether an attempt would be made to 
retrieve it 
meanwhile a similar united jumbo jet scheduled to land tuesday 
in honolulu from sydney australia was delayed 18 hours because of 
a faulty rear cargo door the airline said 
while the repair took only a short time it extended the 
allowable working time for the flight crew beyond the federal 
aviation adminstration limit so the flight was delayed until a 
rested crew was available a united spokesman said 
the forward cargo door on the 18yearold 747 that ripped open at 
22000 feet after leaving here for auckland new zealand on friday 
had electrical problems more than once in december and had to be 
closed manually said lee dickinson investigator for the national 
transportation safety board 
a seal on the same door was repaired in january he said 
at an ntsb news briefing monday night dickinson would not 
characterize the seriousness of the problems that were found by ntsb 
investigators by checking the aircrafts maintenance records 
united airlines spokesman rob doughty said the electrical 
problems are not considered serious and were on a list of deferred 
items that do not affect the airworthiness of the plane 
thats a list that includes things like a reading light not 
working he said 
as for the faulty door seal it is something that would be fixed 
before the plane was allowed to fly he said 
faa spokeswoman bobbie mardis in oklahoma city where the 
maintenance records are kept said the recent cargo door repairs 
were not listed on the jets service difficulty report possibly 
because they were minor or were completed recently and had not yet 
been logged 
faa records show that two other airlines reported faulty boeing 
747 cargo doors in the past five years 
one was on a pan american 747 that departed londons heathrow 
airport in march 1987 the airliner returned to the airport after 
the crew was unable to pressurize the cabin following takeoff 
according to the records 
a worn part on a cargo door latch was blamed for the problem 
in the other case the rear cargo door warning light blinked on a 
trans world airlines 747 during departure from ohare international 
airport in chicago in december 1983 ice on a master lock pin was 
the cause investigators said 
the united jets cockpit voice recorder indicates that the pilot 
capt david m cronin had no warning before the plane rapidly 
decompressed dickinson said 
on the recording the cockpit crew discussed only emergency 
procedures after the accident not a possible cause or warning he 
said cronin managed to turn the plane around and land safely in 
honolulu on only two of the four engines 
for cronin 59 the illfated flight 811 was to be his 
nexttolast before retirement according to his daughter karen 
twiggsmith who lives on the island of hawaii 
cronin a 34year veteran pilot with united told his daughter 
that he credits the heavenly father watching over him 
thats one of the first things he told me when i first talked 
to him she said 
united has refused to allow cronin and the other 17 crewmembers 
of flight 811 to talk publicly about the flight although he is 
expected to participate in a news conference in san francisco on 
thursday 
of the 354 people aboard the plane 27 were treated at hospitals 
mostly for minor injuries caused by flying debris two remained 
hospitalized tuesday both united crewmembers 
in washington aviation industry and government safety experts 
recommended tuesday that the federal aviation administration require 
800 million worth of mandatory work on older airliners to ensure 
safety of the nations aging airliner fleet 
the unprecedented program would affect more than 1300 early 
boeing 747 737 and 727 models at a cost of over 600000 each 
uniteds flight 812 from sydney which was delayed because of a 
rear cargo door problem was scheduled to arrive in honolulu at 110 
am tuesday according to uniteds reservations desk 
united spokesman sean mcnamara in sydney said engineers replaced 
a safety pin in the cargo door as a precaution in line with a 
company order to check all of the airlines aircraft 
the federal investigation of flight 811 has focused on the cargo 
door latching mechanism and airlines around the world took boeing 
cos advice and checked the cargo doors of their 747s 
what this is from us is by no means interfering or speculating 
on the probable cause of the accident boeing spokesman david 
jiminez said monday its more of a prudent act on our part to 
keep customers appraised of what we know 
uniteds headquarters in chicago issued a statement that more 
than 900 cargo doors in a fleet of 399 operational aircraft were 
inspected and seven repairs were required doughty said no repair 
was urgent and all would have been performed in normal maintenance

president bush says hes not bothered by the 
row over the chinese dissident who couldnt come to dinner and says 
he wont clear such social invitations in advance with the country 
hosting his visit 
discussing the communist governments decision to bar 
astrophysicist fang lizhi from attending a dinner he hosted in 
chinas capital city last weekend bush said he hoped that people 
wouldnt make too much over the incident 
thats not the whole question when it comes to the united 
states commitment to human rights the president said during a 
photo session while meeting with members of his cabinet 
asked whether the flap could have been averted if the us 
government had notified the communist government in advance of those 
invited to the texasstyle barbecue at the sheraton great wall hotel 
as the chinese have suggested bush said they may have a 
point that it might have been avoided 
but when asked if he would tell a communist host government ahead 
of time about invitations to dissidents he replied no and i 
think they understand that 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater defended bushs advocacy 
of human rights during the twoday visit to china but acknowledged 
there is some degree of difference between bushs handling of 
the issue and the way former president reagan dealt with it 
reagan met with dissidents during his visit to moscow in 1988 
and the former president often gave human rights a high profile 
during his public statements in foreign settings 
fitzwater said that bush believes he should push human rights in 
talks with communist leaders but that it should not be pursued to 
the exclusion of other concerns 
questions have been raised about how much emphasis bush will 
devote to human rights in the wake of the flap over fang 
fitzwater said that bush chose to voice his complaint quietly 
to chinese vice premier wu xuequian on monday the day after chinese 
police barred fang 52 from attending the event 
fitzwater said that bush does feel that there are any number of 
ways to call attention to our human rights policy but to make the 
views known diplomatically in a quiet way that does not disrupt or 
infringe on many of the other objectives that need to be raised with 
these countries 
so there is some degree of difference there fitzwater said 
but ill let you define it 
fitzwater said that bushs invitation to fang and a handful of 
other dissidents was intended to make a human rights statement and 
said that the president had pushed the issue in any number of 
ways 
i suppose maybe the proof is in the pudding in the sense that 
china today is saying the united states is to blame for the 
diplomatic row he said which is true which is to say that 
the president invited dissidents to this banquet for a reason 
four other dissidents attended the banquet but kept a low 
profile there

senators are asking edward j derwinski about 
his exposure of a south korean informant in a congressional bribery 
case but the nominee to run the new veterans affairs department 
says his nomination is proceeding well 
after almost two hours with the veterans affairs committee on 
tuesday derwinski said i dont see anything as a result of this 
meeting detrimental or negative 
the senior republican on the committee frank murkowski of 
alaska said the nominee was healthy and handles himself well 
but the chairman alan cranston dcalif declined comment 
the department is being formed on march 15 by elevation of the 
veterans administration to cabinet status derwinski has been 
nominated for both the jobs of administrator of the va and the 
secretary of the department 
derwinski was undersecretary of state for security assistance 
science and technology when president bush chose him in january to 
handle the veterans department 
derwinski also served 12 terms in the house as an illinois 
republican 
tuesdays session went over a 1977 episode in which derwinski 
tipped off the korean embassy that an agent of the korean central 
intelligence agency was about to defect to the united states 
derwinski at the time was a member of a house committee 
investigating the koreagate scandal bribes by the korean 
government for members of congress to ensure their support 
the agent sohn young ho was spirited away from his new jersey 
home by fbi agents just a halfhour before colleagues from the 
korean central intelligence agency arrived 
after his testimony he received a new identity in the 
governments protected witness program 
in 1978 derwinski denied being the source of the tip and 
declined to testify before a grand jury the house ethics committee 
did not pursue the matter saying that doing so would compromise 
intelligence sources and methods 
but in 1983 appearing before the senate foreign affairs

premier was a cigarette designed for people who 
hate cigarettes a butt that didnt cause cancer that didnt cloud 
the air with smoke that didnt even dribble ashes 
it also didnt taste very good and that apparently is what made 
the planned billion dollar project go up in smoke 
on tuesday rj reynolds tobacco co announced that after five 
months of test marketing in missouri and arizona it had snuffed out 
premier because it has not achieved adequate consumer acceptance 
during its short life premier neither satisfied cigarette 
smokers nor placated cigarette haters despite its label it was not 
exactly smokeless it gave off a steamy vapor reminiscent of 
cigarette smoke 
it was a clever bit of engineering so hightech that it was 
probably the first cigarette to come with instructions on how to 
smoke it 
its advantages seemed impressive it produced almost no tar so 
it probably did not cause lung cancer and no smoke curled off its 
lighted tip so nonsmokers were less likely to become upset 
but like many compromises this one seemed to please nobody to 
smokers it did not taste feel or look enough like a real 
cigarette and to doctors who worry about smokings effects this 
one was still a coffin nail because it almost certainly would have 
caused heart disease 
smokers who tried it complained it was hard to light it went 
out it did not burn down like a normal cigarette and it was hot to 
hold but worst of all was the flavor 
people smoke for taste its very bland and you have to draw 
until you get a headache to get any taste out of it at all said 
dave grinstead tobacco buyer for the shop amp save chain in missouri 
i thought the project initially was revolutionary in concept 
said analyst lawrence adelman of dean witter reynolds inc but the 
technology wasnt there yet to satisfy consumer requirements 
reynolds maintained that people needed to smoke two or three 
packs to develop a taste for premier but instead retailers said 
smokers often bought a pack smoked one or two passed around the 
rest and never came back for more 
doctors noted that even though premier lacked cancercausing tar 
it delivered nicotine and carbon monoxide like other cigarettes 
those things cause heart disease which is an even bigger smoking 
hazard than lung cancer 
given the fact that more people die from cardiovascular disease 
associated with smoking than from cancer its like comparing 
jumping from the 10th floor of a building with jumping from the 
seventh floor said dr gregory connolly director of the 
massachusetts office for nonsmoking and health 
dr dietrich hoffmann of the american health foundation a 
longtime opponent of cigarettes and member of a panel that reviewed 
reynolds scientific data on premier said the product represented 
some progress for those who cannot be turned off smoking 
while premier clearly seemed aimed at answering some of the major 
health complaints about cigarettes reynolds never actually made any 
health claims instead the brochure that came with a pack called it 
the cleaner smoke and said it reduced many of the 
controversial compounds found in ordinary cigarette smoke 
in fact reynolds could not flatly state that the new cigarette 
was safer that would have been an admission that regular cigarettes 
are unsafe something the tobacco industry has never acknowledged 
heres how premier worked instead of packed tobacco the end of 
the cigarette contained a round piece of charcoal behind the 
charcoal was an inchandaquarter long hollow aluminum capsule 
surrounded by tobacco inside the capsule were tiny beads containing 
dried tobacco glycerin and two secret flavorings 
when the smoker lit up and took a drag he sucked hot air through 
the metal capsule the heat vaporized the glycerin and nicotine in 
the dried tobacco as well as the flavorings the vapor then passed 
through two filters and into the smokers mouth 
analysts estimated the company spent about 325 million to 
develop and test market premier and reynolds had said a full 
nationwide launch would have raised the cost to 1 billion 
several analysts speculated that the timing of premiers demise 
was due to the recent buyout of rjr nabisco by kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co which needs to cut costs at rjr to pay off the debt 
it took on in the record 2453 billion takeover 
but others said premier was doomed no matter what 
i think the consumer reaction was so negative that it pretty 
much was a foregone conclusion adelman said

senate clean air supporters have promised to 
write a tough new antipollution bill by july 4 an announcement 
made while environmental experts were telling a house panel that 
healthy adults and children are now at risk from dirty air 
the house energy and commerce health subcommittee was told 
tuesday that the nation faces a health emergency with 150 million 
americans now living in areas with unsafe levels of ozone and carbon 
monoxide 
dr philip j landrigan representing the american academy of 
pediatrics and the american public health association said children 
are especially vulnerable to air pollution because their airways are 
more narrow than those of adults and because of their increased 
frequency of respiratory infections 
he said studies of children in summer camps show those exposed to 
ozone at concentrations even below current allowable levels 
developed temporary respiratory problems 
childrens often high levels of activity put them at risk for 
acute respiratory effects due to ozone exposure landrigan said 
dr thomas godar representing the american lung association 
said americans mistakenly accept dirty air as one of the facts of 
life 
ozone can cause immediate shortterm changes in lung function 
and increased respiratory symptoms in healthy adults and children 
who exercise moderately or heavily during periods of elevated ozone 
concentrations he said 
significant decreases in lung function and symptoms such as 
coughing and pain are experienced by exercising individuals 
exposed to ozone for one to two hours at levels comparable to those 
frequently found in unsafe air quality areas he said 
sen max baucus dmont who will sponsor the senates clean air 
bill this year announced that sections of the legislation will be 
introduced at these time intervals toxic air pollutants april 3 
new air quality standards including controls on auto emissions may 
1 and acid rain control june 1 
he said a complete bill should be written before congress july 4 
recess 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine sponsor of 
clean air legislation that died last year told senators 
americans are suffering from a manmade phenomenon that can be 
controlled we have developed the technologies of control we have 
the resources to apply those technologies until now we have lacked 
the political will to do so we must now develop that will 
clean air legislation has been stalled for a decade as 
supporters of industry and environmental groups and different 
regions of the country have fought to a standstill 
only one witness at the house hearing representing general 
motors said that there was no conclusive evidence that current air 
quality levels caused lasting health problems 
the chief of general motors research laboratories dr 
christopher c green said the potential health effects from 
exposure to current levels of ozone and carbon monoxide have been 
the subject of considerable overstatement 
the environmental protection agency said 62 areas have failed to 
meet air quality standards for ozone and 59 for carbon monoxide a 
list based on readings from 1985 to 1987 the list does not yet 
include 28 cities that exceeded the safe ozone levels last summer 
according to epa data

in lobbying senators to support john tower for 
secretary of defense president bush has the difficult task of 
overcoming the reputation sen sam nunn has built over the past 16 
years as the senates bipartisan leader on defense issues 
thats probably the toughest single obstacle the president 
faces sen charles robb dva said tuesday 
nunn a georgia democrat who has been chairman of the senate 
armed services committee since 1986 and a member of the panel since 
1973 led the committees democrats in a 119 partyline vote last 
week to reject the tower nomination 
since then he has made the case against tower on national 
television in private meetings with other senators and in the 
written report of the armed services committee but he insisted 
tuesday that he has not been strongarming anybody to vote 
against tower 
im not saying my prestige is on the line said nunn who has 
been described by senate majority leader george mitchell as one of 
if not the most respected members of the senate 
i give them my views and i dont make any bones about where i 
stand nunn said but im not asking them to vote on anything 
other than their conscience 
nunns views are that the fbi report on tower provides evidence 
of a clear pattern of alcohol abuse and that the former texas 
senators recent work as a highpaid consultant to defense 
contractors raises serious conflictofinterest questions 
those views carry substantial weight primarily because of nunns 
reputation among both democrats and republicans as a senator who 
does his homework and who speaks with authority on defense issues 
i have never known him to do anything in congress that would 
appear to have selfserving narrow political implications when 
dealing with national defense or foreign policy former alabama 
sen jeremiah denton said tuesday 
denton a conservative republican who served on the armed 
services committee with both nunn and tower said he supports tower 
for secretary of defense but unlike some republicans does not 
believe nunns opposition is motivated by partisan politics 
nunn has resisted republican efforts to paint the tower 
nomination as a partisan fight waged by the democraticcontrolled 
congress in an effort to weaken the new president 
the republicans if you agree with them they say youre a 
patriot but if you disagree all of a sudden its partisan said 
nunn who during the reagan years consistently ranked as one of the 
senates top democratic supporters of the republican president 
nunn said he realized when tower was nominated that he would be 
subjected as committee chairman to a barrage of criticism 
regardless of whether he supported or opposed the nomination 
either i would be the scapegoat because i was taking on the 
president or i would be the chairman of the armed services 
committee covering up the alleged transgressions of the nominee 
he said 
the criticism intensified tuesday when the wall street journal 
reprinted a dec 4 1972 article from the atlanta journal detailing 
an oct 31 1964 automobile accident in which nunn pleaded guilty 
to leaving the scene of an accident 
in an accompanying article the newspaper said if the senate 
is entitled to pass judgment on john towers personal history then 
the public is also entitled to know the salient facts about those 
who judge mr tower 
nunn acknowledged that his driving and judgment were impaired 
on the evening of the accident because he had too much to drink but 
he said an accident 24 years ago is not relevant to the tower 
nomination 
the implication is that if i have an automobile accident in 
1964 then im not qualified under the constitution to render advice 
and consent in 1989 nunn said i dont think that logic holds

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says he 
is still looking for areas to reduce his budget by 11 billion but 
believes most of the money will come from commodity programs 
president bush has called for the reduction but not specified 
which programs should be cut leaving congress with only reagan 
administration proposals 
yeutter assured the house budget committee on tuesday he was not 
wedded to the reagan proposals 
for example he said ground water and food programs cut in the 
proposed reagan budget will be restored 
he said farmers home administration programs and those of the 
rural electrification administration however will be reduced along 
with commodities 
after the hearing yeutter told reporters that cuts in 
commodities wouldnt be arbitrary 
we have to go through a sophisticated analysis to determine the 
extent of the changes it may vary from commodity to commodity he 
said 
we have to decide the best way to achieve the reduction while 
still keeping a safety net for farmers its not an easy trick he 
said 
he mentioned cutting target prices but said they may not be cut 
by the same percentage for every commodity he also suggested that 
there may be a reduction in permitted acreage 
yeutter told committee members who asked specifically about the 
school lunch program that it was unlikely to see any reduction 
though president reagan had suggested it be cut by 950 million 
the secretary said he wanted to evaluate it and all nutrition 
programs run by the department but he doubted that there would be 
any cuts in them 
rep dale kildee dmich gave yeutter a list of programs for 
lowincome americans which he said the committee over the years has 
agreed must never be cut including school lunch and other child 
nutrition programs 
an area yeutter said should get more money is the export 
enhancement program 
export expansion and longterm market development are of key 
importance to us agriculture he told the committee 
discussing the ongoing negotiations under the general agreement 
on trade and tariffs known as gatt yeutter said the united states 
is still committed to removing trade barriers worldwide 
but he said the difficulty in achieving that end was demonstrated 
at the midterm review of the uruguay round last december in montreal 
when the united states was unable to get other countries to go along 
with its desire to do away with government subsidies 
following a meeting with yeutter on monday australian trade 
chief john duffy said the united states had softened its position 
and put the ball very much in the european communitys court 
yeutter said after the hearing tuesday that duffy was correct in 
saying that the ball was in the hands of the ec but said the united 
states had not softened 
we formulated our proposal in a more palatable way yeutter 
said 
trade talks resume in geneva in april

president bush has scrapped a planned trip to 
his family retreat in maine this month because of an impending birth 
in the first family 
you just dont travel those last few days insisted first 
lady barbara bush who said she told the president to forget about 
plans for a preeaster visit to kennebunkport maine 
and that was that 
the family dog mildred k or millie an english springer 
spaniel is expecting and due sometime between march 15 and 20 
while awaiting the new canine arrival mrs bush says she plans 
to ride around the white house grounds on one of the two new 
flying pigeon bicycles that she and the president were presented 
during their visit last week to beijing 
its the same kind of bike that she and bush used to ride in the 
mid1970s when they lived in the chinese capital where cars are few 
and most people get around on bikes 
the president was head of the us mission there from 197475 
the oval on the south lawn of the white house is exactly one 
quarter mile mrs bush said she said it was a good place to use 
the new bicycle 
when they were presented with the gift bikes chinese premier li 
peng suggested that that the bushes ride the bikes around the white 
house grounds 
the president who gave li a pair of black texas boots in return 
said he and mrs bush would probably ride the bicycles in 
kennebunkport 
li indicated that the boots boasting flags of the united state 
and china probably would not get as much of a workout he said it 
wasnt a custom in china to go around with boots bearing flags but 
he might wear them if he ever visited the united states

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan defends 
his decision to fight inflation with higher interest rates even 
though the bush administration disagrees with the central banks 
reading of the economy 
greenspan told the senate budget committee on tuesday that the 
current inflation rate is not doing clear significant corrosive 
harm to the economy at the moment 
but it has built into it the seeds of an acceleration that if 
not dampened can become very damaging he said in his first 
public statement since the federal reserve escalated its 
antiinflation fight friday by increasing a key bank lending rate 
he said the central bank expects inflation to increase this year 
to the 45 percent to 5 percent range up about half a percentage 
point from last year 
however fed policy makers are worried that a pickup in wage 
increases and rising material costs will cause businesses and 
consumers to include the expectation of inflation in their plans 
when that happens prices will rise faster he said 
our basic goal is to make sure that inflation does not 
accelerate inordinately and ultimately phases down he said 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady in testimony before the 
house budget committee softened previous criticism of federal 
reserve tightening but he did not retract his statement that the 
administration sees less danger of inflation 
its two people looking at the same statistic and coming to a 
slightly different conclusion brady said 
greenspan while not explicitly acknowledging the 
administrations comments said in response to a question from sen 
william l armstrong rcolo i think i get it from all sides 
in the budget committee sen william armstrong rcolo and 
sen james exon dneb praised the fed for its stance toward 
inflation but sen don nickles rokla told greenspan im 
afraid youre laying the seeds for a recession 
sen pete domenici rnm said he believed the feds strategy 
of gradual increases in interest rates would not work and that far 
more ratcheting down of the economy will be needed to achieve the 
feds stated goal of zero inflation 
youve got to almost create a selffulfilling prophecy and 
create a recession he said 
brady greenspan and white house budget director richard darman 
who spoke to the senate appropriations committee all said that 
congress and the administration can help the fed curb inflation and 
also permit interest rates to drop by agreeing on a credible plan to 
cut the budget deficit 
greenspan said president bushs budget if adopted would trigger 
lower interest rates even if it eventually produced a deficit higher 
than the 100 billion grammrudman target for 1990 
i may say i would like to see grammrudmanhollings targets met 
literally but i dont think that is required to bring a 
significant reduction in interest rates he said 
if after the fact the real number is 110 billion or 120 
billion in that vein i would think that would be a major 
improvement which the markets would take very positively the 
federal reserve chairman said 
but the reduction from the 1989 deficit of about 165 billion 
must not be accomplished with accounting tricks and must hold out 
the reasonable prospect for further reductions he said 
what cannot have a positive effect is finding some set of 
bookkeeping gimmicks which largely meet grammrudman for fiscal 1990 
and then paper over 91 92 93 he said

the government confirms the drought helped 
increase the cancercausing fungus aflatoxin in the 1988 corn crop 
in the midwest requiring some corn to be diverted to feed nondairy 
cattle 
but the government disputed concerns raised in a report by the 
wall street journal last week that aflatoxintainted corn is moving 
through the nations food chain because of inadequate sampling and 
unreliable testing 
in a statement tuesday the food and drug administration said the 
agency does not believe such concern is warranted because there is 
plenty of aflatoxinfree corn available for human consumption and 
several layers of protection are in place 
aflatoxin is linked to the development of liver cancer in 
laboratory rats last years heat and drought provided ideal 
conditions for development of the fungus that produces aflatoxin 
primary concern has centered around possible contamination of the 
milk and corn supply 
the fda said the agency reaffirmed to state health officials last 
fall its aflatoxin limit of 05 parts per billion for milk 
states and the national conference on interstate milk shipments 
which has prime responsibility for testing milk expanded monitoring 
and as a result some milk in texas minnesota iowa and southern 
illinois had higher levels of aflatoxin than allowed and had to be 
dumped the fda said 
the level of aflatoxin allowed in corn is 20 parts per billion 
and about 6 percent 95 samples out of 1650 of the field corn 
tested in recent months had higher levels the fda said this corn 
cannot be used for human consumption but can be diverted to feed 
nondairy cattle the fda said 
in addition to fda testing which is concentrated in high risk 
areas tests are conducted by the us agriculture department and 
the states manufacturers and millers who buy corn for food products 
the fda also tested about 100 corn products on store shelves 
including cooked cereal dry cereal tortillas corn chips and 
popcorn and all were negative agency spokesman bill grigg said 
fda tested about 263 samples of corn flour and corn meal and 
found 2 percent or six samples to have more than 20 parts of 
aflatoxin per billion fda policy requires that these products be 
removed from the market

tests found excessive amounts of lead and 
barium in the water from drinking fountains in usa todays 
newsrooms but the cause of a high number of miscarriages among 
employees remains undetermined a spokeswoman for the newspaper says 
employees were notified of the levels in excess of the 
environmental protection agencys guidelines in a memo distributed 
monday spokeswoman sheila gibbons said 
but there was such a disparity in the levels of lead and barium 
in the tests that the newspaper has asked for a new series of tests 
of the drinking water ms gibbons said tuesday 
ms gibbons said the water tests are part of an overall 
environmental check which began a few months ago when the newspaper 
owned by gannett co inc learned informally that a large number of 
pregnant women on its staff had miscarried 
we are looking at several things in the newsroom environment 
she said preliminary tests have been made on building materials 
and carpeting as well as the water 
so far there has been nothing conclusive she said 
concerns over the miscarriage rate at the newspapers 
headquarters here surfaced more than two months ago after an 
informal survey found that 14 women who work on the 14th and 15th 
floors of the building had suffered miscarriages since september

leroy w dubeck hopes that giant ants and 
maneating plants will soon invade the nations classrooms but the 
physics professor insists hes no mad scientist bent on revenge his 
only gripe is ignorance 
with international comparisons showing us students dead last in 
scientific knowledge the temple university professor believes 
american youngsters might profit from spending some classroom time 
studying science fiction film thrillers 
the purpose is to tell kids that this thing called science can 
be fun and it can help me understand the world around me said 
dubeck in a telephone interview 
he has published a 185page curriculum science in cinema 
teaching science fact through science fiction films consisting of 
lesson plans exploring the scientific truths and falsehoods in 10 
scifi films that dubeck and coauthors suzanne e moshier and 
judith e boss say have proven excellent for teaching science 
the curriculum published by columbia teachers college press was 
field tested in a dozen philadelphia area schools in 198788 test 
results of the 398 students exposed to the scifi curriculum showed 
that youngsters came away with a better understanding of scientific 
process and felt more positive about science 
the greatest impact was on attitudes said matthew bruce 
professor of science education at temple who conducted the testing 
children are turning off to science in droves this curriculum 
could retard that although in and of itself it probably cant 
reverse it 
films in the curriculum were selected for their cinematic 
quality their availability on videocassettes and their ability to 
trigger discussions of scientific issues 
for example the immensely popular star wars isnt much good 
for teaching science 
too much of it is fantasy said dubeck it gets all hung up 
with reincarnation and the force 
but students can get a new twist on astronomy and physics from 
forbidden planet the 1956 classic can a spaceship possibly 
travel faster than the speed of light where does robby the robot 
get his incredible energy 
the andromeda strain a 1970 film about a killer microbe from 
outer space could generate discussions about the problems 
scientists are having in conquering aids 
students can learn about plant life from the day of the 
triffids a 1963 british offering featuring maneating mutant 
plants from outer space 
and them a chilling 1954 film about a world of giant ants 
depicts accurately the habits of real ants and can get students 
talking about whether radiation could possibly create such mammoth 
mutations 
other films in the curriculum included the day the earth caught 
fire destination moon when worlds collide the day the 
earth stood still five million years to earth and 
colossus the forbin project 
dubeck a science fiction buff who owns copies of more than 250 
such films has taught a course on science science fiction and 
film at temple since 1977 and thought the idea might work for 
high school students as well 
with 162000 in grants from the national science foundation the 
new curriculum was tried in 13 philadelphiaarea public and 
parochial high schools and one middle school last year dubeck and 
moshier a professor of biology at the university of nebraska 
trained 24 high school science teachers to use the curriculum during 
the summer of 1987 
multiple choice exams at the beginning and end of the school year 
showed that 80 percent of the 398 students in classes using science 
fiction films outscored 373 students in ordinary classes in science 
knowledge knowledge of scientific process and in attitudes toward 
science careers 
classes using the curriculum saw four to six films during the 
year mixed in with traditional science education in no case did 
the films and accompanying discussions take up more than 5 percent 
of total class time dubeck said 
perhaps above all wrote dubeck many science fiction films 
depict science as solving problems rather than causing them 
students often perceive chemistry simply as the cause of pollution 
and physics connotes the risk of nuclear accidents 
if science seems to many to have failed in the real world he 
wrote it still offers hope and fulfillment of dreams in science 
fiction

drug use among high school seniors is 
declining even though more than half of all students still had used 
an illegal drug at least once according to a new report 
the news is very encouraging said charles r schuster 
director of the national institute on drug abuse which sponsored 
the study but we dont want to imply that the war is won 
the problem is there are still pockets primarily among those 
who have dropped out of high school where drug use remains at very 
high levels he said 
some 16300 high school seniors from 135 schools nationwide were 
polled in the survey 
the survey which has been conducted every year since 1975 found 
that the share of high school seniors who reported having ever used 
an illegal drug dropped from 566 percent in 1987 to 539 percent in 
1988 thats the lowest level recorded since the survey began when 
the rate was 552 percent 
peak illegal drug use occurred in 1981 when 656 percent of 
seniors reported having indulged at least once according to the 
survey 
the proportion of seniors who reported using an illegal drug 
within the previous year dropped from 417 percent in 1987 to 385 
percent in 1988 and the percentage reporting use within the 
previous 30 days dropped from 247 percent to 213 percent in the

because of a labeling error the company and the food and drug 
administration said 
dtp vaccine is used routinely to immunize infants and children 
against diphtheria tetanus and whooping cough 
the recall was begun because four vials of equine influenza 
found in a plant warehouse were mislabeled as dtp vaccine equine 
influenza vaccine is used in immunizing horses against several 
strains of flu 
as a safety precaution the company notified 1865 customers to 
return all vials with the lot number 8m91039 
the fda said less than 20000 of the 46000 vials in the lot were 
actually shipped to doctors pharmacists and distributors nationwide 
fda commissioner frank e young in a statement said the 
labeling error is not believed to constitute a health hazard because 
connaught officials believe they have located the only mislabeled 
vials 
parents should not be unduly alarmed nor should they interrupt 
their childrens immunization schedules but we feel that the action 
of the company to recall the marketed vaccine is prudent dr

bryant gumbel who has snipped at david 
letterman connie chung and linda ellerbee and others is at it 
again this time firing a rocket at fellow today show staffers 
such as willard scott and gene shalit 
in a 6monthold memo made public by new york newsday on tuesday 
he accused weatherman scott of holding nbcs toprated morning talk 
hostage to his bad taste he said consumer advocate david 
horowitz is a walking cliche he said shalits movie reviews are 
often too late and his interviews not very good 
medical correspondent art ulenes theme weeks were dubbed 
boring and many of new yorkbased consumer correspondent betty 
furness reports too local 
jane pauley escaped mention 
her cohost who wrote the memo last august when he was 
negotiating his threeyear 7 million contract could not be 
reached for comment tuesday because he was on vacation 
its not the first time gumbels grumbles have made news in a 
september issue of sports illustrated he recounted his 
disenchantment with chung ellerbee and letterman among others 
even pauley who keeps a scrupulously happy face seemed 
exasperated by gumbels longtime war of words with the host of 
nbcs late night which stemmed from lettermans bullhorn 
disruption of a primetime today special during an interview 
with don johnson and philip michael thomas of miami vice 
letterman shouted from an upper floor of the nbc building im 
larry grossman president of nbc news and im not wearing pants 
nbcs producer later confirmed that the bit had been arranged 
though not cleared with the today stars pauley said even she 
wasnt angry at letterman and she was the one doing the interview 
when the disruption occurred not gumbel 
that didnt keep gumbel from launching and continuing a feud with 
letterman that escalated to the point of gumbel questioning 
lettermans manhood during a news conference last summer letterman 
has since said the feud is a joke but anyone whos seen gumbel 
discuss the matter would be hard to convince 
scott was the target of gumbels toughest jabs 
this guy is killing us and no ones even trying to rein him 
in gumbel complained and suggested nuking the assistant who 
supplies scott with viewers birthdates for scotts birthday 
greetings to centenarians 
scott called gumbels comments old stuff 
its all water over the dam scott said i dont think hes 
a happy man were all here to have fun and make money 
shalit said i love what i do and im proud of my work people 
always have something to say in any creative organization it 
doesnt bother me besides i think bryant is a terrific guy 
furness said she reports only on stories that are of national 
interest ulene said gumbel is a smart guy about television though 
he apparently doesnt understand the importance to viewers of say 
cholesterol week horowitz said he stands on his record 
gumbel also griped to executive producer marty ryan about ryans 
alleged lack of guidance and a lack of willingness to stand on 
folks and make sure they do whats necessary 
ryan who was the recipient of the memo told newsday it was 
stolen out of a computer file and that bryant and i always 
have candid exchanges about the show 
nbc news president michael g gartner declined to comment but 
was supportive of ryan in his regular weekly interoffice newsletter 
to the staff 
gartner has his share of negative press coming an article in 
marchs manhattaninc magazine due on newsstands thursday says 
many at nbc news fear gartner who signed on last summer is a 
shortterm hatchet man brought in by budgetconscious parent 
corporation ge 
gartners most visibletoviewers action so far was to 
consolidate nbcs ballyhooed new sunday today with meet the 
press a move credited with prompting former nbc white house 
correspondent chris wallace one of nbcs few bigname news stars 
to jump to abc

severely deformed babies facing certain death 
should not be routinely considered as organ donors even though 
hundreds of children desperately need new hearts and livers the 
national transplant network said 
directors of the united network for organ sharing adopted a 
policy tuesday discouraging at least for now use of anencephalic 
infants as organ donors the board noted however it is unwise to 
recommend a moratorium 
the issue of whether to take organs from anencephalic infants 
babies born without most of their brains has troubled experts for 
some time but some say it is the only way to save other dying 
babies and children for whom there are few organs 
were certainly not going to take organs from a live person 
but in our hearts and in our minds we know these people are not 
alive said brian broznick director of the pittsburgh transplant 
foundation and a proponent of anencephalic donors 
broznick and many other procurement officials are distressed that 
they must refuse organs from anencephalic infants until all brain 
activity ceases by then the organs often are not fit for 
transplantation due to infection 
anencephalic infants are born with only part of a brain stem 
which controls respiration because they do have slight brain stem 
activity they are not legally brain dead a necessary state before 
organs can be removed from a human body 
half the 1000 to 2000 anencephalic babies delivered each year 
in the united states are stillborn the other half generally die 
within one week 
not all parents would do it donate said art caplan 
director of the center for biomedical ethics at the university of 
minnesota but im sure there would be a significant number of 
donors 
broznick in fact believes there probably would be enough organs 
to accommodate the 400 to 500 children awaiting liver transplants in 
this country 
we could probably take care of all those kids and we cant do 
anything about it he said by the same token we could offer 
this couple with an anencephalic baby an opportunity for something 
positive to come out of this life that theyve tried to bring in 
its a real sad situation 
only one anencephalic child has ever had its organs removed for 
transplantation in the united states that case occurred on oct 16 
1987 at loma linda university medical center in california 
the heart recipient a boy who was born the day of the operation 
is doing well at home in british columbia said loma linda 
spokeswoman anita rockwell 
the hospital has had a moratorium since august on cases involving 
infants suffering from the incurable birth defect however 
anencephalic infants reportedly have been used as organ donors in 
canada europe and japan 
because of the growing interest in the infants as donors the 
united network for organ sharings ethics committee began studying 
the matter last year the panel recently presented its 
recommendation to the networks 32member board of directors which 
adopted the position during a regular meeting tuesday in new orleans 
the board said further study is needed and could prompt a 
reevaluation of its position 
we must have agreement on how you diagnose death and 
braindeath in anencephalic infants before we can go any further 
said caplan an ethics committee member 
the virginiabased united network administers the national organ 
procurement and transplantation network

criminal investigation spokesman al albergate said tuesday 
miss taylor admitted in a 1987 magazine interview that she had 
undergone treatment for addiction to painkillers and alcohol a call 
to miss taylors publicist wasnt answered after hours tuesday 
albergate said the investigation involves allegations that at 
least two doctors during the past year prescribed excessive amounts 
of various opiates barbiturates and stimulants to her without 
medical justification 
he did not identify the drugs or the doctors nor did he say when

office albergate said 
we are not commenting on it in any way said alan ashby a 
spokesman for the attorney generals office he did say that a 
recent law requiring doctors to submit drug forms to the state 
justice department makes it possible to monitor prescription drug 
usage more carefully 
miss taylor who turned 57 monday was honored last thursday in 
palm springs for her philanthropic work she addressed speculation 
about her health saying she fractured her back last summer and it 
took a long time to heal 
but im fine now she said 
her appearance followed a monthlong seclusion that spawned 
rumors that she had gained weight and underwent treatment for drug 
or alcohol abuse 
her publicist chen sam said recently that miss taylor was 
suffering back pain and had been admitted to st johns medical 
center in santa monica for xrays 
miss taylor hurt herself in june when she fell on the set of the 
film young toscanini in rome she has suffered recurring back 
problems since childhood when she fell off a horse during the 
filming of national velvet 
in a 1987 interview miss taylor said she would have died had she 
not sought treatment for her use of demerol and alcohol 
she won best actress oscars in 1960 for butterfield 8 and in

riot police overpowered and arrested 28 
leading dissidents who tried to reach the north korean border today 
for talks with communist officials on reuniting the divided korean 
peninsula 
police seized the dissidents after a sixhour standoff on the 
main highway from seoul to the panmunjom border truce site they 
forced their way onto the dissidents bus and took them to a nearby 
police station 
get away get away some of the dissidents shouted as they 
were taken off the bus at the station dissident leader lee jaeoh 
and some other protesters kicked and punched police trying to take 
them away 
the radical united national democratic movement of korea had sent 
delegates to try and reach the border truce site for talks with 
north korean officials on reuniting the peninsula that has been 
divided since 1945 
north korean radio in a report monitored in tokyo said its 
delegates waited at panmunjom for two hours for the dissidents it 
accused the south korean and us governments of blocking 
reunification 
indiscriminate violence by the south korean rulers at the 
us imperialists instigation is unbearable undemocratic and an 
act counter to unification the radio said 
south and north korean officials are to meet thursday at 
panmunjom to try and work out terms for a meeting between their 
prime ministers which would be the highest level contact ever 
between the two koreas 
dissident leaders reject the seoul governments efforts to ease 
tension with the north and earlier announced plans to conduct their 
own talks north korea backed the dissidents in an apparent move to 
embarass seoul 
lines of riot police with shields blocked the main highway from 
seoul today when the dissidents bus reached the naeyu checkpoint 12 
miles from the border 
troopers with shields immediately surrounded the bus to stop 
dissidents from getting off and the protesters stayed aboard for 
about six hours partly blocking the highway 
angry dissident leaders leaning from the bus windows repeatedly 
denounced the united states charging that washington keeps troops 
in the south to prop up the seoul government and perpetuate division 
of the peninsula 
withdraw americans blocking unification the dissidents 
chanted 
a dissident leader read a statement denouncing south korean 
president roh taewoos government and charging that it does not 
want union with the north 
roh has been holding talks with north korea on improving 
relations as part of a major initiative to reduce tensions on the 
peninsula 
the government and the usa if they really want peaceful 
unification of the nation should not use force in blocking us 
the dissident spokesman said 
south korean dissidents are demanding immediate reunification 
with the communist north claiming all the souths political 
problems stem from the peninsulas division 
in seoul today roh delivered one of his strongest warnings yet 
to radicals and dissidents saying south korea can no longer tolerate 
attempts to overthrow its democratic system 
we have reached a stage where we can no longer tolerate 
attempts to topple the government through class revolution he 
said in a speech marking the 70th anniversary of a nationwide 
uprising against japanese colonial rule 
all of us who share responsibility in this land must take a 
clearcut attitude toward antidemocracy groups that shake our free 
society from its very foundation he said 
dissidents were blocked tuesday near the panmunjom border site 
when they tried to meet with north korean officials to make 
arrangements for todays planned meeting us military border 
guards were involved in the scuffle 
the united states has about 42000 troops in south korea under a 
mutual defense treaty

richard m daley owner of the most famous last 
name in chicago politics rarely invoked his fathers memory during 
his democratic mayoral primary campaign but with his victory 
secure he made sure to pay his dues 
today when i was walking down to vote with my wife when i 
looked up i know he was looking down on me daley said tuesday 
night of sixterm mayor richard j daley 
in unofficial returns the younger daley garnered 57 percent of 
the vote in the primary to oust mayor eugene sawyer and move to the 
april 4 general election 
the elder daley was the boss of bigcity machine politics the 
purveyor of patronage the last of a political breed dying in 1976 
three months into his third decade in office 
his son who often sat in the mayors seat as a youngster 
recalled that his father had told him that in politics youre 
going to have ups and downs youre going to win youre going to 
lose 
and despite the sterling showing tuesday the younger daley has 
had some of both in politics and in life 
he had to fight to overcome the shadow of his father as he worked 
his way through his fathers old high school and law school 
but those difficulties paled compared to the great personal 
tragedy daley and his wife maggie endured when their 33monthold 
son kevin died in 1981 after a long battle with spina bifida 
the couples three other children nora 15 patrick 13 and 
elizabeth 5 stood alongside their 46yearold father and his wife 
on the victory platform tuesday night in a poignant moment he 
thanked each then added and especially kevin who is always in 
our hearts and to the best campaigner in the family my wife 
maggie 
daley also went through a hurtful defeat in a 1983 threeway 
primary between himself thenincumbent democratic mayor jane byrne 
and harold washington who won and went on to become the citys 
first black mayor 
ive been on both sides of these election nights he recalled 
tuesday i know what its like to win and i know what its like 
to pour your heart into a campaign and lose 
it took daley three tries to pass the bar exam to become a 
lawyer a sore point exploited during the campaign by jesse jackson 
and other opponents 
daley responded with a brusqueness many say is reminiscent of his 
father 
i flunked the bar exam so what maybe i should have committed 
suicide he said 
besides he added a passing grade only would have led to charges 
that my father had it fixed for me 
to be sure daley has been helped by his name getting elected 
to the illinois senate at age 29 and as cook county states 
attorney three times including the first win against a partyslated 
candidate 
but theres no easy way to say how strong his fathers effect has 
been said eugene kennedy a loyola university professor and author 
of a biography of the elder daley entitled himself 
theres nobody like his father but rich has acquired a 
confidence in himself and his judgment that resemble the father in 
some ways and hes overcome enough adversity on his own to 
establish a separate identity to start the long climb out from 
under his fathers shadow kennedy said 
the eldest of seven children daley had his first political post 
as an 18yearold page for the illinois delegation to the 1960 
democratic national convention 
in the state senate he showed more acumen than many gave him 
credit for and forged alliances with antimachine reformers on 
socialwelfare legislation affecting nursing homes and abolishing 
taxes on certain foods and medicine 
frank kruesi a top aide said daley studied hard as a legislator 
and knew his material 
rich has been handicapped by the fact that people have trouble 
getting past his name kruesi said 
if his name were richard j schwartz hed be lionized for the 
work hes done as a legislator and as states attorney

measles has hit some colleges this winter but 
federal health officials said outbreaks of the disease normally 
associated with childhood are scattered and no cause for great alarm 
students lined up for measles vaccine last week at the cw post 
campus of new yorks long island university and free inoculations 
were offered this week at the university of texas 
a measles outbreak caused catawba college in salisbury nc to 
cancel its basketball season and ohios kent state university 
stopped sending nursing students to local hospitals for fear of 
giving patients measles 
were definitely having measles outbreaks right now but it is 
unfortunately nothing new said dr diane simpson of the us 
centers for disease controls immunization division we do get 
outbreaks on college campuses and high school campuses each year 
most states require children to be inoculated for measles before 
entering school but some still reach college without immunity 
in some cases simpson said the vaccine doesnt take in others 
colleges may not have required proof of immunization 
at cw post where 19 cases were reported as of monday 
immunization rules are now being strictly enforced said spokeswoman 
mary ring 
measles cases at siena college in new york and the university of 
hartford in connecticut prompted the east coast athletic conference 
to ban spectators from the scheduled march 911 basketball 
tournament 
measles can be transmitted easily at colleges because of close 
living quarters said valerie cox assistant director for nursing 
services at the university of texas 
only three cases have been reported at the university of texas 
but 154 cases were reported recently in lubbock many of them in 
public schools and at texas tech university where the outbreak 
prompted immunization of 5200 students 
the cdc also reported measles at bradley university in illinois 
through last week 244 measles cases had been reported nationwide 
since jan 1 up from 204 at the same time last year according to 
cdc statistics 
but simpson said those figures may not reflect the recent college 
outbreaks or other recent outbreaks among younger children 
measles or rubeola is usually marked by a rash fever cough 
congestion and red sensitive eyes complications can occur without 
proper treatment 
in the late 1970s cdc measles specialists believed the once 
common childhood disease could be eradicated in the united states by 
fall 1982 but in the last six years 1497 to 6282 cases have been 
reported annually

of official conduct since last fall regarding alleged attempts to 
influence federal regulators on behalf of several texas savings and 
loan executives he also has been accused of accepting a fort worth 
condominium at a price below market value of ordering a member of 
his staff to work on his book and of using the books royalties to 
skirt limits on outside income 
wright has denied any wrongdoing a report was submitted to the 
house ethics panel last week by its counsel and the panel must 
decide whether it believes any of the charges were substantiated 
the times said the new allegation was brought to the committees 
attention in december or january

country who tuned to the services trial run 
television is a major means of communication in society mrs 
charlson said theres so much on television you tend to feel 
left out when you cant access it i really commend them that 
theyre trying to do it and do it right 
descriptive video services allows anyone with visual impairment 
or even sighted people stepping away from their tv set to follow 
the show with a stereo television set or vcr tuned to the separate 
audio program channel they can hear a narrator describe a programs 
scene and action during musical interludes or breaks in dialogue 
wgbh enlisted nine other public tv stations to test the service 
from january to july 1988 on the pbs american playhouse drama 
series 
a viewer tuned to the play lemon sky for example could hear 
as the credits rolled a mountain silhouette in the distance palm 
trees closer a boys bike between a high brown wooden fence in 
the foreground a white mid50s convertible gleaming in the sun 
its top down 
then later after a character spoke his lines he strolls away 
from the car toward the house pausing in the doorway 
i see it as something that can become widely popular and should 
be said john de witt who evaluates hightech aides for the blind 
at the american federation for the blind in new york 
its not a question only of people who are totally blind de 
witt said in a telephone interview there are millions of people 
who have very poor vision and cannot see small details on the 
screen people who are losing their vision at any time of life 
the establishment of the separate audio program channel about 
five years ago makes the new television service possible about 10 
percent of american homes can tap the audio channel now and laurie 
everett director of descriptive video services predicted access to 
the channel would be common by the turn of the century 
in a couple of years you wont be able to buy a television that 
isnt stereo she said 
wgbh is trying to raise 300000 to launch the service nationally 
five hours a week and needs 1 million annually to keep it going 
ms everett said

operators of two bookstores where 
firebombings may be linked to sales of the satanic verses 
pledged not to stop selling the book despite the violence which 
caused modest damage but no injuries 
bookstores throughout the country have been threatened if they 
carry the book that moslems call blasphemous the bombings at codys 
and waldenbooks in berkeley and at a weekly newspaper in new york 
city early tuesday were the first signs of violence in the united 
states 
at eight bookstores in santa barbara in southern california 
employees opening for business tuesday found crudely worded poorly 
typed notes warning that something bad would happen to 
shopowners selling the novel the notes were signed american 
moslems 
codys owner andy ross found no such threat but he said he had 
little doubt the firebombings were connected to the novel that 
prompted irans ayatollah khomeini to issue a death order for the 
moslem author salman rushdie and the books publishers 
i cant imagine any other reason why people would be lobbing 
bombs through bookstores codys or anyones said ross 
but ross reiterated an announcement issued last week that the 
store wouldnt give in to pressure 
we do not have it now but we will be selling it he said 
while surveying the damage to his shop a landmark dating from the 
1960s free speech movement that originated in berkeley 
waldenbooks manager bob gammon also had no plan to halt his order 
for the book although he might if he received threats or feared for 
public safety he said there was no evidence that the book was to 
blame for the bombings waldenbooks sold out verses the day 
after the khomeinis threat he said 
in new york an incendiary device was tossed through the window 
of the riverdale press in the bronx heavily damaging the building 
authorities said no one was inside at the time 
the firebombing may have been in retaliation for an editorial the 
paper ran last week supporting the right to read the novel said 
firefighter tom mctigue 
four hours after the molotov cocktail bombings at the berkeley 
bookshops a pipe bomb was found in codys it was destroyed by a 
police bomb squad without further damage to the bookstore said 
police lt michel de latour 
he said there were no suspects and few leads one man brett 
rideout 44 told officers he was sleeping in his van outside codys 
when he heard crashing glass and a car race off 
workers spent the day repairing damage at codys which was 
limited to broken glass a few scorched shelves and some damaged 
books ross said he planned to leave a charred end case in place for 
a while as a reminder of the incident 
in albany ny meanwhile novelist william kennedy recited the 
first three pages of the satanic verses at a reading rushdie was 
to have attended at the state university of new york other writers 
also read from the book and from the new novel john dollar 
published by rushdies american wife marianne wiggins 
this is a solidarity movement to show that writers must be 
allowed to find their admirers and their enemies without being 
threatened kennedy told the 150 people who attended the reading 
iranian clerics have put a 52 million bounty on the 41yearold 
rushdies head and he is in hiding with his wife in britain under 
police guard

hundreds of suspected nazi war criminals 
migrated to australia after world war ii and about 250 are under 
active investigation for major atrocities a governmentappointed 
nazi hunter said today 
bob greenwood head of the special investigations unit told the 
associated press he has more than 500 names on file all immigrants 
who took out citizenship when immigration formalities were virtually 
nonexistent 
greenwood previously had said his department was investigating 
almost 400 names supplied by the simon wiesenthal center in vienna 
austria 
he said he was shocked at the level of atrocities committed by 
some people who now regard themselves as australians 
most of the crimes greenwood is investigating were committed by 
eastern europeans he said refusing to go into detail 
we have in excess of 540 people and about half or 250 are 
under active investigation greenwood said we are dealing with 
people who came to australia after world war ii took out 
citizenship or became longstanding residents who had committed war 
crimes 
the government enacted legislation last year to prosecute nazi 
war criminals but exempted australian war veterans and japanese 
prime minister bob hawke appointed greenwood after a radio 
program on the governmentfunded australian broadcasting corp 
alleged that former nazis sought refuge in australia after 1945 and 
were now living comfortably 
opposition liberal party member peter baume says he has found out 
with the help of australias freedom of information act that some of 
the suspected war criminals are guilty of killing thousands of 
people 
the brisbane sun newspaper said greenwood may be forced to seek 
more time from attorneygeneral lionel bowen to complete files on 
australian citizens suspected of committing wartime atrocities 
he initially began investigating 70 names but more were provided 
by wiesenthal who spent part of the war in a nazi death camp the 
newspaper said the first of 12 major prosecutions are expected in 
june 
opponents of the war crimes act have argued that war crimes 
trials would be too timeconsuming and expensive critics also have 
argued against the reliability of soviet evidence in such exercises 
greenwood is due to report his findings within one month but he 
told the brisbane sun newspaper we still have a long way to go 
he said most suspects were from europes baltic states and had 
worked with the nazi regime to carry out crimes against jews the 
handicapped and others as part of hitlers purification program 
greenwood expressed shock at some of the atrocities 
australia accepted hundreds of thousands of people from all 
over europe so some alleged war criminals obviously have come to 
australia he said 
in hindsight there were not enough resources to adequately 
screen immigrants australia was crying out for immigrants in the 
immediate postwar years and just filling the ships to bring them to 
australia which now has double the population of 16 million 
greenwood has traveled to the united states israel canada and 
britain to pursue his investigations

californias tinseltown may be the best 
known hollywood but at least 11 others around the country dont 
want their name to be taken in vain 
representatives of the other hollywoods held a summit here 
tuesday to plot their opposition to the movie capitals attempt to 
trademark the communitys name and collect royalties for its use 
they should just back off honestly said mara giulianti 
mayor of this seaside city of 125000 just north of miami i 
dont believe a makebelieve hollywood can compete with the things 
were doing 
trademark opponents offered historical arguments civic pride 
the us constitution and a bit of showmanship a 7foot egret that 
is this citys mascot to buttress their campaign to keep their 
name in the public domain 
the west coasts hollywood chamber of commerce applied in 1986 
for a trademark with the us patent and trademark office and 
comment will be accepted until march 18 
maria chiaro city attorney for floridas hollywood said 
opponents may seek an extension to force hollywood calif to prove 
ownership of the name 
a trademark would guarantee power to regulate promotional 
educational and legislative activity under the hollywood name and 
would allow the trademark holder to charge royalties she said 
ms giulianti began uniting the other hollywoods last week and 
representatives from florida maryland alabama texas new mexico 
south carolina mississippi georgia louisiana illinois and 
arkansas gathered here they agreed to draft a resolution for a 
joint fight and may form an unofficial sister cities program 
we feel a protest loud and clear will be warranted said the 
mayor wearing a rhinestone hollywood pin in her jacket lapel 
rodney thompson a st marys county commissioner from hollywood 
md 50 miles south of washington dc said the trademark issue 
would have ramifications down the road which would be hard to 
swallow 
lets kindle the fire a little hotter because im hot said 
james ross dover of rural hollywood in northeast georgia 
hollywood vs hollywood lets see how the fight turns out right 
now its looking a little better 
his unincorporated community was founded in 1807 which he 
claimed makes it the oldest hollywood in the united states the name 
hollywood was registered with the los angeles county recorder 80 
years later after having been adopted from an estate near chicago 
that is now part of brookfield ill 
bill welsh of the hollywood calif chamber of commerce said the 
proposed trademark would merely help the chamber garner royalties 
from the sale of souvenirs to pay for upkeep of attractions like the 
1800 stars in the walk of fame and the big white hollywood sign 
we are not going to make them pay to use the name said 
welsh we have tried time and again to tell that lady hollywood 
fla mayor giulanti and other people down there and we just 
cant seem to get the point across 
but even some in los angeles expressed sympathy with the 
trademark opponents the hollywood calif citizens association has 
suggested filing a counterclaim to the application 
do not make the name hollywood synonymous with profit the 
association officers wrote it would be a disservice to all 
average citizens of hollywoods everywhere who live and raise 
families and proudly say hooray for hollywoods

in an attack unprecedented in the staterun press 
a prominent sociologist has accused the ruling communist party of 
spreading political lies that have deceived the soviet people 
for generations 
igor m klyamkins article in februarys editions of novy mir 
magazine comes as the soviets prepare for next months national 
elections the first in which voters will have more than one 
candidate to choose from 
in an obvious reference to president mikhail s gorbachevs push 
for democratization as part of his reform campaign the author 
asserts that genuine democracy will not be possible unless the 20 
millionmember party permits open dissent in its ranks 
klyamkin hints at the central paradox of gorbachevs 
democratization push that it is occurring under the aegis of a 
party that has declared itself societys sole legitimate ruler 
the author does not openly call for the creation of a multiparty 
system but that seems the inescapable conclusion many will draw 
from his criticism of antidemocratic practices he says the 
communist party has engaged in starting from the days of soviet 
founder vladimir i lenin 
the major reason for lies starting to dominate society was that 
the majority whatever it was composed of was fated to limit 
interparty democracy and violate the rights of the minority this 
was discovered even when lenin was still alive klyamkin wrote 
the political lie he said leads to catastrophe when some 
organization or group of people has a full monopoly on power and 
information where nobody can catch them deceiving others or to put 
it more simply when there is no democracy 
the article seems certain to fuel debate about the partys role 
in political institutions being created this year as part of 
gorbachevs plan to define more clearly the responsibilities of 
party and government 
later this month soviet voters are to elect a new 2550seat 
council of peoples deputies that will choose a more active supreme 
soviet parliament and the countrys president the government 
position held by gorbachev who also is party general secretary 
klyamkin said the political reforms are flawed by measures 
which even the most vivid imagination cannot call democratic 
the political changes give the party and other officially 
recognized organizations the right to directly fill one third of the 
seats in the new assembly and unlike current practice impose a 
twostep system for the election of supreme soviet deputies who 
since 1937 have been directly chosen by voters but who will now be 
elected by the council of peoples deputies 
there are no free elections yet and im not sure that there 
will be any soon wrote klyamkin who works at the institute of 
economics of the world socialist system a kremlin think tank 
he also said antidemocratic traditions in the party had not 
palpably changed in the nearly four years that gorbachev has been at 
the helm and that open debate on major issues is still muzzled by 
the quest for monolithic unity 
the article was the latest published by official media 
criticizing the role of the party in society 
in january the leningradbased magazine neva said gorbachevs 
campaign for economic and social change was being sabotaged by a 
new class of party and government bureaucrats and that the 
leadership was powerless to stop it 
despite the partys claim that it serves the people and is the 
vanguard of society the average soviet practically never had 
access to the real levers of power and doesnt have it now either 
biologist and plant director sergei y andreyev wrote in neva 
in a speech friday in the ukrainian capital of kiev gorbachev 
used traditional formulas in describing the party he leads as the 
vanguard social force but said it should be societys guide 
and not its commanding officer

about 4000 kosovo slavs and their 
children converged on belgrade today to protest alleged ethnic 
persecution by the majority albanians in the impoverished southern 
region the state tanjug news agency said 
the flagcarrying chanting serbs and montenegrins jammed steets 
and interrupted traffic as they walked from the railroad station to 
the downtown parliament 
taxi drivers brandishing pictures of the popular serbian party 
chief slobodan milosevic gave free rides to the elderly 
speaking to a rally in the capital tuesday that drew an estimated 
500000 people milosevic vowed to arrest the organizers of protests 
and strikes by ethnic albanians in kosovo an autonomous province 
of the serbian republic 
serbs who support milosevic believe the albanians in kosovo 
which was ancient serbias heartland want to unite the province 
with neighboring albania about 90 percent of kosovos people are 
ethnic albanians 
growing ethnic nationalism has created the greatest threat to 
yugoslav unity since the 1980 death of president tito whose 
leadership held the disparate nation of 23 million people together 
an economic crisis has combined with the resurgence of ethnic and 
religious rivalries to threaten the loose confederation of six 
republics and two provinces 
the republics of slovenia and croatia support demands by ethnic 
albanians for guarantees that kosovos autonomy will not be 
restricted the two are yugoslavias most liberal and economically 
advanced republics 
macedonia supports the serbs the largest ethnic group in 
yugoslavia 
kosovo was outwardly peaceful tuesday except for scattered 
serbian protests under emergency measures imposed monday after a 
week of unrest among the provinces 18 million people 
official yugoslav media said about 1000 slavs had announced 
plans to leave kosovo immediately alleging harassment by ethnic 
albanians 
meanwhile 500 ethnic albanians in the trepca leadzinc mine in 
kosovo continued their strike to protest serbian plans to change the 
constitution in a bid to win greater control over their province 
on monday 1300 ethnic albanian miners came out from pits after 
an eightday sitin that forced the resignation of three kosovo 
communist party leaders they consider proserbian 
doctors from croatia said the exhausted miners would be unable to 
work for at least a week 
tanjug said peace prevailed this morning in kosovos capital of 
pristina where additional military vehicles and soldiers had been 
sent on monday 
but in sarajevo capital of the republic of bosniaherzegovina 
2000 students lent support to milosevics drive for more control 
over kosovo and demanded the resignations of the three leaders be 
rescinded 
thousands of workers in macedonia also sided with serbia in more 
protests today and sent messages of support to belgrade students 
saying sarajevo is with you and slovenia is lying tanjug 
said 
about 1000 slovenian intellectuals held an antiserbian protest 
tuesday in slovenias capital ljubljana and about 100000 
slovenians have signed a petition against the emergency measures in

a 91yearold man described by federal law 
enforcement officials as a financial top man among bookies has 
been freed despite his refusal to cooperate in a criminal 
investigation 
us district judge william g young ordered harry doc 
sagansky released from the plymouth county house of correction on 
tuesday reversing an earlier decision he did not comment on the 
decision 
it feels good to be out sagansky said as he left with his 
son im just going to go home and have some dinner 
his lawyer morris m goldings described sagansky as suffering 
from depression last week in asking the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals to review the case goldings said the appeals court 
suggested that young review the case 
in court papers sagansky said he feared bodily harm to 
himself and his family if he answered a grand jurys questions about 
a case involving the new england organized crime task force 
at one point sagansky said he would rather die in jail than 
share his knowledge with law enforcement officials 
the fbi in june 1987 said that sagansky and two men reputed to be 
potential leaders in the boston mob were targets of a racketeering 
investigation but goldings said his client was being sought as a 
witness and was not a target of investigators 
sagansky invoked the fifth amendment before a federal grand jury 
on july 1 1987 and declined to answer questions he was later 
granted immunity from prosecution but still refused to answer 
questions 
he was ordered jailed by young on feb 3 1988 after discussions 
with federal prosecutors concerning the federal witness protection 
plan fell through

interests

the number of poor families with children is 
growing rapidly increasing the number of youngsters without proper 
health care the national association of childrens hospitals and 
related institutions said today 
in a report the group predicted that by the end of the century 
onethird of all american children will live below the poverty line 
and that youngsters from such families are at the highest risk for 
poor health 
the no 1 key to the poor status of our nations children 
relative to their health is insurance and we see that 12 
million of them one in every five do not have insurance either 
public or private william considine chairman of the association 
said on nbcs today show 
he said the studys authors found that 7 million children do not 
receive routine medical care from the ages of 1 to 4 the parents 
delay care he said because they cannot access the care because 
of the inability of insurance 
thus considine added those children do not come to our 
childrens hospitals throughout the country until their course of 
illness is welldeveloped and its at a state where its more 
costly and the consequences already more developed and set in 
the report also noted 
nearly 40000 of the 38 million children born in 1987 in the 
united states died before their first birthday 
since 1979 nearly a quarter of all pregnant women received 
little or no prenatal care 
low birthweight infants in the us have remained at 68 
percent of the infants born in contrast to 4 percent in western 
europe

route today from the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant to a 
temporary storage site in idaho relieving a waste buildup that 
threatened to close the plant 
idaho gov cecil andrus who in october closed his state to 
shipments of radioactive waste lifted his ban on thursday he said

andrus cited national security interests rocky flats operated 
for the department of energy by rockwell international produces 
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
the plant 17 miles from denver could have been shut down as early 
as this month gov roy romer in october threatened to close it when 
it reached its waste storage capacity 
the boxcars which rocky flats spokesman ed heintz said left 
tuesday for a trip that takes seven to nine days contained 150 
cubic yards of clothing and equipment contaminated with small 
amounts of plutonium 
were real pleased to get it out heintz said this gives 
us another six months breathing room to work on a permanent 
solution with doe and congress 
before tuesday 1332 cubic yards of waste had piled up at the 
plant which is under a stateimposed limit of 1601 cubic yards of 
storage 
one hundredfifty cubic yards is about a months worth of waste 
generated under current plant production levels when rocky flats is 
operating at full capacity it generates 200 to 250 cubic yards of 
waste each month 
last week romer said he would allow rocky flats to continue 
operations until late this year depending on how much waste is 
generated there 
romer and andrus are pushing department of energy officials to 
meet a target date of sept 1 for the opening of the waste isolation

aircraft manufacturers will be hardpressed to 
meet the anticipated demand for new planes to replace aging 
jetliners industry analysts say 
the boeing co mcdonnell douglas and airbus industrie already 
have interesting challenges ahead in meeting the delivery 
commitments already made said wolfgang h demisch of union bank 
of switzerland in an interview from new york 
some models ordered today wont be delivered until 1996 he said 
at this point pouring more orders into the funnel isnt going 
to make more airplanes come out at the bottom said demisch the 
greater risk is that in this rush suppliers will be overstretched 
and cant deliver as quickly as expected already there are 
components in tight supply and thats not going to get much 
easier 
with the joint governmentindustry aging aircraft task force 
recommending that the federal aviation administration order 800 
million in maintenance analysts predicted the pressure to replace 
older planes will increase 
paul h nisbet of prudentialbache said airlines saw the need to 
replace planes several years ago as maintenance costs began rising 
i think a lot of orders seen in the last two or three years 
have been for replacement nisbet said before that orders were 
just for traffic growth 
nisbet said he expected 600 to 700 new plane orders annually over 
the next few years including as many as 200 to 300 to replace older 
planes 
boeings stock has held firm in the 60 range during the latest 
incident involving a plane it built a united airlines 747 in which 
the fuselage tore open after takeoff from honolulu to new zealand on 
friday 
nine passengers were sucked to their deaths from the plane 
investigators have focused on a cargo door as a likely cause of the 
incident 
george shapiro of salomon brothers in new york said consumers 
havent blamed carriers or boeing for the accident the recent crash 
of a british midland airways 737 that killed 44 or the aloha 
airlines 737 that ripped open in april sending a flight attendant 
to her death 
theres no question boeing is going through a string of 
unfortunate troubles from crashes holes developing in its planes 
in flight and with quality problems on new aircraft he said 
but boeing has more planes out there than any other manufacturer 
and they are getting older 
boeing officials have denied any connection between the recent 
spate of incidents

estimated 10000 guerrillas in colombias five guerrilla armies but 
it collapsed under the weight of accusations by rebels and security

mayor coleman young vetoed an ordinance offering 
shelter in municipal buildings to thousands of homeless people 
calling it unnecessary costly and potentially damaging to detroits 
convention business 
tuesdays veto came a day after the city council voted 80 to use 
municipal buildings to provide shelter heat restrooms and security 
for homeless people for 60 days 
the ordinance would have opened up recreation department 
buildings the vacant detroit general hospital ford auditorium and 
a civic center meeting place where an estimated 40000 people are 
attending a convention of automotive engineers 
to begin with more effective and responsible plans for the 
homeless already have been and are being implemented young said 
in a statement in addition this ordinance is so broad and 
farreaching as to be unworkable 
it would cost over 2 million to operate it would seriously 
curtail vital neighborhood programs run by the recreation department 
and police athletic league and it would seriously damage our 
ability to bring meetings and conventions and the thousands of jobs 
they create to the civic center he said 
young said existing shelters had beds available every night and 
that the citys homeless intervention program has placed 400 
homeless families in permanent housing but advocates for the 
homeless disputed that claim 
we dont have any records of him placing anybody and 
especially not 400 people said theresa smith spokeswoman for 
the detroitwayne county union of the homeless hes not done half 
of what he says hes done 
councilman clyde cleveland said tuesday he expects the council to 
attempt to override youngs veto 
cleveland said he had not reviewed youngs veto message and could 
not comment on it he also would not predict whether an override 
would succeed 
estimates of the number of homeless people in the nations 
sixthlargest city range from 12000 to 60000 out of a population 
of 11 million

the official iraqi news agency today 
denounced a report by amnesty international that said the children 
of political prisoners have been tortured abused and imprisoned in 
iraq 
ina quoted an unidentified editor as calling the report by the 
international human rights organization cheap allegations in an 
antiiraqi propaganda campaign 
the editor pointed to the planned political reforms announced by 
president saddam hussein to dispute the charges 
these lies aired by enemy circles come at a time when iraq 
announces its serious efforts through continuous meetings of the 
political leadership to set the permanent constitution of the 
country and to permit political parties and press freedom 
said the report which was monitored in nicosia 
hussein has said political parties will be permitted and has 
encouraged the press to be more critical 
the new laws have not been announced but former opposition 
parties such as the islamic call and the communists will not be 
permitted on the ground they had dealings with iran iraqs foe in 
the eightyear persian gulf war 
the editor said iraqi children get free education health care 
and social security 
amnesty international issued a report on tuesday saying that 
children and young people have become the innocent victims of a 
policy of political repression in iraq 
it said opponents of husseins government have sometimes had to 
pay for their activities with the welfare and sometimes the 
lives of their children between 1983 and 1988 
children as young as five months old have been imprisoned and 
hundreds have disappeared the report said

the rightwing likud bloc upset the labor party 
in nationwide municipal elections and prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said today the voting indicates israelis support likuds antiplo 
policies 
shimon peres the labor party leader and finance minister 
insisted tuesdays balloting had nothing to do with the palestinian 
issue and said he was willing to hold a separate referendum on the 
subject 
other labor leaders demanded a shakeup to halt a decline in their 
partys standing since november when likud won the premiership in 
national elections 
political analysts said the results showed labors historic 
dominance of the grassroots level had eroded 
in a key race of tuesdays election jerusalem mayor teddy kollek 
was reelected for a sixth term but he lost control of the city 
council as religious parties increased their representation to 
nearly half the city council 
the biggest gains were made by such ultraorthodox parties as 
shas agudat israel and degel hatorah their success will probably 
give them more power than the traditional more moderate orthodox 
parties 
the religious gains also could fuel tensions between secular and 
observant jews in the city because kollek will need to enlist the 
support of the ultraorthodox to govern israeli news reports said 
but the 77yearold kollek who has been in office since 1965 
said he still expected to control the city i will give other 
people an ulcer instead of getting one myself he said 
shlomo lahat likud mayor of tel aviv also won reelection 
the results in haifa where labor mayor aryeh gurel was in a 
tight race with his likud rival were uncertain after a dispute 
developed today over the counting of ballots israel radio reported 
likud appeared to have won several labor strongholds including 
the southern port of ashdod and the town of beersheba in the negev 
desert 
israel and army radio said likud also won several communities 
around tel aviv that labor had held including holon petach tikvah 
and ramat gan 
ultraorthodox religious parties scored gains throughout the 
country repeating their success of the november general elections 
according to unofficial results based on 43 percent of the vote 
at stake were 147 local councils and mayoralities in the last 
national municipal elections in 1983 labor won in 54 towns 
compared to 26 taken by likud the remainder went to local slates or 
religious parties 
shamir who had billed the elections as a referendum on israels 
refusal to negotiate peace with the plo said on israel radio the 
results will signal to various people in the world so they know 
who is dominant in the israeli political system who is the one who 
determines who has the stronger voice 
there is no doubt that the elections show likud is getting 
stronger and at the same time the majority supports its 
political positions 
peres acknowledged in a radio interview that labor has 
definitely been dealt a blow and i dont want to underestimate its 
force 
but he disputed claims the results showed wide public support for 
likuds views on the arabisraeli conflict 
officially both labor and likud oppose palestine liberation 
organization participation in peace talks based on a claim that it 
is a terrorist organization but there are growing calls inside 
labor to reconsider this policy now that plo chairman yasser arafat 
has said he renounces terrorism and recognizes israels right to 
exist 
labor leaders including peres aides have met recently with 
prominent palestinians in the occupied territories who are known to 
be plo supporters 
energy minister moshe shahal of labor said his partys losses 
were a further sign of the decline of the party that has failed to 
win any of the last four general elections on the national level 
labor and likud have been governing in an uneasy coalition since 
1984 with neither party able to score an outright victory in 
general elections 
about 48 percent of israels 27 million voters went to the polls 
on tuesday down from 55 percent in 1983 voters cast two ballots 
one for mayor and the second for a party slate for city council 
in jerusalem kollek won 64 percent while his slate received 12 
of 31 council seats down from 17 religious parties meanwhile 
increased their seats from 10 to 15 
kollek lost his majority in part because of the boycott of east 
jerusalems 80000 arab voters traditionally kollek backers fewer 
than 2 percent went to the polls compared to 18 percent in 1983 
the boycott was ordered by the ploallied leadership of the 
15month palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip the leaders called a general strike 
tuesday to enforce the order and urged palestinians to punish those 
who ignored the boycott 
in the arab sector islamic fundamentalists ousted the communist 
leadership of the secondlargest city umm el fahem causing concern 
that antiisraeli sentiment is spreading among israeli arabs

for decades venezuelans dreamed that 
oil would cure the economic woes of their petroleumrich country 
that illusion held even after oil prices began to plummet 
appears to have ended with the worst violence in venezuela in 31 
years 
increases of 30 percent to 50 percent in public transport tariffs 
and price gouging by bus drivers acted as a detonator for an economy 
in rapid deterioration 
the slide in the price of oil which accounts for 90 percent of 
venezuelan export revenue coupled with a suffocating 33 billion 
foreign debt 
the nation pocketed an estimated 9 billion in oil revenues last 
year compared to 19 billion in 1981 
inflation this year is expected to reach 70 percent up from 35 
percent last year 
president carlos andres perez who took power three weeks ago 
announced a sweeping economic reform package intended to breathe 
life into the stagnant economy and persuade international bankers to 
increase loans to the country 
some of those reforms included freeing interest rates doubling 
gasoline prices and establishing a freefloating currency with a 
consequent increase in the price of imports 
the violence that erupted across the nation monday showed the 
difficulty the government will have implementing the economic 
reforms 
the reforms were backed by the international monetary fund from 
which perez hopes to obtain a 15 billion shortterm loan 
until now venezuela had avoided turning to the imf for a 
bailout perez himself called the organization the equivalent of 
economic totalitarianism venezuela has 18 million inhabitants 
and was for years an island of tranquility in a sea of regional 
violence political instability and economic recession 
under perezs first administration from 1973 to 1978 oil prices 
boomed and the country enjoyed an unparalleled prosperity there was 
full employment and inflation did not break single digits 
those memories were enough to guarantee perez a landslide victory 
in the election dec4 say political experts 
perez evoked for venezuelans a bonanza and now theyve had a 
rude awakening said sociologist and university professor anibal 
romero 
romero said he did not believe the disturbances threatened 
venezuelas democracy saying the country had lived through worst 
crises including guerrilla movements in the 1960s 
jose vicente rangel former leftist presidential candidate and 
congressman said the riots represented the beginnings of an end 
of an era of a style of life 
its the breaking of the illusion that all politicians had that 
this could never happen here it did happen indeed and its proof 
of the impoverishment of the country were not used to inflation

the elephants of point defiance zoo are 
getting bigger homes at a 15 million cost improvements 
necessitated largely by a profoundly problematic pachyderm named 
cindy the zoo director says 
cindy a 24yearold from asia is returning after six years on 
loan to the san diego wild animal park in fact the san diego zoo 
is pleading with tacoma officials to hasten cindys return said zoo 
director tom otten 
it isnt so much that the fourton cindy wouldnt mate with any 
of the bull elephants in san diego but three weeks ago she broke a 
handlers collarbone with a slap of her trunk 
from time to time cindy has made aggressive motions toward 
keepers she doesnt like and thats most of our keepers said 
joel edelstein of the san diego zoo we wouldnt fight the 
decision to let her go 
the return has added urgency to the need to build bigger elephant 
barns using money from a prior bond issue 
otherwise otten said well have to go out of the elephant 
business 
moyo and thandi the zoos 8yearold female african elephants 
also could use larger quarters otten said 
part of the plan is for construction this summer of a special 
yard for cindy with an elephant crush a hydraulic steel device 
to contain the animal while trainers trim toenails and tusks 
administer medication and take blood and fluid samples 
the san diego zoo does not have such a device so trainers must 
rely on each other to keep elephants still

trains loaded with snow have been rattling 
into this usually frozen capital in a costly battle to create the 
winter that wasnt and save an annual tradition 
a record warm winter threatened to melt away the holmenkollen ski 
festival which begins thursday so organizers hauled in 5600 tons 
of snow by rail at about 15 cents a pound to rescue the event 
snow costs about the same per pound as wholesale sugar said 
knut almquist secretary general of the association for promotion of 
skiing which has organized the annual festival since 1892 
oslo and southern norway experienced the mildest january ever 
recorded state meteorologist oernulf fremming said january was a 
balmy 28 degrees above normal and oslos februarys average of 367 
degrees was nearly 12 degrees warmer than the months normal average 
temperature of 248 degrees 
the nice weather has left the holmenkollen ski jump and 
crosscountry trail near oslo without snow as its annual highpoint 
approached four days of world cup competitions that begin thursday 
two of the weeks major events a world cup 90meter ski jump and 
the annual monolith crosscountry ski race in oslos frogner 
park have already been canceled 
the state railroad nsb was hired to scoop up mountain snow from 
the center of the country and ship it 186 miles by flatcar to 
holmenkollen 
railroaders joked that snow might be a important new cash crop 
a giant boeing chinook twinrotor helicopter had been slated to 
carry flakes aloft and create its own blizzard above holmenkollen 
but was grounded by fog almquist said 
a lack of snow has not stopped holmenkollen ski jumpers since 
1925 and the association will do almost anything to save the event 
he said 
it would cost more to cancel than to ship snow our insurance 
pays for covering the ski area in snow but not for cancelling or 
moving the event he said of the more than 150000 snow purchase 
well take care of the snow if only nature will arrange the 
cold weather he said 
high temperatures and a steady drizzle had threatened to wash 
away transplanted snow but more recent colder weather and snow 
flurries have raised hopes he said 
tuesdays high in oslo was 41 degrees the low 36 
the warm spell has left norways ski manufacturers southern 
resorts and even the ski association strapped for cash but brought 
the railroad a windfall 
we wouldnt mind seeing more ski races like this its great 
for business joked per kristian flaten of nsb we really do 
hope the jumps and races go as planned after everyones efforts 
nsbs olav hollerud who engineered the snow lift said 13 trains 
have hauled 300 flatcars each carrying 187 tons of snow from the 
mountains

about 40 people driven from their homes by a 
freight train wreck were allowed back early today ending the second 
evacuation in two days 
investigators said speed rough track and a faulty car may have 
been factors in the 21car derailment sunday in which two tankers 
containing 25000 gallons of highly flammable butane caught fire and 
forced the evacuation of 2000 people 
hours after residents were allowed back in their homes tuesday a 
tanker jumped the tracks again as it was being moved causing no 
fire but prompting another evacuation that ended after the car was 
moved to a rail yard 
seven tankers are to be loaded onto flatbed cars later this week 
its wonderful to be back said jennifer graner who returned 
to work today at a business near the second derailment site 
national transportation safety board investigators said the city 
of 230000 narrowly averted disaster in the csx transportation corp 
derailment and explosion next to a bf goodrich co chemical plant 
chemicals stored outside the plant in large tanks and piped into 
the building include highly flammable butadiene and styrene as well 
as acrylonitrile which can produce toxic fumes said ntsb member 
jim burnett jr 
thats one of the reasons for the high level of safety board 
response to this situation because the potential for a catastrophic 
accident did exist here he said 
the safety board found some rough track conditions and 
alignment difficulties on the tracks which are owned and 
maintained by conrail and were last inspected by the railroad on 
feb 23 burnett said 
the tracks next to the goodrich plant had a speed limit of 40 
mph while tapes from the train place its speed at 43 or 44 mph 
burnett said he said the train crew reported it was going 39 mph 
when the accident occurred 
csx spokesman lloyd lewis asked if the train may have been going 
at an unsafe speed said if the speed limit is 40 miles per hour 
which it was and the speed tape says 43 or 44 you can conclude 
that its like a highway 
burnett said the engineer conductor and two brakemen were tested 
for alcohol or drug use the tests were sent to a lab for analysis 
he said investigators are also studying whether a hopper car that 
carried sand may have played a role it had 2 inches of excess 
lateral movement which burnett said is more than good maintenance 
practice would deem ideal 
he added we understand that this car was subject to some major 
maintenance in october of last year and this was only the second 
trip made with that car since then

secretaries sought temporary office space in the south orange county 
municipal courthouse a situation that created some problems with 
attorneyclient privacy 
the county is paying 4000 a day to hire outside attorneys to 
handle misdemeanor cases because the public defenders have no place 
private to speak with clients 
municipal court judge pamela iles said she doesnt blame the 
public defenders 
when we were pulling a dead rat a week out of the public 
defenders office it got to be too much ms iles said 
county officials agreed the trailer is uninhabitable and said 
theyre working to find new office space as soon as possible

a new law passed by the district of columbia 
council in an effort to fight the citys soaring crime rate would 
impose a curfew of 11 pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends for 
people under 18 years of age 
the temporary measure passed tuesday would allow police to detain 
violators at police stations until a parent or guardian signs for 
their release those not picked up would be held until 6 am the 
next day 
the measure introduced as emergency legislation by council 
member frank smith calls for fining parents and guardians of repeat 
offenders 100 to 500 
mayor marion s barry jr has 10 days to sign the bill which 
would put it into effect immediately or veto the measure he has 
taken no public position on it 
city corporation counsel frederick d cooke jr said his office 
would study the legislation thoroughly before advising the mayor 
whether or not to sign it 
if approved the curfew would expire after 90 days unless 
permanent legislation is enacted 
it would exempt young people engaged in specific business or 
activity related to legitimate employment after the curfew 
hours but they would have to obtain an affadavit signed by a parent 
or guardian and an employer 
some police officers said the curfew would be difficult to 
enforce and would add to patrol officers overburdened workload

different consumption habits and behavior habits said heydra

death toll had surpassed 100 in violence touched off by protests 
over price increases imposed to meet the demands of international

threats to make us not want to run useless risks the singers 
spokesman jeanpierre domboy said today 
none of the callers to the theater identified themselves domboy 
said 
i received frightful threats ms sanson said in a radio 
interview following her opening performance tuesday night at olympia

and threatened to kill her and the musicians 
authorities had no comment about the reported threats 
the incident comes amid controversy over the novel the satanic

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir in an 
interview published today called the us dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization useless and said chairman 
yasser arafat and adolf hitler belong to the same family of 
demagogues and totalitarians 
if arafat flew to israel as the late egyptian president anwar 
sadat did on a 1977 peace mission wed put him in prison 
shamir told the washington times 
interviewed in jerusalem by arnaud de borchgrave the times 
editorinchief the israeli leader called king hussein of jordan 
with whom he has offered to negotiate terms for an arabisraeli 
settlement an element of stability in the middle east 
but shamir said if a palestinian state is to be established it 
should be located on the east bank of the jordan river where 
husseins kingdom stands 
if the jordanian population one day decides to have a 
palestinian state there its up to them he said 
although jordan does not provide precise population figures it is 
believed to be at least 70 percent palestinian 
the west bank meanwhile which jordan ruled from 1947 until the 
territory was captured by israel in the 1967 mideast war has nearly 
1 million palestinians and about 60000 jews 
shamir took a tough stand on these issues as the bush 
administration ponders its policy toward the middle east israeli 
foreign minister moshe arens who is also a hardliner is due here 
for talks in two weeks with secretary of state james a baker iii 
ending a 13year ban the united states opened a dialogue with 
the plo last december over israels objections there have been 
five meetings so far in tunisia where the plo maintains its 
headquarters 
asked by the times editor if the dialogue is a bad idea shamir 
said i think its useless not healthy because it gives the plo 
more prestige and importance and in such a way that it discourages 
moderate elements who would like to find a path to real peace with 
israel 
shamir said there were many moderate elements among the 
palestinians but when they see the americans talking to the plo 
they cannot muster the courage to do anything else he said 
the us talks with the plo were based on a judgment by the 
reagan administration that arafat had renounced terrorism accepted 
israels right to exist and subscribed to un security council 
resolutions upholding the right of all states in the area to live 
within secure borders 
but shamir did not detect any change in arafats attitude 
history is replete with such phenomena who after a while 
disappear when they have outlived their usefulness he said 
take hitler there was a time in the 1930s when hitler was 
celebrated the world over as some kind of savior the end we know 
but the price was a very heavy one 
asked if he were drawing a parallel between hitler and arafat 
the israeli leader replied they belong to the same family of 
demagogues and totalitarians enemies of the jewish people men who 
think nothing of killing millions to achieve their objectives

americans personal income shot up 18 percent 
in january the biggest increase in more than a year while the pace 
of consumer spending was nearly flat after a strong gain in 
december the government reported today 
the commerce department said income rose 74 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 428 trillion in january 
following a 09 percent increase in december and a 02 percent drop 
in november 
januarys income gain was the biggest monthly increase since a 2 
percent jump in october 1987 
personal consumption spending meanwhile edged up just 01 
percent in january to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 335 
trillion following a 08 percent gain in december and a 04 percent 
jump during november the figures include virtually all consumer 
spending except interest payments on debt 
januarys 01 percent increase was the weakest performance for 
consumer spending since a 15 percent decrease last september 
a slowdown in consumer spending would be welcome news because of 
worries that demand has been outstripping the production 
capabilities of factories coping with high operating rates and tight 
labor markets 
the increase in income was paced by a 12 percent gain in the key 
component of wages and salaries reflecting continued strong 
employment 
the recent income gains were bolstered by several special 
factors including a 41 percent pay raise in january for federal 
civilian and military personnel a 4 percent costofliving increase 
in social security benefits in january and a december increase in 
farm subsidy payments the commerce department said 
but even excluding such special factors personal income still 
increased 16 percent in january and 08 percent in december 
americans disposable or aftertax incomes rose 17 percent in 
january after rising 09 percent in december and falling 03 
percent in november 
with the income gain strongly outpacing the rise in spending the 
personal savings rate savings as a percentage of disposable income 
rose to 58 percent from 43 percent in december 
spending was held back by a 3 percent decrease in spending on 
durable goods big ticket items expected to last at least three 
years purchases of services which includes housing costs were up 
05 percent purchases of nondurable goods rose 09 percent

construction spending rose 04 percent in 
january led by a strong increase in work on nonresidential 
projects such as factories offices and motels the government said 
today 
building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
424 billion in january following a 21 percent increase in 
december and a 13 percent jump in november 
januarys 04 percent increase was the weakest performance since 
a 03 percent rise last october rising interest rates have dampened 
activity in most sectors with fixedrate mortgages averaging 1078 
percent last week compared with 987 percent a year earlier 
in january residential construction rose 11 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 2046 billion reflecting an unchanged pace of 
building activity on singlefamily homes and a 37 percent gain in 
apartment construction 
apartment construction generally has been sluggish in recent 
months held back by high vacancy rates and reduced tax incentives 
for investment in such projects the category had declined 09 
percent in december 
nonresidential construction meanwhile rose 43 percent in 
january to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 991 billion hotel 
and motel building was up 87 percent and factory construction rose 
73 percent 
activity in the industrial sector has been bolstered over the 
past year as manufacturers expanded capacity to meet rising demand 
generated by strong export sales although the pace of exports 
slowed during the last quarter of 1988 
construction of office buildings was up 22 percent during 
january while work on religious facilities rose 111 percent and 
other commercial projects increased 5 percent 
government construction meanwhile declined 49 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 817 billion the largest category for 
government construction highways and streets was down 10 percent

the government has commuted the 
death sentences of 16 prisoners including an activist who was the 
subject of clemency appeals from the united nations the justice 
ministry said today 
the reprieves were hailed by human rights organizations as an 
indication the government might be heeding widespread criticism of 
the frequent use of capital punishment there were 164 hangings in 
south africa in 1987 and 117 in 1988 
the justice ministry gave no explanation for the action merely 
listing the 16 prisoners granted clemency in each case the death 
sentence was commuted to a prison term ranging from 10 years to 
life 
a ministry spokeswoman marie pienaar said the affected 
prisoners included one mixedrace man and 15 blacks among them paul 
setlaba who was convicted of committing murder during a 1985 black 
consumer boycott 
the ministry said the sentences were commuted by the state 
president but it was not immediately clear if that referred to 
president pw botha who is recovering from a stroke or his 
replacement acting president chris heunis setlabas execution was 
stayed by justice minister kobie coetsee in november hours before 
he was to be hanged 
the stay followed appeals for clemency by human rights groups in 
south africa and by the un security council which depicted 
setlaba as an antiapartheid activist caught up in political unrest 
details of the other reprieved prisoners cases were not 
disclosed 
brian currin director of south africas lawyers for human rights 
organization commended the government for granting the reprieves 
he also said he was heartened that only two people had been executed 
so far this year compared to a monthly average of more than 10 in 
recent years 
these statistics together with the 16 clemencies give us hope 
that the state is beginning to appreciate the need to review those 
laws in south africa that have resulted in the execution of so many 
people he said 
currin noted that setlabas lastminute stay was issued by 
coetsee after a supreme court judge had rejected an application for 
a stay the judge had asserted that there was no prospect of 
clemency for setlaba 
the black sash civil rights group also commended the reprieves 
but reiterated its call for a moratorium on all hangings while 
experts consider the possible abolition of the death penalty

a federal appeals court has ordered the 
nuclear regulatory commission to reopen licensing hearings for a 
nuclear power plant 25 miles from philadelphia because the nrc 
disregarded safety modifications 
an opponent of the limerick plant hailed tuesdays ruling by the 
3rd us court of appeals 
the court said the nrcs failure to consider safety design 
alternatives could have affected the decision in 1985 to grant a 
fullpower operating license to philadelphia electric co 
spokesmen for peco and the nrc declined to comment on the effect 
of the ruling 
but charles w elliott an attorney for plant opponent limerick 
ecology action said the ruling forces the nrc to reopen the 
licensing procedure 
it certainly sets a precedent it says that the nrc can no 
longer violate the national environmental policy act by refusing to 
consider safer reactor designs there is now no excuse for peco not 
to implement design changes to reduce accident risk elliott said 
the limerick plant which went on line at full power in 1985 is 
one of three operating in the country within 50 miles of a major 
metropolitan area 
limerick ecology action had challenged the plants licensing in a 
lawsuit in 1987 the challenge to the limerick license was supported 
by the state and the national union of concerned scientists in 
friendofthecourt briefs 
we feel its a big victory said limerick ecology action 
president david g stone not only will it help us it helps other 
cases around the country

they killed 67 soldiers and wounded 25 in the attack on the military 
detachment in santa rosa de lima 110 miles east of san salvador

appeared to be greatly exaggerated 
a military source commenting on condition of anonymity said

many

on the garrison

cristiani presidential candidate of arena the report could not be 
immediately confirmed 
cristiani is favored to win the presidential election scheduled

elections 
the military had said it would halt attacks at midnight and had 
urged the guerrillas who are trying to negotiate participation in 
national elections to also cease hostilities 
the military announced the threemonth halt in offensive 
operations after the rebels offered to declare a unilateral 
ceasefire of their own to help facilitate direct peace talks with 
president jose napoleon duarte

and venue for the talks that duarte called for on sunday 
the armed forces said in a statement that the ceasefire took 
hold at midnight tuesday and would last until june 1 duartes last 
day in office 
it did not say whether the military would abide by the truce if 
the guerrillas kept up their attacks 
on jan 24 the rebels offered to take part in and respect the 
results of the presidential vote if it was postponed several months 
they have boycotted the decades five previous national elections 
duarte had called for a threemonth ceasefire and for talks on 
ending the civil war to begin tuesday in guatemala he also said he 
favored holding the presidential vote on april 30 
the rebels rejected the site saying talks should be saturday and 
sunday in san salvador they also balked at an unilateral 
ceasefire insisting a lasting truce should be part of the 
negotiations 
an estimated 70000 people have been killed and 500000 to 1 
million people displaced during the civil war

prime minister rajiv gandhis government 
has slashed defense spending and diverted funds to fight hunger 
illiteracy and provide homes for the homeless 
the unprecedented reduction in defense spending was contained in 
the governments budget for 198990 introduced in parliament on 
tuesday by finance minister shankarrao b chavan 
gandhis government reacted to criticism that it is oriented 
toward the rich by pledging to reduce official expenditures and 
slapping new levies on cars televisions electronic goods air 
travel and hotel tariffs 
analysts said the budget was aimed at wooing the electorate most 
of them the rural poor 
gandhi came to power in 1984 after the assassination of his 
mother and predecessor indira gandhi under indian law he is 
required to call national elections by the end of the year 
india will spend 2 billion rupees 133 million less on defense 
in the 198990 fiscal year compared to the previous years expenses 
chavan said 
indias armed forces with the sixth largest army in the world 
has 13 million soldiers 
the budget proposal calls for total spending of 8216 billion 
rupees 547 billion in the 198990 fiscal year which runs from 
april 1 through march 31 in 198889 the total budget was 7356 
billion rupees 566 billion 
in february 1988 the exchange rate was an estimated 12 rupees to 
1 the current rate is 15 rupees to 1 
chavan pledged to spend 17 billion rupees 11 billion on 
programs to fight hunger illiteracy and provide housing for the 
homeless the amount is up by 5 billion rupees 333 million from 
last year 
the increased funds for such programs will be raised directly 
from taxing the uppermiddle classes including an 8 percent 
surcharge on annual incomes of more than 50000 rupees or 3333 
government estimates for march 1988 indicate that 165 million 
families defined as a unit of five people need housing in india 
meaning that 825 million people are considered homeless 
chavan said the nation was proud of the armed forces for bringing 
credit to our country when called upon to help other countries in 
their hour of need but he added all of us recognize that there 
is continuing need for implementing measures for greater cost 
effectiveness 
india is spending 24 million rupees 16 million a day to 
maintain 40000 troops in neighboring sri lanka they have been 
stationed there since 1987 to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending 
the 5yearold tamil separatist war 
besides maintaining its armed forces on the frontiers with china 
and pakistan india is spending a huge amount to keep its control 
over a himalayan glacial ridge on the borders with pakistan 
the 50milelong siachen glacier the longest in the himalayas 
is strategic because it overlooks china and indian military 
concentrations in the valleys nearby there have been a series of 
confrontations on the glacier since 1983 but the skirmishes 
escalated into a major clash in september 1987 followed by several 
more clashes

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the nation 
feb 28 
democrat and chronicle and timesunion rochester ny on john 
tower 
if as some of his critics say john tower really is a 
problem drinker then he cant be counted on to keep that 
promise not to take an alcoholic drink if confirmed as defense 
secretary however much he means to do so now 
true some people who drink too much just up and quit but many 
others need treatment and the senate cant assume that a guy with a 
drinking problem will stop just because he says he will 
its too late for tower to take back his promise but the senate 
shouldnt be moved by it 
what matters is the evidence if it shows that towers drinking 
or his recent work for prominent defense contractors would intefere 
with his duties he should not be confirmed

the albuquerque nm tribune on the supreme court private 
violence ruling 
the us supreme court held the other day that states are not 
obliged by the constitution to protect children from abuse by their 
parents while that may be a technically correct ruling many 
citizens undoubtedly will feel that the decision somehow falls short 
the case before the court involved a 4yearold wisconsin boy 
whose father beat the child so severely that he suffered brain 
damage that left him retarded and facing the rest of his life in an 
institution 
whats disturbing aside from the fathers inhumanity is the 
fact that state authorities knew that the child joshua deshaney 
had been abused repeatedly before the final attack that put the boy 
in a coma 
the boys mother divorced from the father and living in another 
state sued wisconsin on grounds of violating joshuas 
constitutional rights to life and liberty by not coming to his aid 
when authorities knew he was being abused 
while legally in the clear wisconsin authorities can hardly

los angeles times on the bush budget breakdown 
president bush sent his budget changes to congress two weeks ago 
with the flourishes appropriate to a kinder gentler nation but it 
soon became apparent that his famed flexible freeze is more of the 
same old formula of cutting domestic spending 
the congressional budget office is correct however when it 
considers the baseline budget the amount of money allowing for 
inflation that a program would have to get in the succeeding year 
to provide the same service as in the previous year for as many 
people as are eligible for the service 
bush has claimed that he has frozen defense spending and many 
domestic programs in like fashion 
but defense is getting an inflation adjustment of 102 billion 
while the domestic programs are being held to the same dollar 
amounts as in the current budget year thus his flexible freeze 
really is a 96 billion cut from the baseline budget

b gibbs is calling it quits 
but its not he insists because hes frustrated with his job 
in fact gibbs says the irs is getting better at processing tax 
forms and providing customer service 
but its clear from his comments that theres still room for 
improvement 
probably few federal bureaucrats have a more difficult job than 
the person in charge of the irs it certainly appears that gibbs

san antonio expressnews on singleparent children 
bad news from the census bureau the number of singleparent 
households is up sharply since 1980 continuing a trend that goes 
back three decades more than 15 million us children now live 
apart from their mother or father 
in 1960 only 7 percent of white children and 22 percent of black 
were so labeled in 1988 the figures were 19 percent and 54 
percent respectively thus an absolute majority of black children 
are now being raised by a single parent 
no government program can substitute for the economic and moral 
benefits of growing up in a family with loving authoritative role 
models of both sexes 
until our culture finds a way to reverse the collapse of such 
families welfare dependency will continue to perpetuate itself

statesmanjournal salem ore on a usmexico border ditch 
the proposal to dig a ditch on the usmexican border near san 
diego has swollen into an issue out of all proportion to its size or 
importance 
it should quickly be acknowledged for what it is an 
illconceived and poorly managed project 
the us immigration and naturalization service has so badly 
bungled publicity that the original purpose of the fourmilelong 
ditch is uncertain 
some say it is to improve drainage on a flat bit of mesa 
others say the 8footdeep 14footwide ditch is intended to block 
what is said to be the most popular route used by drug smugglers and 
illegal aliens to drive across the border 
there is a problem of drug trafficking and illegal entry across 
our southern border 
it is time for the us to acknowledge that the longterm 
solution to the border conflict lies not in more conflict but in 
understanding and economic assistance in building fences not 
barriers

the kansas city mo times on ralph nader and thrifts 
ralph nader the consumer activist is angered by the 
administrations plan to restore stability in the thrift industry 
because this plan is to be financed in part by the treasury 
average taxpayers nader says should not be made to bear any 
part of the burden 
most of naders proposals read like something out of the 
stagflation 70s but one proposal for a 5 percent tax on stock 
sales would be especially damaging 
taxing these transactions would be contrary to the interests of 
every american who contributes and depends on a pension fund

the evening sun baltimore on john tower 
john tower promises he will quit drinking if he is confirmed 
as defense secretary 
but under the present circumstances taking the pledge begins to 
resemble a man who about to be thrown out of the house desperately 
promises his wife ill never take another drink 
but even if the nodrinking pledge is helpful sen sam nunn 
points out that a bad odor still hovers over tower because of his 
relations with defense contractors whom he served at great profit 
after leaving the senate in 1984 
tower maintains his consulting business violated neither law nor 
propriety dozens of other former lawmakers and bureaucrats tower 
points out have become consultants 
but in the arcane world of national security secrecy is the 
critical edge of advantage even if he betrayed no secrets to 
defense contractors tower unquestionably relied on his knowledge of 
those secrets in giving the advice for which he was so handsomely 
paid

the flint mich journal on john tower 
john towers pledge to swear off alcohol if he is approved as 
secretary of defense is no justification for the senate to confirm 
his nomination 
if he does still have a serious drinking problem this pledge 
is not enough he would need rehabilitation 
even more troubling however are the potential conflicts of 
interest involving towers dealings with defense contractors he 
left the senate as an arms negotiator in 1984 to become a highly 
paid consultant 
even though he reportedly did not violate any laws in his 
consulting business he profited handsomely from his willingness to 
trade on his government position and his knowledge of government 
secrets 
john tower has been a terrible nominee from the start a more 
thorough fbi investigation should have uncovered that 
the senate armed services committee the body that would have to 
work closest with tower was absolutely right in rejecting his 
nomination after its long and thoughtful hearings 
tower should step aside and president bush should put the 
interests of the defense department and the nation far ahead of his 
loyalty to his longtime texas friend

new jersey herald newton nj on unnecessary caesarean 
operations 
a study by public citizen a washington consumeradvocacy group 
showing that approximately 500000 caesarean sections were performed 
unnecessarily in us hospitals during 1987 raised frightful 
questions about the quality of medicine 
the study reported that caesarean operations climbed to a 
new high for a 12th straight year 
the group states that the use of caesarean sections rather 
than normal labor can increase the risk of death or illness for 
mothers substantially raise the cost of having a baby and exact a 
psychological toll on the mother 
the csection procedure of cutting through the abdomen and uterus 
to deliver the baby averages more than 3000 above the cost of 
vaginal deliveries 
if the medical profession cannot discipline its members against 
unnecessary dangerous and moneygrabbing surgery the undesirable 
alternative for society may well be to invite government 
surveillance and control of the profession

the journal new ulm minn on john tower 
dont get the idea that john tower was rejected as defense 
secretary by the senate armed services committee just because he has 
a reputation as a man who likes an occasional glass of wine and has 
an appreciation for a wellturned ankle 
lets put it on a slightly higher level 
lets look at towers background in defense as a senator tower 
was chairman of the armed services committee and he was wellknown 
as a senator who never met a defense system he didnt like as 
defense secretary more likely he would be a rubber stamp for any 
wish list the military gives him 
after he left the senate tower became a consultant to the 
defense industry in a couple of years he had received around a 
million dollars in consulting fees from defense contractors he and 
defense contractors get along very very well 
this is the man who is supposed to go before congress and make 
credible plausible arguments as to why we need this weapon or that 
defense system or why we should pay so much more money for this 
project 
the rumors of womanizing and drinking are the least of towers 
problems let the senate forget those rumors and judge the man 
solely on his defense background 
the vote against him should be overwhelming

the westerly ri sun on sewage treatment 
the new and higher environmental protection agency cost estimate 
for upgrading sewage treatment facilities prompted epa administrator 
william k reilly to say we must think cooperatively about how we 
are going to solve waste water treatment problems 
he seemed to have in mind with good reason not only 
collaboration in planning the execution of problems but also 
broader sharing of the enormous financial outlay required 
in its report to congress the agency set this at 835 billion 
the figure incidentally points up something we have cause to 
be glum about congress approved the clean water act in 1972 yet 17 
years later the problems it addresses still plague the nation 
with twothirds of the nations waste water treatment plants 
deficient in some way it is clear that we need to put more effort 
and that means more money into achieving what congress intended 17 
years ago

the morning news tribune tacoma wash on hirohitos funeral 
few americans would have blamed george bush had he chosen to skip 
emperor hirohitos funeral the president had personal reasons 
not to honor hirohitos memory 
like millions of other americans he was drawn unwillingly into 
world war ii as a result of japans attack on pearl harbor while 
serving as a naval aviator he was shot down by the japanese over 
the pacific ocean in 1944 
historians today dispute hirohitos role in the japanese 
aggressions of that era but theres no question the emperor at 
least reluctantly endorsed japans decision to wage war against the 
united states and other pacific powers 
by attending the funeral bush made it clear that what happened 
in the pacific nearly a halfcentury ago no longer has any bearing 
on americas relationship with japan and that relationship 
despite all the grumblings about trade balances is one of 
friendship 
world war ii is history americas future is now inseparable from 
japans nothing could demonstrate those realities better than 
george bushs presence in tokyo

the general assembly today approved 416 
million for the un peacekeeping mission to free namibia from 74 
years of south african rule 
on april 1 the world body plans to begin implementing a oneyear 
plan to create the worlds newest independent nation in the process 
settling the last major colonial problem in africa 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i when it 
captured the former german colony in december pretoria finally 
agreed to cooperate with the uns oneyear plan to make the 
territory a sovereign state 
the general assembly was able to clear the last hurdle to 
implementing the plan after its budget subcommittee overriding 
objections from several african nations decided tuesday night that 
un peacekeepers in namibia may buy goods from south africa as long 
as it continues to be the cheapest supplier 
countries led by zambia and zimbabwe had delayed approval of the 
assessment for the force by trying to make the united nations heed 
its own calls for trade embargoes on south african products 
britain france and the united states opposed the restrictions on 
purchases for the force citing the higher cost of buying goods and 
services elsewhere that are available from south africa 
late tuesday the assemblys budget committee adopted language 
that noted the embargoes but called on the united nations to buy 
from the lowest bidder among the widest possible sources of 
procurement in the interest of economy and efficiency 
a dejected zambian ambassador peter dingiswayo zuze said he 
viewed the compromise as the best as can be 
un fiscal controller luis maris gomez pledged that the world 
body would not buy helicopters from south africa as the black 
african states had feared 
he said peacekeeping troops would bring their own military 
vehicles but mineresistant vehicles would be needed in the early 
stage of the mission and these would likely be leased from south 
africa 
other un officials noted that south africa is readily able to 
supply the 102 million in gasoline and aviation fuel the namibia 
force will need 
the black african states had proposed that fuel be bought from 
angola or the congo a more expensive proposition 
in december the five permanent members of the security council 
had clashed with the black african states over the size and cost of 
the mission the africans wanted 7500 peacekeepers sent at a cost 
of up to 700 million 
the security council instead adopted the big five plan of sending 
just 4650 personnel with the rest held in reserve 
the big five the united states soviet union britain france 
and china pay 57 percent of all peacekeeping costs 
the un mission in namibia is to oversee november parliamentary 
elections in the territory also known as southwest africa 
south africa agreed to grant namibia independence as part of an 
accords signed in december that also call for the withdrawal from 
angola of an estimated 50000 cuban troops who have aided that 
countrys marxist government in a 14yearold war against south 
africansupported rebels

an everglades wildfire moved away from a major 
interstate power line today after firefighters in a helicopter 
dropped incendiary bombs the size of pingpong balls to create a 
buffer in the droughtparched region 
downpours that drenched parts of the southern florida coast 
tuesday brought only a few light showers to the fire zone but 
optimism grew today with more rain in the forecast 
were probably in better shape than we have been all week 
forestry division spokesman jim whitson said it looks like weve 
got some moisture coming into the state right now and things have 
cooled down considerably 
fanned by steady 10 mph winds the 3dayold blaze burned an 
estimated 12000 acres before stalling at a drainage canal at the 
palm beach county line northwest of fort lauderdale early this 
morning forestry officials said 
thick smoke from burning resins in sawgrass and melaleuca trees 
forced the florida highway patrol to close eight miles of highway 
for about an hour tuesday and prompted complaints from as far as 30 
miles away in palm beach state forestry spokesman john kern said 
firefighters dropped incendiary bombs from a helicopter to start 
backfires designed to keep the 10milelong wall of flame away from 
interstate power lines serving more than 3 million south florida 
residents 
florida power amp light co shut off power on the three 
500000volt lines for four hours during tuesdays operation no 
blackouts were reported in 1985 a fire that burned more than 
100000 acres engulfed power lines and caused widespread blackouts 
in southern florida 
today forestry officials on the western side of the everglades 
contained a 4050acre fire that burned through cypress and 
palmettodotted scrubland duty officer debra carter said officials 
planned to use incendiary bombs on the blaze later today to burn 
remaining fuel 
that blaze was stalled just south of alligator alley a twolane 
highway connecting fort lauderdale to the gulf coast said fort 
myers forestry officer roberta smith 
the two wildfires were the largest of more than 65 fires the 
forestry division has fought since monday with about 400 
firefighters said charles maynard spokesman for the agency in 
tallahassee 
tuesdays rainfall caused flooding that closed the main runway at 
fort lauderdalehollywood international airport for two hours the 
rain also caused a rushhour mudslide onto interstate 95 that backed 
traffic up for six miles 
but little of it hit wilderness areas where rainfall has 
averaged less than half normal levels since last fall 
the national weather service forecast scattered showers in some 
parts of the state over the next few days but nothing that would 
alleviate the growing fire danger maynard said

south carolina today banned hazardous waste 
shipments from 32 states and puerto rico that have not begun 
creating their own dumps 
as trucks that come from an area thats banned were going 
to turn the truck back and if at all possible escort them back to 
the state line said bill culler of the state department of health 
and environmental control 
the ban applied to a commercial landfill operated here by gsx 
services it is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfills 
in the southeast 
most landfill customers had been notified of the ban but the 
department increased the number of inspectors monitoring the 
landfill from three to 10 today to watch for unexpected loads from 
banned states culler said 
it will have a tremendous impact on our business gsx vice 
president roger davis said we just think its a good business 
decision not to challenge it 
the ban announced tuesday affects such heavy landfill users as 
florida and north carolina 
it results from gov carroll campbells jan 18 executive order 
that south carolina would prohibit beginning march 1 the disposal 
of waste from any state that refused to dispose of the waste itself 
we hope our actions will encourage other states to move toward 
developing their own hazardous waste management programs said 
hartsill truesdale head of the state health departments hazardous 
waste division 
it was both the failure of other states to aggressively address 
their waste disposal problems and the growing imbalance in waste 
disposal that prompted governor campbell to issue this executive 
order 
the massive gsx landfill on the shore of lake marion annually 
accepts 135000 tons of hazardous waste such as solvents acids and 
other chemical garbage about 70 percent comes from out of state 
the other hazardous waste landfill in the southeast is in emelle 
ala 
the governors spokesman tucker eskew said he believed 
campbells message to other states would come across if its not 
good enough for you its not good enough for us 
campbell has said that any state would have to remove disposal 
prohibitions before the ban could be lifted 
north carolina responded to the ban with the introduction of a 
bill tuesday that renews that states search for a hazardous waste 
treatment plant though it fails to specify when a site would be 
chosen 
south carolina state sen phil leventis a longtime landfill 
opponent said other states should have working disposal sites 
before being allowed to send south carolina their waste 
anybody that promises us that with a little revision of a law 
that their state is soon going to be handling its own hazardous 
waste is simply telling us the check is in the mail leventis said 
the banned states shipped about 45 percent of the waste handled 
by the dump in 1987 according to the latest figures available 
in addition to puerto rico florida and north carolina the 
following states are affected by the ban alaska arizona 
california colorado idaho illinois indiana iowa kansas 
louisiana maine mississippi missouri nebraska new hampshire 
new mexico north dakota ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania 
rhode island south dakota tennessee utah vermont washington

immigration agents today took into custody 
27 more suspected illegal aliens on a flight bound for new york 
bringing to 175 the number seized in a threeday crackdown on alien 
smuggling rings 
immigration and naturalization service officials in atlanta 
whose jurisdiction includes charlotte said the 27 were on a 
piedmont airlines flight from phoenix 
the 27 who are from mexico brazil and el salvador were taken 
off the plane during a stopover here at 640 am the ins said 
they had flown to phoenix on an america west airlines flight from 
los angeles late tuesday officials said 
an irate citizen called our office tuesday morning and 
claimed to be a commuter aboard the piedmont flight said david 
carmichael supervisory ins agent in charlotte the source 
suggested we check flight 1522 
thomas fischer ins district director in atlanta said the aliens 
caught today apparently paid 2000 apiece for the trip which he 
described as part of a massive smuggling ring 
los angeles is literally saturated with aliens said neil 
jacobs assistant ins director for investigations in atlanta the 
word has spread that la is not the place to obtain employment 
fischer said this was the third time ins agents had apprehended 
illegal aliens on the piedmont flight fifteen people were caught in 
charlotte on oct 6 and 17 more oct 12 he said 
on monday ins agents apprehended 79 suspected illegal aliens 
aboard an eastern airlines that stops in atlanta en route from los 
angeles to new york 
sixtynine more aliens were taken into custody in los angeles 
monday night as they attempted to board the same flight 
the ins said a man believed to be a leader of a smuggling ring 
jorge guzmanromero a 42yearold mexican was arrested along with 
the 69 in los angeles 
immigration officials stressed that several independent smugglers 
may have been using easterns red eye flight 80 to ferry illegal 
aliens to the east coast and that the group arrested in los angeles 
was not necessarily linked to those seized in atlanta 
this was a concurrent parallel investigation that will 
continue until we close this route we suspect there will be other 
routes donald h looney acting district director of the 
immigration and naturalization service in los angeles said tuesday 
authorities said the chief smuggling operators remain at large 
but they described guzmanromero as a leader 
were not as close as wed like to be wed like to have the 
ringleaders in handcuffs said thomas gaines ins assistant 
district director for antismuggling 
guzmanromero was charged with transporting at least three 
illegal aliens us magistrate volney v brown declined to set bail 
tuesday saying guzmanromero has no ties to the los angeles area 
gaines said investigators received tips that several groups used 
easterns latenight flight to new york 
we feel like we have a number of individual smugglers who are 
utilizing a rather low airfare to move their aliens away from the 
border from los angeles and on up to the east coast gaines said 
at a news conference 
smugglers often appear early at the ticket counter and pay cash 
for a block of tickets officials said 
the 69 aliens caught in los angeles allegedly paid up to 4000 
for a package that probably included crossing the border passage to 
a drop house and the crosscountry flight gaines said he said he 
didnt know if the package included finding employment 
fiftyfour were from mexico seven from el salvador and four each 
from colombia and guatemala looney said 
ins spokesman joe flanders said most of the people if found to 
be illegal aliens would be given the choice of going home or 
requesting a deportation hearing he said some might be held as 
material witnesses 
tom thomas a spokesman for the ins in atlanta said thousands of 
illegal aliens may have been shuttled across the country on the 
eastern flight nearly every day for the past 30 days 
gaines refused to speculate on how many illegal aliens may have 
used the flights but said the technique is not new recalling at 
least one sweep in recent years that netted 200 people 
both thomas in atlanta and looney in los angeles said eastern 
airlines was not a target of the investigation eastern cooperated 
with the ins on the atlanta arrests officials said

its border with austria will be dismantled by january 1991 partly 
because of too many false alarms official reports said wednesday 
a report submitted to the communist partys politburo said 
guarding the borders poses a growing burden for guards thanks to 
the fact that hungarys ties with the world have expanded the 
government news agency reported 
in an interview published in the government newspaper magyar 
hirlap the commander of the western hungary border zone said the 
guards wholeheartedly support the initiative it is an outdated 
system 
col istvan franko quoted the guards as saying the technical 
warning system posed a physical and mental stress for them 
franko said that in the sopron border region alone 4374 alarms 
were registered last year of which only 44 were actual border 
violations 
ninetythree percent of the violations were committed by foreign 
citizens mainly east germans heading for austria

a court has acquitted two missionaries 
from the united states and canada on charges of proselytizing and 
they said after spending four months in prison awaiting trial that 
they want to leave the hindu kingdom as soon as possible 
weve had enough of nepal david mcbride of columbia pa 
told the associated press on wednesday we are going to go home 
mcbride and mervyn budd of london ontario were acquitted 
tuesday on charges of preaching christianity and causing a 
disturbance to hinduism 
mcbride 33 and budd 26 arrived wednesday in katmandu from the 
town of phidim 150 miles to the east where they were arrested oct 
27 at the end of a fiveweek trek of the himalayan foothills 
they were arrested on charges of proselytizing punishable by up 
to six years in prison 
the constitution declares that nepal is a hindu state and the 
law bans conversion from hinduism to another religion 
mcbride and budd had pleaded innocent the court ordered them 
held because nepalese law does not permit bail for foreigners who 
face sentences of more than six months 
police had confiscated books on christianity in the nepali 
limbu sherpa tibetan english and german languages as well as 
cassette tapes they allegedly sold during their trek 
justice ek raj acharya acquitted them because of lack of evidence 
mcbrides wife connie embraced him after he arrived by plane in 
katmandu 
for me it is a miracle that they are released she said 
i am happy to be out mcbride said but there are a lot of 
people that need to be out of that jail too 
he said at least twothirds of the 46 others in the prison were 
innocent at least that is what i think from my conversations with 
them they are not guilty but they have staying longer than me 
some of them cant afford lawyers some of them just stay there 
mcbride and budd were affiliated with the operation mobilization 
a londonbased christian organization 
an official with the organization mike wakely said the two had 
received 2000 cards and letters from all over the world while in 
jail on tuesday alone he said they received 243 letters 
their 90day visas expired while they were in prison but 
officials were working to clear the paperwork so they could leave 
nepal 
this will be just a formality they would be free to go 
home according to an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
last month three hindus who converted to christianity were 
sentenced to one year in prison by a court in bhadrapur 190 miles 
southeast of katmandu a nepalese news agency reported

the use of soviet citizens to spy on one another 
does not conflict with the principles of glasnost according to a 
kgb official 
the organs of the kgb have always regarded and still regard the 
organization of work with citizens written and verbal information 
as one of the forms of their participation in ensuring state 
security said ap burakov the kgb chief in mariyskaya 450 
miles east of moscow he made his comments in wednesdays editions 
of the newspaper izvestia in reply to a readers query in another 
newspaper 
the reader asked the other newspaper mariyskaya pravda how the 
use of kgb informants in virtually every work collective fitted into 
the era of glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
greater openness in soviet society 
in accordance with the constitution of the ussr every 
citizen is obliged to render the necessary assistance and 
cooperation in ensuring state security burakov said an 
overwhelming majority of the people to whom we have to appeal for 
such help is willing to render it to us 
in a rare and candid glimpse into the workings of the secret 
police force burakov also said the kgb had a network of what he 
called freelance employees 
however he said their number was few and that their activities 
were confined to large enterprises that were carefully regulated 
he did not elaborate on what the freelance employees did 
but said regular agents of the kgb are acting openly and they are 
known by many people

a highlevel advisory group once seen as the 
best hope for crafting a bipartisan solution to the nations budget 
problems ended up deadlocked issuing a final report today that 
splits essentially along party lines 
the seven republicans on the national economic commission and the 
one democrat appointed by president bush endorsed the presidents 
pledge against raising taxes and praised his budget submission to 
congress calling it a workable plan for eliminating the deficit 
by 1993 
however the six democrats on the panel who were appointed by the 
congressional leadership signed a minority report calling bushs 
budget neither theoretically sound nor politically realistic 
the administrations 116 trillion spending plan for 1990 
rules out any discussion of additional revenues and relies heavily 
on harsh and disproportionate reductions in domestic spending the 
democrats said 
the sharply divergent reports ended up echoing the current debate 
between bush and congressional democrats where both sides remain 
far apart on solutions to a budget crisis which is expected to 
produce a deficit of 170 billion this year 
asked if the administration was disappointed that the panel had 
failed its mission to come up with a bipartisan formula for reducing 
the budget deficit white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
they did an excellent job in trying to carry out their mandate 
it was a very difficult debate and discussion that they held 
some of the things in that report are very useful and well 
have to analyze it for a more detailed respnse he added they 
did the best they could fitzwater said 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif called 
the commissions report disappointing but said it was not 
surprising 
with little support or leadership from the president or the 
congress the commission was unable to face up to the difficult 
issues he said in a written statement it had no choice but to 
punt 
the commission which now goes out of existence was a deep 
disappointment to supporters who pushed legislation creating the 
panel through congress in the wake of the october 1987 stock market 
crash 
their hopes were that a panel of the nations top business labor 
and political leaders would be able to agree on a combination of 
spending cuts and tax increases to solve a deficit problem which has 
almost tripled the national debt over the past eight years 
but while campaigning for the white house bush was openly 
critical of the commission which had the backing of his republican 
primary opponent sen bob dole rkan bush vowed to reject any 
final report which called for a tax increase 
the commissions democratic cochairman robert strauss said he 
had hoped for a great deal more but that the commissions fate 
was sealed by bushs campaign against tax increases 
strauss and republican cochairman drew lewis had hoped at one 
time to adopt an ambitious package that would cut 50 billion to 60 
billion from the deficit in part by raising taxes 
but strauss drew criticism from within his own party last fall 
when he suggested cuts in government benefit programs including 
social security would be needed to balance the governments books 
not everyone was disappointed in the outcome of the panels work 
dean kleckner a republican member of the commission who was an 
outspoken opponent of tax increases said the majority report 
reflected the will of taxpayers throughout the nation 
testimony to the commission from 85 witnesses and more than 
1300 responses from private citizens and groups this past 11 months 
clearly indicated opposition to higher taxes and irresponsible 
spending kleckner said 
sen patrick moynihan dny another commission member said he 
was pleased that both the republican and democratic reports 
criticized continued use of social security payroll taxes to mask 
the extent of the budget deficit 
both reports called for a goal of not simply eliminating the 
deficit but achieving surpluses to build up the funds necessary to 
cover the retirement of the baby boom generation 
both reports endorsed the need to reform the congressional budget 
process with the republicans offering a detailed list of 
suggestions many of them long championed by ronald reagan and now 
bush 
they include a constitutional balancedbudget amendment 
presidential lineitem veto authority in spending bills a 
streamlined congressional process for making budget decisions and 
twoyear rather than annual budgets 
commission member rep william h gray iii dpa a former house 
budget committee chairman blamed partisanship by republicans for 
the groups failure to succeed 
the president didnt want a bipartisan deficit reduction plan 
he wanted his own plan the flexible freeze and he insisted on it 
from republican members gray said in an interview instead of 
something bold that could have moved us forward we end up leaving 
it to congress and the administration to continue the fight 
while bush criticized the commission during the campaign he did 
appoint the final two members in december former sen paul laxalt 
rnev and longtime friend thomas lud ashley a former 
democratic congressman from ohio 
after taking office bush decided against extending the panels 
march 1 reporting deadline for another six months a step many on 
the panel had urged as a way of keeping the commission alive in the 
hopes that it eventually could reach a consensus 
that decision basically sealed the panels fate and with only a 
few weeks remaining the panel abandoned efforts for any compromise 
and began drafting majority and minority reports 
in addition to strauss moynihan and gray the other democrats on 
the panel were chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca aflcio 
president lane kirkland and felix rohatyn a new york investment 
banker 
in addition to kleckner and lewis who is chairman of union 
pacific the other republicans on the panel were sen pete domenici 
of new mexico rep bill frenzel of minnesota caspar weinberger 
former defense secretary in the reagan administration and donald 
rumsfeld former defense secretary in the ford administration

michele knight slopped a jumbo can of cream of 
mushroom soup into a pot and stirred a sight youd never see at 
her verdi restaurant where a meal can cost an easy 40 and strains 
of puccini accompany the pasta 
robert miller a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser biceps 
bulging from his tshirt looked on along with nancy silverton a 
former pastry chef at starstudded spago and michaels in los 
angeles and maxwells plum in new york 
ms silverton resumed her demonstration of how to section an 
orange 
they taste so much less bitter if you cut them away from the 
membranes said ms silverton author of desserts and about to 
open her own restaurant 
sage black pepper said tevis runyan the executive chef at 
duc duc mousse catering we sure wont need any salt 
the slightly surrealistic scene played out last week at the union 
rescue mission where some of the citys top chefs showed 
soupkitchen cooks like miller how to ladle out tastier and 
healthier fare to the 2400 homeless people who crowd in daily for 
free meals 
miller a former army and shortorder cook who is halfway through 
an eightmonth drug and alcohol recovery program watched ruth 
hedges slam a head of lettuce down pop out the core slice away 
brownish leaves and hold the remainder up for inspection 
if you went to todays expensive restaurants youd only get 
the inside third of that just the heart she said 
no ones proposing serving haute cuisine on skid row said ms 
hedges who runs a company that provides food to tony private 
schools and theaters and whose womens culinary alliance organized 
the monthly teaching sessions 
its more a matter of souping up whatever is on hand like 
turkey tetrazzini for 900 which incorporated two cases of cream of 
mushroom soup 100 pounds of pasta and a couple of cases of frozen 
peas 
at the classes held during regular meal preparation hours in the 
mission kitchen the master chefs and the mission cooks face off 
across a table to prepare food together it is then served to the 
transients who stream in off main street and hunker at the rough 
wooden tables 
most of the lessons are simple dont oversaute season food 
before popping it in the oven dont cook the taste and vitamins 
out said ms runyan the caterer 
at the first session last month for example chefs from the 
vogue city restaurant and angeli explained how to use up leftovers 
by making vegetable frittatas italianstyle omelettes 
you can use up all your old produce just throw it in the egg 
mixture and bake it plus its simple to do ms runyan said 
the really important thing is that it is going to be 
nutritionally balanced said ms hedges those people out there 
have a lot greater nutritional needs than you or me the meal 
they get here may be their only one of the day 
members of the womens culinary alliance a networking 
foodindustry group at first merely gathered leftovers to donate to 
the mission said ms hedges 
but then i came down here one day and i saw the kitchen and i 
realized that this was where we could really focus on education 
she said 
it looks as though the mission will get a whole new kitchen for 
free along with the cooking tips 
shel brucker president of avery services corp which designs 
and supplies restaurants unveiled the plans and said he was 
confident his suppliers would contribute materials so the 
restoration could be complete by years end 
miller the former army cook said he welcomed the chefs advice 
its more than just thrown together now he said theres 
more of a menu and the food is seasoned properly

oliver norths courier to the contras robert 
owen testified today that north repeatedly told him he had 
authorization from his superiors for all his activities on behalf of 
the nicaraguan contras 
under crossexamination owen also said he met with at least half 
a dozen cia agents in central american countries to discuss supply 
efforts to the contras at a time when congress had banned military 
aid to the guerrillas the agents were referred to in the courtroom 
by number 
owen detailed the political sensitivity of handling the supply 
operation which involved shipping goods through honduras and costa 
rica before they got into the contras hands 
in connection with efforts to build a clandestine airstrip in 
costa rica owen said that costa rican officials wanted to be 
helpful while trying to maintain a veneer of neutrality 
owen agreed with north lawyer brendan sullivan during questioning 
that north had said numerous times that in assisting the contras he 
was carrying out the instructions of his superiors including 
the president 
after a brief recess however owen was questioend closely by 
prosecutors about whether north specifically mentioned any of the 
superiors he was talking about owen replied that north never said 
anything indicating that he was acting with the knowledge of 
president reagan or that the president told him to lie or that the 
president told him to conceal what he was doing owen also said that 
north did not specifically mention the names of former national 
security advisers robert mcfarlane or john poindexter 
he always used the word superior owen said 
us district judge gerhard a gesell asked for dates but owen 
was unable to provide them 
meanwhile the government filed a memorandum in the latest 
dispute over classified information in the case 
sullivan has renewed a motion to declare that a federal law 
designed to protect state secrets from being spilled in the 
courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the north case 
the process of handling classified material in court is not as 
north contends a reason to conclude that the trial is unworkable 
said the filing by john keker head of the prosecution team 
norths lawyers said they first found out monday night that memos 
from owen to north which the government claimed were classified had 
already been made public 
at a hearing tuesday gesell said he will reconsider how he will 
handle classified material at norths trial 
for 2 weeks a jury has been ready to try this case and hasnt 
been able to try it said gesell now i hear we are dealing with 
classified documents that can be classified ex post facto or 
after the fact 
the memos written by robert owen a onetime courier for north 
were censored before the trial by us intelligence agencies which 
claimed that release could endanger national security however the 
same memos had already been turned over to a private group in a 
separate legal case eight months before 
owens lawyer thomas hylden turned over copies of the memos 
last june to the christic institute as part of a lawsuit the 
activist group filed alleging a criminal conspiracy to supply the 
nicaraguan contra rebels in the memos owen spelled out for his 
boss a wealth of detail about the private contra supply network 
overseen by north 
north is accused of lying to congress and the attorney general 
about secret reagan administration efforts to aid the contras when 
congress had banned us aid to the rebels 
the trial was halted monday when norths lawyers wanted to use 
the name of a costa rican official former security minister 
benjamin piza from one of owens memos in crossexamining owen 
pizas name had been censored by us intelligence agencies 
owens lawyer thomas hylden had informed independent counsel 
lawrence walshs office on feb 10 that the christic institute 
already had the memos but norths lawyers said they didnt find out 
about it until monday night when they were notified by hylden 
prosecutors working for walsh said inaction by the office 
security director and inattention on their part rather than any 
intent to hide information was the reason norths lawyers hadnt 
been notified 
the defense alleged prosecutorial misconduct but gesell said he 
was not trying to look for sanctions against anyone however 
the judge said he was concerned about getting to the bottom of 
whats going on regarding the use of classified information at the 
trial 
my concern is whether this presents an example of looseness in 
governmental dealings with this problem of classified information 
he said 
the judge questioned whether all his pretrial work on rules for 
handling such information would have to be done over 
gesell noted that he had a continuing motion from norths lawyers 
asking whether a fair trial is possible under rules set by a law 
governing disclosure of state secrets at trial 
gesell said the question of a mistrial is out of the 
question a reference to the difficulty in getting a jury that was 
ignorant of norths testimony at the televised irancontra hearings 
in 1987 
this case can never be tried again he said

vietnamese farmer dien tan sang plans to return 
to his impoverished homeland thursday because his dreams of a new 
life abroad quickly evaporated inside hong kongs cramped detention 
camps 
dien his wife and three children have languished in the camps 
ever since they fled communist vietnam and sailed north to this 
british colony on the china coast seven months ago 
with dim prospects for resettlement and a gnawing concern for his 
parents back home dien has decided his family will join 68 other 
volunteers and fly to vietnam in the first largescale repatriation 
of boat people from hong kong 
im not clear if they hanoi officials will punish us or 
not dien 30 said at the spartan argyle street holding center 
im not afraid 
un officials have promised to closely monitor hanois treatment 
of the returning boat people and fazlul karim head of the un 
agency overseeing the repatriation said even at the hanoi 
airport if they do not want to get down from the aircraft they will 
not be dragged down 
the fate of dien is of more than passing interest to hong kong 
which is straining under the weight of more than 25000 boat people 
if he is treated well officials say more vietnamese may go back 
if the repatriation is successful and word gets back we 
hope this will lead to further requests by people in camps in hong 
kong to return to vietnam secretary of security geoffrey barnes 
said at a news conference 
hong kong long has classified all boat people as refugees 
eligible for resettlement and between 1979 and 1988 only 22 of more 
than 100000 arrivals voluntarily returned home 
but to stem the growing tide of vietnamese arrivals hong kong 
adopted a new policy under which most boat people arriving after 
june 15 are considered illegal immigrants subject to forcible 
repatriation only a small fraction that can prove they fled 
persecution are eligible for resettlement 
more than 10000 boat people have arrived since the change and 
some have registered their displeasure with the new policy by 
staging hunger strikes and refusing to be interviewed by hong kong 
officials 
a few have even asked for new boats to head for friendlier ports 
although the government is unlikely to honor the request 
other new arrivals appear convinced their future lies back home 
and about 300 names have been submitted to hanoi although some have 
since backed out 
after the united nations high commission for refugees and vietnam 
signed an agreement in december to set up a program of voluntary 
repatriation a fourmember hanoi delegation came to hong kong in 
february to issue travel documents for the first 81 boat people to 
go home that number later dropped to 73 after some people backed 
out at the last minute 
the group is to fly home on a jet chartered from hong kongbased 
dragon air and be accompanied by at least one un official each 
repatriated vietnamese will receive a kit of basic supplies such as 
clothing and household utensils said karim the head of the un 
commission in hong kong 
vietnam has said quite clearly there would be no 
prosecution or any punitive or discriminatory measures karim said 
un officials will be allowed full access to monitor the 
repatriated boat people he said 
despite the assurances only a tiny minority of boat people have 
offered to go home and it is unclear how many more may follow 
in fact the flow of boat people leaving vietnam may again be on 
the rise during the first 23 days of february 328 vietnamese 
sailed into the territory compared with 114 for all of january and 
91 in february 1988 
it certainly points to the fact that the new policy in and of 
itself is obviously not a deterrent said one western 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a key deterrent in the new policy is forcible repatriation of 
boat people classified as illegal immigrants but vietnam only 
accepts voluntary returnees 
akber khan a hong kong government spokesman said before 
repatriation of boat people classified as illegal immigrants can 
begin hanoi must agree to accept them offer assurances of safety 
and allow international monitoring of the program 
an international meeting to discuss repatriation of boat people 
will be held in kuala lumpur malaysia next month and hanoi is 
expected to attend 
meanwhile resettlement of the approximately 15000 vietnamese in 
hong kong camps granted refugee status received a recent boost with 
several countries including the united states australia canada 
and great britain agreeing to increase the number they accept 
officials believe 4000 refugees may be resettled this year up 
from 2772 last year and 2212 in 1987

year after a communist coup prompted the moslem guerrilla revolt 
about 250000 government security forces hold key afghan cities

william j bennett jr president bushs choice 
to run the nations war on drugs said today that despite 
pessimistic talk about his chances for success he believes he can 
help bring some change for the better soon 
at his confirmation hearing as director of national drug control 
policy bennett told the senate judiciary committee ive been 
struck these last few weeks as ive met with people inside 
government and out by the pessimism even fatalism people have 
about our mission in the war on drugs 
some have told me they wouldnt wish this job on their worst 
enemy others have made clear they think the war is already lost 
he said i think we must disagree there are things that can be 
done 
bennett said he shared the concern of committee chairman joseph 
r biden jr ddel about promising too much too soon 
but at the same time i remain convinced that concerted 
intelligent effort and strategy if implemented can bring change 
for the better and bring some change for the better soon said 
bennett who was education secretary during the reagan 
administration 
biden extended some bipartisan support to bennett saying he 
would run political interference for him if necessary 
biden told bennett at the opening of his confirmation hearing 
that as long as you make a goodfaith effort to comply with this 
statute creating the post you will have my personal and political 
support 
i personally will run all the political interference that you 
need said biden who worked for eight years to create the drug 
czar position 
although the overwhelming tenor of the opening statements by 
committee members was supportive of bennett sen paul simon 
dill said he was somewhat troubled by the nomination and 
might not vote for him 
if we were to elect a national gadfly in this area you would 
have my vote simon said 
the senator said that when bennett was education secretary and 
complained about the drug problem he told other cabinet secretaries 
the secretaries of state and defense and the attorney general 
among others what they should be doing to fight the drug battle 
in your own department where you had a chance to do something 
you asked for a cut in onehalf of the money for the drug problem 
simon said 
if i vote no and i think i may be the only one i hope you do 
a job that will make my vote wrong simon said 
bennett was introduced and endorsed by four senators and a house 
member sens daniel patrick moynihan dny alfonse m damato 
rny jesse helms rnc and terry sanford dnc and rep 
charles rangel dny chairman of the house select committee on 
narcotics abuse and control 
biden reiterated today his criticism of bush for not giving 
bennett cabinet status 
at one time or another you will have to go to the mat with 
everyone of your cabinet colleagues and you need to meet them on 
equal terms in the decisive forum the cabinet room he said 
biden described the job before bennett as a herculean task and 
said bennett was bound to fail in some of his efforts 
however biden said he would only criticize bennett if he failed 
to come up with a strategy to deal with the drug problem and did not 
take full advantage of the powers his position holds 
he said the position may be our last best chance to take hold 
of an epidemic wave of drug abuse 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina the ranking republican on 
the judiciary committee praised bennett and said his initial doubts 
about the wisdom of appointing one person to coordinate all federal 
antidrug activities had been relieved 
in advance of the hearing biden said in a television interview 
today that bennetts pugnacious reputation as education secretary in 
the reagan administration will serve him well in his new job 
bennett is going to have to be combative hes going to have to 
be tough hes going to have to be a real scrapper biden said on 
abcs good morning america 
the very things that made bill bennett controversial as 
secretary of education are things that may make him particularly 
useful as the socalled drug czar biden said he was never 
afraid of controversy he was never afraid of being critical 
this first drug director is going to have to be willing to take 
on other cabinet members and going to have to be willing to be 
controversial the committee chairman said 
according to the bill passed last year creating the post the 
director must compile in his first 180 days a comprehensive drug 
control strategy encompassing all aspects of the battle against 
illegal drugs from law enforcement here and abroad to treatment 
programs for addicts 
it may be that hes already leaped the toughest personal hurdle 
as he quit his twopackaday cigarette smoking habit tell said 
although biden said he doesnt care about the smoking bennett 
made a commitment jan 12 the day president bush nominated him to 
become drug director to stop smoking by the time he took office 
he kicked the habit by attending a stopsmoking clinic called 
breathe free when he his wife elayne and son john went to the 
coolfont resort in berkeley springs wva last week tell said 
i went in his office and theres no ashtray said tell but 
there are some crutches a bowl of fruit and lollipops

baltimores school district has bowed out of a 
national program to overhaul the way ycnence is taught because the 
superintendent says he doesnt want his teachers to lose classroom 
time working on thesoject 
superintendent richard c hunter said the district will not 
participate in the fouryear 10 million project an unprecedented 
nationwide effort to help american students catch up with their 
peers in other countries 
project 2061 sponsored by the american association for the 
advancement of science and several other scientific institutions 
will bring teachers together often with top scientists to rethink 
the way science math and history are taught 
baltimore was invited to participate along with the school 
systems of san francisco san diego and san antonio texas two 
smaller systems in georgia and one in wisconsin 
to have baltimore out there as one of the national leaders 
would have been nice f james rutherford director of the 
project said in todays the baltimore sun 
i must say in a way its sad because baltimore is really a 
very special place if it works it will really be one of the most 
important changes in education in a long time 
hunter told rutherford that he did not want to spare teachers 
from the citys classrooms 
the plan would have required 20 teachers to be out of class three 
or four days a month and meet during the summer as well for the 
next two to three years 
i cant blame him said rutherford our project would put a 
tremendous demand on a district the superintendent felt that given 
his agenda it was just too ambitious a project for him to get into 
rutherford said the project named for the year in which halleys 
comet will return plans to arrange for substitute teachers to help 
districts that take part

a federal judge today threw out an naacp 
lawsuit seeking to remove the confederate flag atop alabamas 
capitol ruling the banner did not violate the constitutional rights 
of blacks 
us district judge robert varner said the naacp failed to show 
that the flying of the flag somehow created a form of segregation 
former state rep thomas reed and 13 other black legislators 
attempted to remove the flag in 1988 but were blocked by law 
enforcement officers and arrested they were convicted of 
trespassing and fined 
later reed state president of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and the naacp sued to remove the 
banner 
removal of the flag is suggested for the purpose of relieving a 
feeling of mr reed and his fellow blacks rather than for the 
purpose of eliminating segregation in state government varner 
wrote 
he pointed out that reed and other blacks were a part of state 
government and had not been ostracized by any means 
gov guy hunt has said he will remove the flag only at the 
request of the legislature which has killed past such attempts

killing a policeman 
manfred grashof was convicted of killing a hamburg policeman in a 
1972 gun battle and of being an accessory to the murder of a second

state governer bernhard vogel the pardon specified the march 1 
release date 
vogel said at the time that grashof 42 had clearly 
demonstrated that he had renounced terrorism 
in june vogel pardoned grashofs accomplice in the bank robbery 
klaus juenschke who had also received a life sentence for murder 
terrorist pardons are an emotional issue in west germany with 
proponents saying the government should show mercy where prisoners 
repudiate violent crimes opponents contend terrorists should pay in 
full for the bloody bombings and assassinations that rocked west 
germany in the late 1960s and 1970s

richard m daleys democratic primary victory over 
mayor eugene sawyer carried him to the door of the city hall office 
his father held for 21 years but a new foe and an old nemesis want 
to bar his entry 
by defeating sawyer tuesday daley advanced to the april 4 
general election and a contest democrats have won without fail since 
1931 including six straight terms captured by richard j daley 
the late legendary boss of chicago politics 
the 46yearold white nominee faces thirdparty candidate 
alderman timothy evans previously sawyers chief black rival and 
now jesse jacksons choice he also faces the republican primary 
winner a title claimed by edward vrdolyak who bucked gop leaders 
by launching a writein candidacy a week ago 
daley cook county states attorney rarely invoked his fathers 
name during the primary but he did in his victory statements and in 
tv interviews this morning 
i think my fathers looking down upon me on a beautiful warm 
day in chicago very proud of me and most importantly proud of 
the type of campaign that i ran in the last three months reaching 
out to every community daley said 
he dismissed suggestions that racial factors could split the vote 
as it did in 1983 when he lost the nomination to the late harold 
washington the citys first black mayor 
im not going to be vying for any one vote he said im 
going to be vying for votes of everybody throughout this city this 
is a city made up of the black community the white community the 
asian community the hispanic community and theyre all stressing 
issues this will be a good clean election 
daley recalled advice he received from his father who died in 
1976 three months into his third decade in office 
youre going to have ups and downs youre going to win youre 
going to lose he recalled his father saying remember 
choosing politics is your decision 
with 2843 of 2911 precincts reporting or 98 percent 
unofficial totals showed daley with 481370 votes or 56 percent to 
367919 votes or 43 percent for the black acting mayor three 
other candidates shared the remaining votes 
this is not the end of eugene sawyer said the 54yearold 
sawyer in conceding i will continue to work to heal to build 
and to bring people together in this city 
evans began the day today campaigning at an elevated train stop 
pledging to crush the daley machine he asked the crowd 
repeatedly can we win as supporters responded yes 
vrdolyak had no formal appearances scheduled early today 
daley rode overwhelming white support to win capping a 
threemonth campaign that was largely free of racial strife and by 
chicago standards rancor 
but vrdolyak a former democratic alderman and county party 
chairman could cut into that base if his writein challenge is 
successful vrdolyak won more than 80 percent of the white vote in 
his unsuccessful 1987 thirdparty challenge against washington 
with 96 percent of 2911 precincts reporting unofficial results 
gave vrdolyak 10711 votes or 45 percent to 10234 votes or 43 
percent to gop endorsed candidate dr herbert sohn two others each 
had 5 percent 
you made history vrdolyak told cheering supporters you 
did something in seven days that no one has seen before you showed 
that you can write someone in for mayor of chicago 
sohn refused to concede and county gop chairman jim dvorak said 
the race was too close to call because of the difficulty of 
counting writein votes the outcome of the republican race might 
not be known before thursday 
if daley faces vrdolyak and evans next month the battle would be 
reminiscent of the one washington waged to become the citys first 
black mayor 
washington narrowly won the 1983 democratic primary when the 
younger daley and incumbent jane byrne split the white vote he then 
rode monolithic black support to squeak past republican bernard 
epton in a racially charged campaign 
washington gained additional support from liberal whites and 
hispanics to repeat in 1987 becoming the first mayor since the 
elder daley to win reelection 
and also like the elder daley washington died in office without 
having annointed a successor touching off a war between sawyer and 
evans that caused a deep rift in the black community 
their struggle intensified after sawyer was elected in december 
1987 to succeed washington by a city council coalition of mostly 
white aldermen when the illinois supreme court last november 
ordered a special mayoral election to complete the final two years 
of washingtons term evans said he would run a thirdparty bid to 
give sawyer a clear shot at daley 
but sawyer supporters said evans sabotaged the mayors chances by 
helping hold down black voter turnout and refusing jacksons pleas 
for black unity against daley 
the negative campaign launched by alderman evans lasted for 
a long time and that caused some confusion in the black community 
it wasnt until really midjanuary before we could bring it all 
together and of course that had an impact said sawyer campaign 
manager reynard rochon 
in order to gain the mayoralty daley again will have to overcome 
formidable opposition from jackson who engineered sawyers surge 
among black voters in the waning days of the primary 
jackson said he felt no obligation to endorse daley because he 
did not receive daleys backing when he ran unsuccessfully for the 
democratic presidential nomination last year 
evans and jackson said the challenge would be to reassemble the 
coalition that elected washington 
somebody has to rise above the eyeforaneye and break that 
cycle of pain the bitterness at this point is substantial 
jackson said 
we believe that those who fought the daley machine tonight 
ought to be congratulated they tried their best we invite them now 
to join with us said evans

a state appeals court today overturned the 
murder conviction of randall dale adams in the 1976 slaying of a 
dallas police officer a case resurrected by the film the thin 
blue line 
in a unanimous decision the texas court of criminal appeals said 
prosecutors suppressed evidence during adams 1977 trial and used 
perjured testimony 
when deceit produces court rulings that have the effect of 
denying one a fair trial then the conviction should be vacated 
wrote judge mp duncan 
the appeals court ordered adams transferred from prison to the 
dallas county jail in dallas assistant district attorney norm 
kinne said adams will be held there while prosecutors decide whether 
to retry him 
we have one of the prosecutors reviewing evidence and 
interviewing witnesses in the case were in process of determining 
whether we have sufficient evidence for a retrial the district 
attorney said 
adams 40 had maintained that he was innocent he received the 
death penalty in 1977 for the slaying of officer robert wood but 
that sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1980 he has served 
12 years behind bars 
his case received wide public attention with the thin blue 
line a documentary on the case in which the prosecutions chief 
witness recanted 
defense attorney randy schaffer said he will seek adams release 
on bail and he predicted prosecutors would insist on a new trial 
not because they have any evidence he said but because of 
the politics 
the appeals court reviewed the case on the recommendation of 
state district judge larry baraka who said after a hearing in 
december that adams did not receive a fair trial 
the appeals court said adams rights were violated when the state 
knowingly suppressed evidence that a witness emily miller had 
failed to identify adams in a lineup that a police officer advised 
her she didnt identify adams and that the officer told her the 
person she should have identified 
the court also said ms miller committed perjury by testifying 
outside the presence of the jury that she had identified adams in 
the lineup 
in his opinion duncan wrote in the present case the trial 
court found the state was guilty of suppressing evidence favorable 
to the accused deceiving the trial court during applicants trial 
and knowingly using perjured testimony in each instance the nature 
of the evidence or testimony was such that beneficial results inured 
to the state at the expense of due process 
adams mother mildred adams of columbus ohio was overjoyed at 
the news 
we had planned on going down to tdc texas department of 
corrections over easter break to see him she told the dallas 
times herald now i just dont have the words to express myself 
were just as happy as can be up here 
adams case was resurrected with the help of new york filmmaker 
errol morris documentary the thin blue line which strongly 
suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecutions chief 
witness david harris 
im delighted morris said from los angeles i very much 
hope to be in texas when he is released 
on nov 28 1976 adams then 27 ran out of gas while driving 
home from work harris a vidor 16yearold who had stolen a car and 
driven to dallas helped adams get gas and spent the part of the day 
with him 
wood was shot and killed that night by a motorist he had pulled 
over on a traffic violation 
harris had testified that adams killed wood but harris recanted 
in the movie and during a hearing in december he is on death row 
for another slaying 
the texas board of pardons and parole on friday had denied parole 
for adams after a special review the board cited the violent nature 
of the crime and use of a weapon

sears 824 stores across the nation began reopening today after a 
42hour facelift to complete price reductions on 15 billion pieces 
of merchandise 
people are backed up as far as we can see its walltowall 
people said bob dumas manager of the sears roebuck and co 
store at the northland mall in columbus ohio 
we have christmasquantity people and we have better than 
christmas traffic said dumas who estimated more than 1000 
people waited outside for the doors to open 
workers changed prices tuesday on everything including light 
bulbs toasters and polished door knobs as sears prepared for a 
new retailing strategy it hopes will win customers 
employees also had to change signs and displays take inventory 
and clean up before the openings which occurred at noon local time 
the worst was the screwdrivers said chris skinner a high 
school freshman who spent much of the day at the northland mall 
store repricing baby booties and toddlers dresses you had to 
take them all down clean each one by hand then put them all backall 
otherwise it will 
use the strategy that retailers call everyday low pricing 
sears in adopting the strategy joins a growing list that 
includes k mart corp dayton hudson corps target discount chain 
and montgomery ward and co 
at the columbus store 700 workers scrambled to the tune of 
dont worry be happy as they marked down items such as twin 
canopy beds from 26999 to 9900 a diehard automobile battery 
from 72 to 64 and a craftsman power drill from 5999 to 3262 
sears new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its own 
brands and the 1000 other brand names it carries 
i dont think they had any choice they lost their customer 
base said karen sacks an analyst with standard and poors corp 
in new york i think wednesday will be a madhouse at sears but 
will they be able to reeducate their customers not to come in just 
for a sale 
monroe greenstein an analyst with the investment firm bear 
stearns in new york said the strategy paid off in wichita kan 
where sales rose 15 percent when sears tested the idea last fall 
and sears will invest in an advertising campaign that to not 
hear about it you would practically have to be comatose 
greenstein said 
the cash register rings about 3000 times a day in the 
100000squarefoot columbus store but the only sound in the last 
couple of days was the clicking of pricing guns and muffled sounds 
of store officials keeping in touch with walkietalkies 
about 100 high school students worked for 5 an hour to help 
company officials in shirtsleeves and scores of others with the 
makeover 
its the most exciting thing ive ever been involved in in 
sears said bob dumas manager of the northland mall store and a 
30year sears employee 
its no longer that old sea of yellow he said referring to 
sears old yellowwithblacklettering sale signs 
the new signs touting new lower prices are in vibrant red and 
blue in apparel the signs are magenta and gray 
they really needed to do something dramatic like that ms 
sacks said well just have to wait a year or two to see if it 
works

president bushs ethics commission agreed today 
there should be a uniform limit on the outside income earned by top 
government officials but called on congress to set the limit and let 
the president exempt some activities such as scholarly writing 
the eightmember panel completed its fifth and final working day 
still sharply divided over moonlighting by judges members of 
congress top executive branch officials and the most senior aides 
in all three branches 
their compromise recommendation was that congress limit outside 
earned income to a fixed percentage of an officials federal salary 
a majority of the group favored a figure closer to the 15 percent 
which nows governs the executive branch rather than the higher 
amounts allowed in congress and the judiciary 
and they asked that congress allow to the president to exempt 
from the limit income from categories of work that do not raise 
ethical issues or interfere with the full performance of official 
duties 
they tried but failed to agree on a list of exemptions former 
white house counsel lloyd cutler suggested listing teaching by 
judges among others but former attorney general griffin bell who 
wanted to exempt royalties objected to exempting teaching 
when you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching youre 
not a fulltime government worker bell said youre not in your 
office when youre teaching and you need to be there so other judges 
can talk to you 
with that compromise the panel completed work on the 
recommendations due to go to bush by march 9 the issue of 
moonlighting income was the most divisive it encountered in a review 
of all federal ethics laws and rules this issue had consumed more 
than an hour of debate on tuesday 
the panel was wrestling with questions such as how much money a 
federal judge should be allowed to make teaching at a law school 
and whether federal officials should be allowed to make more money 
writing novels or songs than from the government 
these questions about the proper limits of income earned outside 
government work have divided the commission more sharply than any 
others it has confronted in four daylong meetings 
the panel could not decide tuesday whether to recommend a ceiling 
on all outside earned income or whether certain activities should be 
exempt from any ceiling because they pose no conflict of interest 
at one point former white house counsel lloyd cutler argued 
suppose you write a popular song one night that doesnt belong to 
the government 
to which former attorney general griffin bell replied we dont 
want a government of songwriters 
last week the panel tentatively approved applying the executive 
branchs outsideincome limit 15 percent of the government salary 
with no exemptions to top officials of all three branches there 
is no limit now for judges the house limits members to 30 percent 
of salary and the senate to 40 percent 
cutler argued if the next ernest hemingway is deep in the 
internal revenue service all he can get out of it is 15 percent of 
a gs14 salary or hed have to quit 
judy bello general counsel to the us special trade 
representative replied that the ceiling would only apply to top 
officials at gs17 and above 
cutler however found other examples suppose you work for the 
defense department on the mx missile and you develop an idea for 
hybrid corn one night thats worth 1 million youve got to give 
it away 
i will dissent from a cap unless there are some totally 
excepted categories of earned income such as writing a popular 
song he said 
cutler said he had been called by a federal judge whose teaching 
and legal writings bring him income greater than 15 percent of his 
federal salary he said the judge said he would quit the bench if 
the cap were enacted by congress 
a judge teaching at an accredited law school is a fine activity 
and there is not the shadow of the possibility of a conflict 
cutler said 
bell who is a former appellate judge responded if you want 
to be a judge you ought to be a fulltime judge 
bell also said exemptions would send the message that we dont 
think its unethical not to give your fulltime effort to your 
government job 
bello also backed the ceiling i wouldnt want to drive a good 
judge off the bench but i oppose watering down the current 
law 
these activities do take time from your work she added 
and public confidence can be undermined if public servants are 
taking time from work 
the panels chairman malcolm r wilkey a former appellate 
judge advocated the exemptions particularly for judges to teach 
law this interplay between a live judge and a law school is very 
vital to our society 
if there are no exemptions wilkey said well lose the 
brightest minds people whove got the extra energy to do more 
work theyre the big contributors to our society and well lose 
them from government 
fred fielding who was white house counsel for president reagan 
said the panel seemed to be ignoring other kinds of outside earned 
income such as breeding race horses or rosegrowing seeing no 
reason to discriminate in favor of some outside activities over 
others fielding said he leaned toward a cap

the bush administration missed two more 
congressional deadlines wednesday for staking out positions on major 
defense issues saying it wasnt ready to produce reports dealing 
with star wars and the b2 stealth bomber 
col miguel monteverde a pentagon spokesman said acting defense 
secretary william h taft iv was notifying congress that the march 1 
deadline for the star wars report would be missed because the future 
of the antimissile defense system is being addressed in a much 
broader white house strategic policy review 
the air force in a brief statement said the report on the b2 
would not go forward wednesday because it was still in 
coordination 
an air force official who asked not to be named said however 
that that report also was being delayed until the national security 
review was completed 
president bush in his budget address to congress announced last 
month he had ordered the broad policy review and said he expected it 
to be completed within 90 days 
on feb 15 the white house cited the same review as the reason 
it would not meet a deadline for choosing between two mobile nuclear 
missiles the singlewarhead midgetman or a railcar version of the 
10warhead mx 
the missed deadlines come at the same time bush has been unable 
to win senate confirmation of his choice as defense secretary 
former sen john tower of texas 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater and other administration 
officials have insisted that towers troubles are not responsible 
for the failure to meet the congressional deadlines 
rather they assert that those deadlines were set much too early 
for a new administration and that bush wants to take the time to 
review the nations entire strategic posture 
other officials at the pentagon however say little in the way 
of policy formation is being accomplished at the defense department 
because of the lack of leadership those officials holdovers from 
the reagan administration spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the first report that had been due wednesday dealt with one 
deployment option for a star wars system the socalled alps or 
accidental launch protection system 
first suggested by sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the 
senate armed services committee alps would entail the construction 
of a small missiledefense system capable of stopping a missile 
fired by accident or by a terrorist group 
the second report due wednesday involved the air forces b2 a 
new bomber that is supposed to be almost invisible to radar the 
first of the bombers was unveiled in november but has not yet flown 
the air force wants to build 132 of the planes but estimated in 
december that counting research and development costs the bombers 
would cost more than 500 million each even if research and 
development expenses are discounted each plane will cost 305 
million to build 
faced with that kind of expense congress said it wanted a report 
by march 1 setting forth the total program cost in constant and 
in current dollars of the advanced technology b2 bomber program

sanders often billed as the nations only socialist mayor 
announced last fall that he would not seek a fifth term in city 
elections march 7 he said he wants other progressives to move up 
the electoral ladder in part to dispel the notion that the movement 
is a oneman band he plans to teach and write 
sanders 47 was elected by 10 votes in 1981 over a 10year mayor 
gordon paquette and a democratic machine widely seen as having 
atrophied he promptly put his longtime leftist activism to work 
building a political power base of his own in the progressive 
coalition 
he was reelected three times by more comfortable margins 
winning in 1987 with 6901 votes to 5594 votes and even his 
critics with a mixture of bemusement and grudging admiration give 
him credit for reinvigorating city politics 
he brought a breath of fresh air to city hall said patrick 
robins owner of an office supply company and longtime democratic 
regular 
us news and world report not a publication known for radical 
politics picked sanders in 1987 as one of the nations 20 best 
mayors meanwhile burlington a city of 38000 and the closest 
thing vermont has to a metropolitan area has prospered and been 
ranked high in national qualityoflife surveys 
love him or hate him robins said bernie sanders will be a 
tough act to follow 
a month ago it looked as though burlingtons progressive era 
might end with sanders departure the coalition picked as his 
wouldbe successor peter clavelle a city administrator with no 
experience running for office and without the rhetorical flair and 
propensity for bashing american corporate capitalism that has given 
sanders a national reputation 
clavelle 39 faces tough opposition from democrat nancy chioffi 
46 president of the board of aldermen and owner of a downtown 
clothing and souvenir store she has not only the democratic 
nomination but support from republicans the gop didnt even field 
a candidate 
attacking clavelle from the left is 48yearold lawyer sandra 
baird whose fledgling vermont greens party advocates a moratorium 
on development for profit she denounces sanders and clavelle 
saying theyve sold out to business interests 
initially many political observers thought clavelle was in 
trouble facing a single candidate backed by democrats and 
republicans and likely to lose some of the hardcore left to baird 
he also was criticized as bland a mumbler unable to articulate 
strong beliefs 
but clavelle appears to have turned things around picking up 
several key labor endorsements solidifying support among peace 
activists and jesse jackson democrats 
clavelle who helped develop several programs for women as chief 
of the citys community economic development office even picked up 
an endorsement over his two female opponents from the local chapter 
of the national organization for women that was seen as a coup in a 
university town with a strong feminist community 
theyre going to win its that simple university of vermont 
political scientist garrison nelson said of clavelle and the 
progressives 
nelsons view was supported by a poll published sunday in the 
burlington free press which showed clavelle with 40 percent of 
likely voters supporting him 31 percent for chioffi 6 percent for 
baird and 2 percent for michael hackett an independent candidate 
running on what he calls the tax revolt ticket 
the telephone poll of 342 likely voters found 21 percent 
undecided or refusing to answer it had a margin of error of 65 
percent those two factors appeared to leave open the possibility 
that chioffi still could win the race 
chioffi has emphasized her experience as a small business owner 
and her belief that men and women and rich and poor are equal by 
virtue of opportunity 
clavelle talks about helping the little guy about helping 
single mothers and povertystricken women she told the free 
press i dont see anybody as being a little guy working people 
are not little 
but that pitch of equality of opportunity has not resonated much 
in a city schooled on eight years of sanders speeches about class 
struggle 
clavelle says he will maintain the ideals of the citys 
progressives he angered some of them when in his first batch of 
campaign literature he described himself as an independent 
rather than as a progressive and he does not embrace the socialist 
label as sanders does 
but he says he wants to look out for the elderly the poor and 
the little guy 
im no bernie sanders clavelle said our backgrounds are 
different our styles are different but our political visions are 
the same

the senate voted 990 today to confirm james d 
watkins as energy secretary handing the retired admiral the 
daunting challenge of refurbishing the energy departments 
crippled network of nuclear weapons factories 
the vote came less than four hours after the senate energy and 
natural resources committee voted 190 to recommend that watkins 
61 be made the first career military man to head the department 
since it was created in 1977 
j bennett johnston dla chairman of the committee told the 
senate that the job of reviving and cleaning up the nuclear weapons 
complex was a top priority 
it is perhaps the most daunting challenge that we have ever 
given to anybody in the cabinet anytime in the history of this 
country johnston said 
johnston called watkins a man of that substance and that 
reputation echoing the warm praise watkins won during his 
confirmation hearing last wednesday 
although he has no experience in the conventional energy field 
watkins developed an expertise in nuclear power during a 41year 
navy career that included training in reactor technology as well as 
the command of a nuclear submarine 
now hes about to enter battle against one of the bush 
administrations biggest challenges revitalizing the energy 
departments nuclear weapons complex and planning a longrange 
cleanup operation that may cost 100 billion 
the energy department spends about twothirds of its budget 
which this year is 14 billion on developing building and testing 
nuclear weapons for the pentagon the remaining onethird is spent 
on conventional energy projects mainly research 
key parts of the 12state weapons complex are shut down because 
of safety technical and managerial concerns leaving the united 
states without the capacity to build nuclear weapons for the first 
time since the dawn of the nuclear age 
its the most daunting management task i think weve ever given 
to anybody ive seen in government sen j bennett johnston 
dla said during watkins feb 22 hearing 
sen james a mcclure ridaho said that although the weapons 
plant problems were created by past administrations you admiral 
watkins will be the man in the limelight or hotseat charged with 
getting the situation effectively under control as quickly as 
possible 
watkins told his confirmation hearing the energy departments 
weapons complex was antique outofdate desperately in need of 
change he also ripped the departments management structure 
calling it a mess and vowing to install the core of a new 
management team to oversee the plants within six months 
watkins is a 1949 graduate of the naval academy at annapolis 
md and was handpicked by the late admiral hyman g rickover 
father of the modern nuclear navy he served as a submarine 
commander cruiser and destroyer force commander of the seventh 
fleet and nato commander of the sixth fleet before capping his 
career as chief of naval operations the services top position he 
retired in 1986 
the fourstar admiral is not shy about stressing his relationship 
with rickover 
i learned from him that the fulfillment of the mission of our 
national defense and the protection of the environment were mutually 
compatible objectives watkins told his confirmation hearing 
he said one of his top priorities as energy secretary would be to 
cultivate in department managers a commitment to safe operations of 
the nuclear complex 
all that fancy technology is useless and perhaps even a threat 
to society unless we properly educate and train those entrusted 
with its operation he said

gov mario cuomo signed a new agreement to 
buy the 54 billion shoreham nuclear plant for 1 and dismantle it 
and a key lawmaker today said he likes the deal 
under the agreement the long island lighting co will let the 
state tear down the neverused plant which has had to wage 
licensing battles since its completion in 1985 and nearly bankrupted 
the utility with cost overruns and delays 
it is time to end this matter once and for all and turn our 
energies to new productive measures for long island and the 
state cuomo said tuesday 
unlike a similar agreement last year which was killed by state 
legislators cuomo predicted this deal would succeed because it 
largely bypasses the legislature 
state senate majority leader ralph marino a long island 
republican whose support for the plan is crucial to its success 
said today that he likes the deal shoreham is on long island 55 
miles from manhattan 
i think we should get the issue behind us at least have some 
kind of direction and this gives us stability marino said 
other reaction was mixed 
long island business leaders contend the 25 billion loss that 
lilco plans to take on the plant during the next three years will be 
passed to its customers who already pay among the nations highest 
electric bills 
jack kulka of the association for a better long island said his 
business group was very very skeptical because shoreham 
continues to rise from the dead 
but suffolk county executive patrick halpin whose county is 
where the plant is located said i am pleased that long islands 
longestrunning soap opera has finally gotten its cancellation 
notice 
in december the state legislature refused to act on a deal 
negotiated in june by cuomo with the utility that would also have 
had the state buy the plant for 1 and dismantle it in that deal 
lilco would have been guaranteed 5 percent rate increases for at 
least three years and possibly for a decade 
at the time key lawmakers said the deal was too expensive for 
lilco customers cuomo said the legislators were simply afraid to 
face a politically tough situation 
under tuesdays agreement lilco is guaranteed no particular 
rates which are decided by the state public service commission 
cuomo predicted the rates would be lower than proposed in the 
earlier deal probably less than 45 percent 
nobody is going to be responsible for the rates quipped 
cuomo its wonderful 
last week however the commission approved a temporary 54 
percent rate increase for the utility 
cuomo said he made the new deal because he believed the federal 
nuclear regulatory commission was about to grant lilco a license to 
operate the plant at 25 percent of full power 
the nrc last week announced a proposed rule change aimed at 
revitalizing the nations nuclear power industry by cutting down the 
licensing process for plants to six years or less compared with the 
recent average of 13 years 
many utilities swamped by debt from nuclear plant construction 
contend that long delays in obtaining an nrc license are a main 
reason why no new plants have been ordered since the mid1970s 
the 800megawatt shoreham plant which was proposed in 1966 has 
thus far been unable to win anything more than a 5 percent testing 
license from federal officials thats largely due to the refusal of 
cuomo and long island officials to cooperate in emergency planning 
for the plant 
cuomo and the officials long have argued that shoreham should 
never be allowed to open because the area around the plant couldnt 
be safely evacuated during a nuclear emergency lilco disputed that 
tuesdays agreement is subject to approval by lilcos board of 
directors and shareholders a process that utility spokesman jim 
lois said would take approximately three months 
while the approvals for this agreement are being obtained the 
company will continue to vigorously pursue a full power operating 
license for shoreham before the nuclear regulatory commission 
said a lilco statement 
however it said it would operate the plant only if shareholders 
veto the agreement which also requires approval by the public 
service commission the state power authority and the long island 
power authority 
assemblyman paul harenberg of suffolk called the new agreement 
very unfortunate and said cuomo is forcing the public to pay 
for the foolishness and imprudence of the investors of lilco

the senate today voted 981 in favor of the 
nomination of dr louis sullivan as health and human services 
secretary saying he will be a caring advocate for millions of 
poor americans 
the sole dissenting vote was cast by sen jesse helms rnc 
who said he was disturbed that sullivan has declined to take a final 
position on several abortionrelated issues including whether the 
federal government should back medical research using tissue from 
aborted fetuses 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas praised the atlanta doctors 
commitment to providing health care for the needy and said his 
policies at hhs will define president bushs call for a kinder 
gentler america sullivan will be the only black in bushs cabinet 
i am confident dr sullivan is going to be a caring advocate 
for these millions of americans bentsen said as republicans and 
democrats alike praised the nomination 
helms said that as a matter of conscience he could not vote 
for sullivan based on his failure or refusal to take a position on 
a number of extremely important issues all of which were related 
to abortion 
helms said that because he supports the views of the 
antiabortion community which opposes research using aborted fetal 
tissue i cannot turn my back on that opinion 
sullivan won 190 approval in the senate finance committee last 
week and no opposition surfaced monday at a courtesy hearing before 
the senate labor and human resources committee which did not vote 
separately on the nomination 
as the 55yearold blood specialist and medical school founder 
moved toward confirmation the senate voted 990 to approve retired 
adm james d watkins as energy secretary the action came a few 
hours after the energy and natural resources committee endorsed 
watkins nomination 190 
meanwhile in other action on capitol hill involving bush 
appointees 
william bennett the former education secretary who has been 
named to the new post of chief drug enforcement executive was 
appearing before the senate judiciary committee chairman joseph 
biden ddel struggled eight years to create the position 
edward j derwinski the former illinois congressman and 
undersecretary of state was appearing for the second straight time 
before the veterans affairs committee on his nomination to head the 
new veterans affairs department 
most senators on the two committees before which sullivan 
testified were highly complimentary of sullivan who founded the 
morehouse school of medicine in atlanta and will step down as its 
president to take the hhs job 
few displayed much interest in sullivans views on abortion an 
issue that has caused controversy for the nominee since his remarks 
in the atlanta journal constitution that he favored abortion rights 
and to sen bob packwood rore that he supported the supreme 
court decision that legalized abortion 
abortion opponents pounced on the statements and demanded 
assurances from the bush administration that sullivans hhs policies 
would conform to the views of the president when it came to abortion 
at his confirmation hearing before the finance committee 
sullivan apologized to packwood the ranking republican on the 
panel for having misspoken his position on abortion 
at each hearing he repeated that he shares president bushs views 
on the issue he opposes abortion except in cases of rape incest or 
danger to the mothers life he also said that like bush he 
opposes federal funding for abortions except when the mothers life 
is threatened and would welcome a supreme court decision overturning 
its 1973 roe vs wade decision 
sullivan however declined to take a final position on whether 
the federal government should back medical research using tissue 
from aborted fetuses he said he would not do anything to 
encourage abortion in order to get fetal tissue but he said he 
wanted to review an advisory committees recommendations before 
stating a further position on the issue 
sen william armstrong rcolo an abortion foe accused him of 
ducking the question and voted present on his nomination in 
committee 
sullivan a personal friend of the bushes is set to take the 
reins of the largest department in the federal bureaucracy 
controlling a budget of nearly 400 billion and managing 114000 
employees 
hhs which administers a third of all federal spending includes 
medicare medicaid social security the food and drug 
administration and the us public health service 
sullivan was to be sworn in immediately after his confirmation 
although a formal ceremony is scheduled for march 10

radar has pinpointed an object believed to be the 
cargo door that tore from a united airlines jumbo jet but federal 
investigators say they arent sure whether it can be retrieved from 
under 16800 feet of water 
the national transportation safety board said late tuesday that 
navy radar tracked a large object 85 miles southwest of honolulu 
about 45 seconds after the pilot of flight 811 reported an inflight 
emergency 
nine passengers were swept to their deaths when a 10by20 foot 
section of the fuselage including the cargo door tore from the 
right side of the boeing 747 at 22000 feet on friday twentyseven 
others were treated for injuries 
the radar picked up something that could be a large piece of 
metal possibly the cargo door ntsb investigator lee dickinson 
said tuesday night 
that information is going back to washington dc to see if 
we can indeed determine that was the cargo door and its exact 
location 
dickinson said the door would be very helpful to us in our 
analysis but added that he did not know whether the object could 
be salvaged and the decision to try would be up to the full 
fivemember ntsb board 
we have the location at the surface of the water he said 
youre talking about three miles down one can only guess where 
that is 
paul wolcott a technician and research submarine pilot at the 
hawaii undersea research lab at the university of hawaii today said 
the navy is about the only agency with equipment capable of 
recovering the door 
such a search would probably involve use of an underwater sonar 
sled and a remotecontrolled vehicle equipped with a camera he 
said the vehicle could probably hook a line to the door so it could 
be lifted to the surface he said the least likely possibility 
because of the tremendous expense up to 40000 a day would be 
the navys sea cliff one of the worlds few manned research 
submarines capable of reaching that depth wolcott said 
dickinson said the ntsbs field work was nearly completed and 
investigators would leave hawaii today and tomorrow 
earlier tuesday investigators reported that the same front right 
cargo door had had a recent history of problems including a seal 
that was repaired in january 
investigators had not yet determined whether the recent repairs 
were connected to the accident said ntsb spokeswoman drucella 
anderson 
we just dont know that right now she said 
united airlines spokesman rob doughty said the faulty door seal 
had to be fixed before the plane could fly again and other 
electrical problems did not affect the planes airworthiness 
on dec 5 the doors electrical doorclosing mechanism worked 
intermittently doughty said it was repaired but failed again on 
dec 13 and dec 22 he said it was fixed in chicago on dec 23 and 
no further trouble was reported he said 
i might add though that it is completely proper to close this 
door manually and thats what was done he said 
doughty said he did not know the details of the work on the 
doors seal but i dont think it was major 
meanwhile tuesday united officials said a safety pin had to be 
replaced in a rear cargo door of a boeing 747 that was to fly from 
sydney australia the repair delayed the arrival in honolulu by 18 
hours 
many passengers however said they did not mind the delay 
including allen hochberg of new york 
how can you get aggravated at them for trying to save us he 
asked

cia director william webster said wednesday 
libyan strongman moammar gadhafis chemical weapons plant is so big 
that he could easily share its output with other radical nations 
the production capability is far more than col gadhafi could 
ever need or use by any stretch of the imagination webster told 
the senate foreign relations committee 
is this going to become just another form of currency a 
brokering capability he asked 
webster also said libya could have the capacity of targeting such 
countries as israel with chemical weapons if gadhafis forces obtain 
airtoair refueling capacity for their bombers 
it moves it the chemical weapons threat off the battlefields 
and puts it into the cities and strategic areas of the whole 
middle east he said 
webster was asked by sen jesse helms rnc if elements of the 
west german armed forces had aided libyan efforts to obtain 
airtoair refueling capability 
webster said he would prefer to discuss the matter in a closed 
nonpublic session but told helms youre right on target 
webster later declined to elaborate on his comment 
gadhafi has said the plant was built to produce pharmaceuticals 
not chemical weapons webster said that even if that were true the 
facility could be converted to manufacture weapons within a days 
time 
the cia director did say as he and other us officials have 
said before that west german corporations as well as those from 
other european and asian countries have helped libya acquire a 
chemical weapons production capability and that it would have 
been virtually impossible for libya to do that without such help 
but he said the west german government after a period of 
hesitation has become more willing to address the situation and is 
moving to tighten export controls on the chemicals and technologies 
needed to produce chemical weapons 
webster said that while there was an initial slowness on the 
part of some countries to accept available intelligence information 
that a problem of chemical weapons proliferation existed that is no 
longer true

here are excerpts from the majority and 
minority reports of the national economic commission which were 
submitted to president bush and congressional leaders wednesday

as the united states approaches the 1990s and with the economy 
continuing to expand dynamically economic policy shaped to some 
extent by the federal reserve should be designed not only to 
sustain economic growth in the near term but to help create the 
national wealth that will be the basis for future growth 
budget deficits are a direct drain on the national savings pool 
to enable investment to grow rapidly either private savings must 
increase or the necessary capital must be borrowed from abroad 
nonetheless the decade of the 1980s has been characterized by 
high savings and low spending in most industrial countries 
contrasted with low savings and high spending in the united states 
including that by the federal government such imbalances cannot be 
sustained indefinitely 
one result of these spendingsavings imbalances has been 
historically large trade deficits in the united states and 
correspondingly large trade surpluses in a number of other 
countries large trade deficits like budget deficits drain 
domestic savings as more and more of the income produced in the 
united states flows abroad one factor causing trade deficits is 
that american consumers like to buy foreign goods including capital 
equipment american manufacturers should become more competitive and 
regain the favor of the us marketplace 
another objective is to increase investment relative to 
consumption in the economy one of the best ways to accomplish this 
is to adopt the recommendation that the capital gains tax be sharply 
cut 
recent data suggests that the industrialized countries are 
becoming more capital intensive the country that is the farthest 
along in this process japan has a rate of productivity growth that 
is almost twice that of the united states with real income growth 
also twice as high 
americans must significantly increase savings that in turn will 
be used to finance capital investment clearly one task is to 
reduce the budget deficits and factors that result in the federal 
government being a drain on the national saving pool and to do so 
without raising taxes this should reduce the real cost of capital 
and stimulate even more investment demand 
the next step is to set a course for creating government 
surpluses or at least inhibiting future government deficits while at 
the same time not inhibiting economic growth this will be a long 
term process 
whatever the benefits of deficit reduction the nation must not 
expect that a balanced budget or even government surpluses will 
solve all our economic problems 
comparing the economic performance of the key industrial 
countries over the past 15 years does not suggest that countries 
with the lowest budget deficits are those that necessarily grow the 
fastest have the lowest inflation have the highest savings rates 
have the lowest real interest rates or the lowest trade deficits 
there are many other factors besides balanced budgets that could 
contribute to economic growth rapidly changing technology and 
products newly productive economic centers and increasingly 
integrated world markets suggest that an economic policy driven by a 
single goal is not appropriate 
economic policy should not only address the traditional concerns 
about capital investment and productivity in the industrial sector 
but also such hardtomeasure items as productivity in service 
industries and educated labor forces 
the budget should and will be balanced over time indeed the 
administrations budget lays out one workable plan for eliminating 
the deficit 
there are other alternatives reflecting different priorities but 
with equal or greater spending restraint that could balance the 
budget by fiscal 1993 as required by grammrudmanhollings grh 
without raising taxes 
the national economic commission has been working on this project 
for approximately 11 months we have heard from 85 witnesses and 
read over 1300 responses from private citizens and groups our 
mandate was to recommend ways to eliminate the budget deficit while 
not impeding economic growth 
it is clear that the president would prefer to coordinate this 
activity with congress on a onetoone basis indeed this is the 
manner in which this process should proceed 
we should continue to reduce the deficit as a percentage of gnp 
we support the position that the deficit can be resolved through 
restraints on the growth of federal spending without increasing 
taxes or affecting low income meanstested benefits therefore we 
recommend restraining spending increases while keeping growth strong 
as the mainstay of budget policy 
with an estimated 82 billion in additional revenues in fiscal 
year 1990 it is clear that we do not have to and should not raise 
taxes but rather should restrain the rate of growth in federal 
spending 
the grammrudmanhollings deficit targets represent arbitrary but 
appropriate goals for budget policy over the next several years 
these goals if realized will be attained without any new tax 
measures and should result in a federal deficit that continues to 
decline significantly and consistently 
we believe budget process reform should be an integral part of 
any deficit reduction plan any agreement on the budget should be 
accompanied by process reform to rebuild public confidence in 
national fiscal and monetary policy

the national economic commission was given the responsibility for 
making specific bipartisan recommendations regarding 
methods to reduce the federal budget deficit while promoting 
economic growth and encouraging saving and capital formation and 
a means of ensuring that the burden of achieving 
deficitreduction goals does not undermine economic growth and is 
not borne disproportionately by any one economic group social 
group region or state 
deficit reduction is a relatively shortterm objective in that 
the goal is to achieve a balanced budget within five years 
promoting economic growth implies a perspective that extends into 
the 21st century 
the realities of the political constraints faced by the 
commission during the presidential election and transition period 
left no serious possibility of carrying out the first responsibility 
on a bipartisan basis 
the democratic members of the commission concluded reluctantly 
and sadly that the republican members understandable desire to 
support the new presidents plan for achieving deficit reduction 
precluded any likelihood of bipartisan agreement 
the constraints he imposed and his flexible freeze plan are 
plainly and simply inconsistent with ensuring that the burden of 
deficit reduction does not fall disproportionately on any one 
economic group social group region or state 
the fact remains however that the majority of commissioners 
believe that our national savings rate is too low and that 
continuing large budget deficits and huge seemingly intractable 
trade deficits threaten the nations longterm prospects for strong 
economic growth the views in part ii of our report are directed 
toward these longerrun concerns 
what is at stake is how we as a nation enter the 21st century we 
can either slouch into the next century or we can march into it all 
flags flying our future posture will depend upon whether in 
hamiltons term we get our political arithmetic in order in the 
next five years 
getting our political arithmetic in order means achieving budget 
balance by fiscal year 1993 anything earlier being wishful 
thinking and moving into surpluses thereafter the surplus goals 
are readily identifiable they should be approximately equal to the 
combined surplus of the social security trust funds 
there is no option in the sense of an alternative use for the 
surpluses the revenue stream to finance the surplus already exists 
in the form of payroll taxes that are high enough to put the social 
security system on a partially funded basis 
if the present practice of using these surpluses to pay for 
current consumption continues the pressure to return to a 
payasyougo basis will become irresistible and the payroll 
taxes will be returned to a payasyougo level 
on the other hand if we can summon the political will to save 
the surplus we will transform our economy and secure our future 
beyond any present expectations

father the former president and unleashes a number of gossipy 
barbs in her new book first father first daughter 
she writes that former deputy chief of staff michael deaver

ronald reagans conservative movement but because reagan was a 
politcal train that happened to be leaving the station and mike 
deaver wanted to be on board usa today reported wednesday 
her opinion of former white house chief of staff donald regan is 
no higher he seemed to suffer from that rare snobbery of the 
greedy rich 
she said regan had his office remodeled to include an outdoor 
patio like the presidents and kept referring to him as cousin 
until reagan joked he would be accused of nepotism if regan didnt 
knock it off 
the official publication date of first father first daughter 
is april 3 but copies of the book will be in some stores near the 
end of next week jennifer kittredge a spokeswoman for the

the right wing scored a decisive victory in 
israels municipal elections and prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
wednesday the voters had vindicated his refusal to deal with the plo 
the elections tuesday extended the power of his likud bloc on the 
local level and gave major gains to jewish and moslem 
fundamentalists 
teddy kollek the moderate labor partys bestknown mayor won a 
sixth term in jerusalem but lost control of the city council 
a preliminary count gave religious parties 12 of the 31 council 
seats up from 10 in 1983 kolleks one jerusalem slate got 11 or 12 
seats down from 17 four went to likud and three or four to the 
secular citizens rights movement 
more seats on the council will give religious parties greater 
power to enforce demands that restaurants and theaters close on the 
jewish sabbath but kollek said he wont make concessions that do 
not conform to the will of the majority 
at stake in tuesdays elections were 147 mayors offices and city 
councils labor won 54 in 1983 likud 26 and the rest went to local 
or religious parties 
final results are not expected until later in the week but labor 
estimates it lost control of at least 10 towns councils including 
several in traditional strongholds most were taken by likud 
including five of the largest cities 
likud has been a major national force for 12 years but labor has 
been perceived as the establishment party because it controls such 
grassroots organizations as the trade union federation 
shimon peres the labor party leader said on army radio 
wednesday we have definitely been dealt a blow and i dont want 
to underestimate its force but five years ago when we won a big 
victory in municipal elections it didnt mean anything for the 
knesset parliament elections 
shamir said the likud bloc a small opposition faction for nearly 
three decades until it upset labor in the 1977 national elections 
is turning into a central party that holds the power 
he said in a tv interview the voters had declared their support 
for his refusal to negotiate with the palestine libration 
organization or accept palestinian demands for statehood 
the results certainly strengthen me and the headlines of the 
israeli papers have already reached the world media and the united 
states and nobody can tell me i speak in the name of a small part 
of the israeli public he said they know i speak in the name of 
the majority of the israeli public 
shamir is scheduled to visit washington in april 
yitzhak galnoor a political scientist at hebrew university in 
jerusalem said shamirs linkage of the palestinian issue to local 
politics was part of a strategy agaist mounting pressure to deal 
with the plo in a recent poll 54 percent of the israelis 
responding favored negotiations 
in tel aviv mayor shlomo lahat of likud won a fourth term on a 
prosecular platform and in haifa which has been a labor 
stronghold labor incumbent arieh gurel clung won narrowly 
voters in akko a mixed jewisharab city that has become a symbol 
of coexistence rejected deputy mayor david barlev of likud who 
said all arab residents should be expelled 
moslem fundamentalists entered arab elections for the first time 
scoring dramatic victories over leftwing parties about 400000 of 
israels more than 750000 arab citizens were eligible to vote 
the islamic movement swept umm el fahem the secondlargest arab 
city green islamic flags flew over the city wednesday and residents 
drove through town in their cars creating a huge traffic jam ap 
photographer max nash reported 
some jewish leaders expressed concern about the victory by moslem 
fundamentalists whose advocacy of one large islamic state in the 
region challenges israels right to exist 
arab analysts said the islamic movement won support by building 
schools and clinics its not a matter of religion its a matter 
of services said lufty mashour editor of the arabiclanguage 
newspaper sinara in nazareth 
noting the rise of jewish fundamentalism he said if they are 
worried about the moslems they should by worried about the 
ultraorthodox the moslems are less dangerous than the 
ultraorthodox

a woman whose 6yearold son needs a bone 
marrow transplant said wednesday she is glad the state will pay for 
the operation but bitter about how the state handled the case 
its a big relief im just sorry my family had to go through 
this no family should have to go through that vargas said in an 
interview in her apartment as her son derek annese fidgeted on the 
couch beside her 
after the boston sunday globe quoted new hampshire officials as 
saying the state would not cover most costs associated with the 
operation dereks plight became the subject of radio talk shows and 
led to a public campaign to raise money for the operation expected 
to cost about 150000 
on tuesday gov judd gregg held a news conference to assure that 
medicaid would cover most of the cost 
derek who lives with his mother and two brothers on about 800 a 
month in public assistance needs the transplant to give him a 
chance to beat a precursor of leukemia a bonemarrow donor has been 
located and doctors at the university of wisconsin are scheduling 
the transplant vargas said 
the boys mother said wednesday she has not heard from state 
officials learning the news from a radio newscast when she and 
derek returned to new hampshire on tuesday from a trip to disney 
world the trip was courtesy of the makeawish program for gravely 
ill children 
gregg said at the news conference that the newspaper account was 
incorrect resulting from a communications breakdown and that 
the states decision to pay for the transplant is not a new 
policy 
however globe reporter bob hohler stood by his story and was 
supported by dereks lawyer and doctors 
i dont see how it could be a misunderstanding vargas said 
they state officials told wisconsin no they told my 
pediatrician no and they told my doctor in boston at the 
danafarber cancer institute no 
they werent going to pay for anything to do with the 
transplant she said 
derek made it clear he was tired of answering reporters 
questions but said he felt great 
vargas said derek was excited that a path was now clear for the 
operation but she said he may only now be learning of the gravity 
of his illness 
after derek left the room vargas said it was only tuesday night 
as the family watched news programs that had been videotaped for 
them during their absence that the boy heard one of his doctors say 
he would die without the operation 
and me and my sister both just looked right at him at the same 
time because it was the first time that it was loud and clear and 
we just didnt know what he was going to do she said 
but he just sat in the chair quietly and watched the rest of 
the newscast and he asked me if all those people were helping 
him and i said yes

called the great seal steal 
before nebraska became a state on march 1 1867 omaha was the

when the new capitol was ready for occupancy on dec 1 1868 
according to previously published reports thensecretary of state 
tom kennard declared well have to steal the seal there is no 
other way

he entered the territorial capitol wrapped up the seal and stashed 
it under the seat of his buggy 
he whipped his horses into action and by nightfall had crossed 
the platte river the line of demarcation between forces pushing 
omaha or lincoln as the state capital 
early the next morning he appeared on the steps of the new 
capitol there on dec 3 1868 he put the impression of the 
insignia from the state seal to a proclamation declaring the capital 
of nebraska as lincoln county of lancaster nebraska and that it 
was open for business 
for 121 years that same seal has been used almost daily for 
hundreds of official governmental transactions the seal depicts a 
steamboat ascending the missouri river a smith with hammer and

john tower made an extraordinary public 
confession of marital infidelity today but vowed to keep fighting to 
win confirmation as defense secretary by invoking the words of the 
commander at the alamo i shall never surrender or retreat 
in an appearance at the national press club tower also said he 
regards his weekend oath to quit drinking if he wins confirmation as 
sacredand i can assure you i will abide by it 
tower fielded questions about his confirmation ordeal as vice 
president dan quayle conceded the bush admininistration is currently 
short of the votes needed to ratify the appointment and as senate 
majority leader george mitchell announced his opposition 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
bush was continuing to lobby senators personally in search of 
additional votes 
asked whether he had ever broken his wedding vows tower twice 
divorced and now single said as a matter of fact i have broken 
wedding vows i think i am probably not alone in that connection 
towers second wife lilla alleged marital misconduct in 
court filings in the couples divorce case 
towers appearance marked the latest turn in the struggle by the 
bush administration as well as the former texas senator to 
salvage the nomination against solid democratic opposition in the 
senate 
tower has been struggling against concerns about his drinking 
habits allegations of womanizing and questions over possible 
conflicts of interest stemming from his employment as a defense 
industry consultant 
in his remarks tower also turned aside a question of whether his 
appointment was a political payoff for having headed a commission 
that gave bush a clean bill of health in the irancontra scandal of 
the reagan administration he said congressional investigators also 
found nothing to implicate bush and said i wonder what kind of 
payoff theyre going to get 
tower showed flashes of humor and grit by turn at the press club 
rostrum 
asked how he felt about his predicament he said a little bit 
like the fellow who was immersed in tar and feathers and was being 
ridden out of town on a rail he said really gentlemen if it were 
not for the honor id rather hitchhike 
asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn from 
nomination he replied by quoting from the last letter written by 
lt col william barrett travis whom he identified as the leader of 
the texans who fought and died at the alamo i shall never 
surrender or retreat 
tower paused briefly and said i am a little sorry i brought up 
the alamo analogy it just occurred to me what happened at the alamo 
just 10 days after travis wrote that letter texas defenders were 
wiped out by mexican gen santa annas forces 
asked what had angered him most about his confirmation fight he 
said there were no clearly defined standards against which he was 
being judged he noted that several senators have said that the 
secretary of defense as the commander of us military forces 
behind only the president must adhere to a higher standard i 
accept thatbut my question is how much he said 
he then asked whether it is acceptable for members late in the 
evening who had a few drinks in hideawaysto come onto the floor 
late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear 
deterrence or to accept speaking fees campaign contributions and 
paid vacations from special interests who have a vested interest 
in the legislative process 
there was no letup in the political storm surrounding the 
nomination as fitzwater charged democrats with turning the 
appointment into a partisan struggle 
the spokesman claimed some senators are starting to have second 
thoughts about the words they used to describe tower 
quayle claimed progress for the administration lobbying campaign 
as well 
we dont have 50 votes yet but were moving in that direction 
and ill be the 51st he said referring to his ability to cast a 
tiebreaking vote in the senate where the democrats hold a 5545 
advantage 
key republicans said they would meet later in the day to decide 
whether to seek a delay in the beginning of the debate on the 
nomination which has drawn widespread opposition from democrats 
tower has been battling questions about his drinking habits 
allegations of womanizing and concerns about his acceptance of 
thousands of dollars in defense consultants fees and mitchell 
addressed those issues in his speech ion the senate 
the maine democrat said he was troubled by towers work as a 
defense consultant he received payment while it was widely 
assumed that he might be a nominee for defense secretary if 
president bush were elected the democratic leader said 
turning to the controversy over towers personal conduct 
mitchell said it is not moral perfection or the qualifications of 
senators that are at issue here 
public officials have a right to a private life he said 
they do not have a right to engage publicly in behavior which 
could interfere with the discharge of their public duties 
a single lapse in judgment or perhaps even a few should not 
disqualify an individual from public service mitchell continued 
but when the lapses in judgment form a pattern of many 
incidents spanning many years and when there is insufficient 
evidence to demonstrate that the pattern has been broken then there 
are reasonable grounds to question whether the individual possesses 
the qualities necessary for the uniquely demanding job of the 
secretary of defense 
mitchells position was widely anticipated particularly since 
all democrats who have expressed an opinion on the nomination have 
opposed it and almost all republicans have endorsed it 
but at the same time the democratic leader said he hoped the 
tower struggle would not have an adverse impact on relations 
between the democratic majority in the senate and the administration 
i do not believe any senators decision should be based upon 
partisan considerations he said this is a personal decision 
for each senator to make 
quayle made his comments during a photo session with guatemalan 
president vinicio cerezo 
asked if towers nomination could still be salvaged he said i 
think so i hope so 
he said he was not worried about pentagon operations saying 
the pentagon is ongoing right now under acting secretary william 
h taft iv 
there will not be any interruption until we get a new secretary 
of defense quayle said 
the white house vowed to fight on in towers behalf and 
fitzwater said bush would be meeting with one or two senators on 
the question today 
were still hopeful were still going to keep working it 
well just keep up the good fight and see how it goes fitzwater 
said 
the debate over tower has become increasingly partisan in recent 
days senate republican leader bob dole after a meeting with bush 
at the white house on tuesday night said the opposition is an 
affront to the president of the united states who was elected last 
november to make these nominations

hundreds of cooking professionals at a gastronomic 
gathering this week concentrated on the chemistry of cooking and the 
history of their craft but they didnt neglect the savory stuff 
144 ways to prepare chocolate 
some seminars explored centuriesold techniques that are back in 
vogue others taught how to reconcile cooking methods of the past 
with todays busy hurried careerists one answer video shopping to 
replace timeconsuming trips to the supermarket 
people still want mommas cooking but they dont want to spend 
time doing it louise natenshon a convention official and cooking 
consultant said wednesday 
history to high tech the 11th annual gathering of the 
international association of cooking professionals joins chefs 
restaurant owners and food writers on a wide mix of subjects from 
the gastronomy of grains to formulas for preparing chocolate 
convention participants will attend workshops on such topics as 
the future of food and can recipes travel through time 
seminars in chinese cooking showed how the ancient method of 
cooking food over smoldering tea leaves is still in style 
smoking and grilling are ancient technologies but theyre also 
the wave of the future natenshon said they add a different 
kind of flavor like cajun cooking 
several participants said they came to network as well as to 
learn about cooking 
i think the most exciting thing is that people who like to eat 
are people who like life said janeen sarlin a cooking teacher 
who is one of nearly 400 participants in the convention that ends 
saturday if i learn just one thing some new way of doing 
something this week itll be worth it 
the convention could get a little technical for example an 
early workshop in hightech tips for failsafe recipes was 
clearly not for the kind of cook who relies on hamburger helper or 
macaroni and cheese 
shirley corriher an atlantabased cooking instructor and food 
consultant held a roomful of students in thrall for two hours as she 
addressed common cooking problems first she distributed lecture 
notes that included a section on the basics of emulsion 
there are 128 or more sugars found in caramel she said 
while whipping up fish chocolate sauce and a cake brioche and 
the big secret for flakiness is cold cold cold youve got 
to get chocolate up to 118 degrees but you cant get it over 120 or 
it separates out 
but its not all hard work 
participants sampled some of the goodies and will be allowed to 
kick up their heels during wine tasting a personal sensory 
analysis ways with walnuts or the fishermans feast 
billed as the finale which includes a bounty of fish from the 
north atlantic 
albert kumins luxuriate in chocolate was the most popular 
workshop according to convention spokeswoman valerie bergman 
kumin a renowned pastry chef and confectioner designed menus for 
the white house 
carol cutler the author of eight cookbooks was one of 93 
participants who signed up for kumins class 
i like the master classes but its really the networking that 
many of us come for she said like if i have some problem with 
yeast i feel a lot more comfortable calling someone across the 
country to ask about it if ive already sat down with them here 
the convention borrowed heavily from its new england locale 
workshops included traditional new england cookery boston 
baked beans brown bread and betacarotene and beyond the 
boiled lobster 
and finally for pressure cooker enthusiasts there will be a 
celebration of the 50th anniversary of the presto pressure cooker 
what national presto industries spokeswoman shelia sandy calls the 
poor mans microwave it dramatically decreased cooking time by 
the use of highpressure steam 
the event will be duly marked during the convention with a 
20pound pressure cooker sculpted in chocolate

the state senate majority leader said 
wednesday he supports gov mario cuomos plan to buy the shoreham 
nuclear power plant for 1 and dismantle it 
republican ralph marino who could kill the democratic governors 
plan endorsed it at a capitol news conference saying i think we 
should get the issue behind us at least have some kind of 
direction and this gives us stability 
under the agreement announced tuesday by cuomo and the long 
island lighting co the state would buy the 54 billion nuclear 
plant for 1 and have the state power authority dismantle it the 
neverused long island plant has waged licensing battles since its 
completion in 1985 and nearly bankrupted the utility with cost 
overruns and delays 
as part of the cuomolilco agreement approval is needed from the 
power authoritys board of directors at the moment cuomo doesnt 
have the three votes he needs from the fivemember panel marino 
could give cuomo the votes 
one of the slots on the panel is vacant and a second will be soon 
because the current members term is expiring of the remaining 
three members one supports cuomos plan one opposes it and one has 
taken no position 
for months cuomo has had two nominees for the board pending 
before the state senate for confirmation last year under the 
leadership of thensenate majority leader warren anderson the 
nominations stalled as cuomo and the state legislature battled over 
the shoreham issue 
anderson has since retired and been replaced by marino marino 
could free up the nominations and both votes are expected to be 
votes in favor of cuomos deal

social security commissioner dorcas r hardy 
urged a house panel wednesday to reject legislation that would make 
the social security administration a separate agency rather than a 
part of the department of health and human services 
i firmly believe that making ssa an independent agency would 
hinder our efforts to continue and improve our record of 
highquality service to the public ms hardy testified 
what independent agency status would do is invite and expose 
ssa to direct pressure from interest groups states and members of 
congress she said 
if such a measure were to win eventual congressional approval 
she argued it at least should be changed to provide that the agency 
be run by a single administrator rather than a threemember board as 
spelled out in the bill under consideration 
although not taking a position at the hearing for or against the 
basic concept of making social security a separate agency the 
general accounting office backed hardys call for avoiding a system 
that could result in management by committee 
as we have testified in the past we believe a more effective 
form of leadership would be a single administrator said joseph f 
delfico director of income security issues in gaos human resources 
division 
the general accounting office is congress own watchdog agency 
and delfico was careful not to offend rep andy jacobs dind 
chairman of the ways and means subcommittee on social security and 
lead author of the legislation 
delficos reference to past testimony illustrated that attempts 
to make the social security administration a separate agency are not 
new 
the idea enjoys considerable popularity particularly among house 
members because of what they say is a widely held public perception 
that making the social security administration an independent agency 
would separate it from politics 
noting that he had been supporting such proposals for years rep 
jj pickle dtexas told the panel 
despite the steady increase in the financial strength of the 
system too many people still doubt that the system will provide 
them with meaningful benefits when it is their time to retire this 
is because deep down they do not believe that the politicans and 
bureaucrats have the will to leave the program alone 
making the social security administration a separate agency would 
not exempt it from following the policies laid down by congress 
which sets both benefit levels and the withholding taxes to pay for 
them 
pickle introduced a measure to separate the agency in the 98th 
congress and similar bills have been introduced in each congress 
since including the current 101st a bill passed the house 4010 in 
1986 but was not taken up in the senate 
pickle noted that the measure has little overt opposition in 
congress but for some reason or another it always gets bottled up 
before we get it out

health officials are offering free 
inoculations to try to curb an outbreak of hepatitis believed caused 
by sewage flowing into a trailer park from an abandoned plant 
fifteen people mostly children have gotten the disease at the 
palms mobile home park in this orlando suburb since november 
orange county health officials say the wastewater discharging 
from the abandoned plant that once served the park is virtually 
untreated and could contain the infectious hepatitis virus 
rain causes water to back up from the plant into yards and 
streets where children play in it said teresa madden whose 
6yearold daughter recently had hepatitis 
bob and gina segebart said tuesday that sewage from the plant has 
been a problem since they moved into the park of about 125 mobile 
homes three years ago 
it makes me mad really mad said gina segebart i think 
the entire neighborhood is upset 
bill toth health department spokesman said the shots of gamma 
globulin will give residents temporary immunity and lessen symptoms 
which include fever jaundice an enlarged liver and intestinal 
problems 
our prime concern right now is there is a very real risk of 
transmission through raw sewage toth said if we can break the 
chain of infection anywhere along the way we can stop this thing in 
its tracks 
joe passiatore an assistant county attorney said a loophole in 
state law allows a private utility owner to walk away from a 
malfunctioning plant the owner brevard county businessman mike 
minton said he abandoned the plant early in february after trying 
to sell it to ocoee and to a private utility company 
he said he tried to buy more land to expand but the owners would 
not sell and so he gave the county city and regulatory agencies 90 
days notice that he would abandon the utility under state law the 
county became responsible for having someone take over its operation 
county commissioners monday authorized repairs until a judge can 
appoint someone to run the plant a cleanup began on tuesday 
something would have been done months ago if the mobile home park 
was not in a poor section said resident doug walker 
it is like we are not here walker said

the supreme court was urged wednesday to grant 
unemployment benefits to a man who says even though he is not a 
member of an organized religious group his christian beliefs dictate 
he not work sundays 
david a french a lawyer for william frazee of peoria ill 
said his clients right to freely exercise his religious beliefs was 
violated by the states denial of unemployment pay 
the belief must be sincerely held and it must be rooted in 
religion said french but he said once state officials accept 
that a persons refusal to work sundays fits those conditions it 
does not matter whether the person belongs to an established 
religious group or sect 
the task for the justices who are expected to decide the case by 
july may have been complicated wednesday when illinois officials 
changed the states approach to the dispute 
the illinois department of employment security previously said 
frazees basis for not working on sundays must be more than an 
individually held religious scruple the belief must be based on 
some tenets or dogma accepted by the individual of some church sect 
or denomination the agency said 
but on wednesday illinois solicitor general robert j ruiz 
argued that frazee was denied unemployment benefits not because of 
the absence of affiliation to a religious group but because his 
belief was personal rather than religious 
the sincerity of a personal belief is not the same as a 
religious belief ruiz said just because someone sincerely 
holds a belief doesnt make it religious 
even if he says that it comes from god asked justice antonin 
scalia in a tone of disbelief it seems to me you are just 
questioning if he was sincere 
the states shift in position also was challenged by justice 
sandra day oconnor 
i dont understand why you are making this argument she 
said adding that the state should have been forthright and 
confessed error 
justice anthony kennedy said the state now seems to be 
encouraging the court to affirm a patently unconstitutional 
ruling 
and justice thurgood marshall said the state appeared to be 
asking the court to decide that frazees beliefs were not sincerely 
religious even though lower courts and state agencies had not 
questioned frazees sincerity 
frazee was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits 
after he turned down a temporary job assignment in 1984 that would 
have required him to work wednesdays through sundays 
he said as a christian he believed nonemergency work on sunday 
is forbidden 
a state appeals court ruled against frazee it said the 
injunction against sunday labor must be found in a tenet or dogma of 
an established religious sect frazee does not profess to be a 
member of any such sect 
ruiz made no attempt wednesday to defend that reasoning instead 
he said frazee failed to provide enough evidence that his refusal to 
work sundays was predicated on a sincerely held religious belief 
this gentleman may have sincere beliefs ruiz said but 
there is not enough evidence to support it 
the supreme court has held three times previously that states may 
not deny unemployment benefits to people who refuse work because of 
religious scruples but in all three cases the workers based their 
claims on adherence to the teachings of an established religious 
sect 
most recently the court ruled in 1987 that florida authorities 
violated a seventhday adventists religious freedom by denying her 
unemployment pay because she refused to work on saturdays

as you cruise down the freeway and chat on 
your cellular telephone with your sweetheart lawyer bookie or 
broker bear in mind that somebody anybody could be listening 
the fact that conversations on cellular telephones can be easily 
pulled from the airwaves with inexpensive radio scanners upsets a 
lot of people including a few state legislators who have proposed a 
measure to make eavesdropping illegal action on the bill has been 
put off for a year while a legislative committee studies it 
at a hearing tuesday for the committee on energy and utilities 
one cellular phone user urged action 
if theres no prohibition against listening in why not just go 
to a cb asked lobbyist steve duncan the point for me is that 
my phone is not like a cb radio im paying more to the phone 
company to use my car phone than to use a phone at my home 
duncan is one of scores of washington residents who use a 
cellular phone for which he pays 150 a month in subscriber charges 
attorney deborah senn a legislative researcher said either 
technology must solve the problem or lawmakers must address it she 
said the problem will only grow along with the popularity of 
cellular car phones which now are estimated to number 1 million in 
the united states 
senn said legislators have heard from lawyers and physicians who 
are especially concerned at eavesdropping because some of their 
conversations are with clients and considered privileged 
were talking about a lot of sensitive phone conversations 
where people might not even be aware that somebody could be 
listening in she said 
duncan acknowledged that a state law might not stop 
eavesdroppers especially since a 1986 federal law which carries a 
500 fine for eavesdropping seems to have had little effect 
but he said at least bragging rights would stop among 
eavesdroppers who have been known to tape conversations and play 
them on commercial radio stations for entertainment he said he 
heard just such a program recently on a seattle station 
tom mcbride another researcher for the legislative committee 
said radio scanners with a megahertz band of 800 to 900 are capable 
of picking up cellular telephone conversations he said the cellular 
phone industry is working on ways to scramble conversations with 
relatively affordable technology 
european systems already are secure against eavesdroppers 
mcbride said

construction spending rose a modest 04 percent 
in january as work on nonresidential buildings such as factories 
and offices offset a downturn in activity on government projects 
the government said wednesday 
building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
424 billion in january the commerce department said januarys 
advance followed a a 21 percent increase in december and a 13 
percent jump in november 
januarys strength in construction came in the nonresidential 
sector where building activity rose 43 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 991 billion 
hotel and motel building was up 87 percent for the month 
factory construction rose 73 percent construction of office 
buildings was up 22 percent and work on religious facilities rose 
111 percent 
analysts said activity in the industrial sector has been 
bolstered as manufacturers expand capacity to meet rising demand 
generated by strong export sales although the pace of exports 
slowed during the last quarter of 1988 
we are moving into a phase in the investment cycle where we are 
doing real capacity additions to our industrial base said william 
dunkelberg dean of the school of business and management at temple 
university theres an investment boom thats still on in the 
country 
residential construction rose 11 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted 2046 billion reflecting an unchanged pace of building 
activity on singlefamily homes and a 37 percent gain in apartment 
construction 
apartment construction generally has been sluggish recently held 
back by high vacancy rates and reduced tax incentives for investment 
in such projects the category had declined 09 percent in december 
michael sumichrast an economist and editor of a construction 
newsletter said building activity has fared surprisingly well 
overall in recent months considering rising mortgage interest rates 
but while nonresidential construction is likely to remain strong 
in 1989 the rising interest rates will make it virtually certain 
that housing will start declining fairly rapidly this year 
sumichrast said 
fixedrate mortgages were averaging 1078 percent last week 
compared with 987 percent a year earlier according to a survey by 
the federal home loan mortgage corp 
government construction declined 49 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted 817 billion in january the largest category for 
government construction highways and streets was down 10 percent

a growing number of americans are filing 
simpler tax forms apparently because the new tax law reduced or 
eliminated several beneficial deductions 
the number filing the long form 1040 is down 42 percent this 
year the internal revenue service said wednesday the number filing 
the short form 1040a is up 75 percent 68 percent more 
taxpayers are filing the simplest form 1040ez than at this time 
last year 
these figures suggest that many taxpayers who filed form 1040 
in the past may be switching to the simpler shorter forms the 
irs said 
the 1986 tax overhaul eliminated deductions for state and local 
sales taxes and twoearner couples and began phasing out the 
deduction for consumer interest it also reduced writeoffs for 
medical expenses and for millions of workers it cut or eliminated 
deductions for individual retirement accounts 
through feb 24 halfway through the filing season the irs had 
received 308 million returns only about 28 percent of the 109 
million expected to file this year that is up 2 percent from the 
302 million at this time last year this years receipts included 
131 million forms 1040 85 million 1040a and 91 million 1040ez 
the irs had processed almost half the returns and had approved 
refund checks for almost 83 million taxpayers up 9in the black 
hills of south dakota 
partly cloudy skies and mild temperatures prevailed in the 
southwest 
temperatures around the nation at 2 pm est ranged from 11 below 
zero at warroad minn to 85 degrees at avon park fla the morning 
low for the nation was minus 33 at warroad

here is a transcript of remarks by former sen 
john tower of texas president bushs nominee for secretary of 
defense at the national press club on wednesday 
thank you peter for that very kind introduction 
ladies and gentlemen its a great inspiration to me to see that 
there are so many people particularly people in the mass media 
with such a profound and deepseated interest in defense management 
laughter which is what i will talk about today along with 
strategic review 
and i know youre hanging on the edges of your chairs to hear 
what i have to say about those two particular issues 
i think that this doesnt really look much like a lynch mob 
laughter but as the saying goes well know more later 
laughter 
id like to speak to you today about problems of broad scope and 
longterm significance 
in short id like to talk about the questions that normally 
occupy the mind of a nominee for secretary of defense 
its clear that a majority of the american people lack confidence 
in the way the pentagon is managing their defense dollars 
the president is extremely concerned about this attitude and has 
charged me with restoring public and congressional confidence by 
renovating the pentagons massive management structure and 
conducting a fresh review of our forces 
the primary responsibility of the secretary of defense is to 
ensure that our military forces are prepared and the policies that 
guide them will ensure the security of the nation 
his advice to the president and his proposals to congress need 
not be popular but they must be right for in no other agency lies 
the responsibility for the security of this country and the lives of 
so many men and women serving voluntarily throughout the world 
the overall military force weve planned for is not the force we 
can afford 
it is therefore imperative that the secretary of defense bring 
out every ounce of efficiency he can find in the department and 
ensure that fewer dollars are spent wisely 
it really is as simple as that 
significant and painful cuts will be made cuts that are 
prudent yes cuts that do not endanger our security certainly 
cuts that reflect a thoroughly workedout strategic design 
absolutely but cuts that will create a storm of debate both inside 
and outside the pentagon 
but then we are prepared to face such storms 
we all understand the budget crunch 
the reductions president bush and i have agreed upon are both 
necessary and significant 
weve already determined that in order to meet the grammrudman 
target 63 billion will be taken from the fiscal year 1990 budget 
these cuts come on top of four straight years of defense decline 
in which our military budget dropped 11 percent in real terms 
we must make certain that in making these cuts efficiencies are 
enhanced and our security is ensured

we should be proud of the significant and necessary resurgency of 
our military power under ronald reagan 
i make no apology for my support of that effort 
and i look back with considerable satisfaction to the deep 
bipartisan support that helped america regain her credibility in the 
eyes of the world 
but the 1980s are behind us 
we do not disparage the real achievements of the reagan 
administration when we note that the 1990s offer us some distinctive 
different challenges and threats and that our response to new 
situations will not be the fall back on old ideas 
now thats why ive spent much of the past month in the midst of 
two important initiatives mandated by president bush 
first a comprehensive review of americas national defense 
strategy 
and second the development of a plan for implementing sorely 
needed reforms of defense department management and procurement 
practices 
our review of the strategic options open to president bush has 
gone virtually unnoticed in the general clamor surrounding my 
nomination 
it has been in the works for many weeks and it is a very serious 
undertaking 
given the choices and the cuts that lie before us it only makes 
sense to begin the administration by stepping back from our current 
situation to see the world as a whole and by assessing the trends of 
uncertainties that will affect global politics in the 1990s and 
beyond 
nothing would be more dangerous than to enter into an exhaustive 
reworking of our budgets and programs without first attempting to 
understand the threats and challenges that are likely to shape that 
future world 
moreover we cannot risk a dangerous mismatch between resources 
and strategies 
our review will ensure that that does not happen 
in assessing our strategy we must first look at dominant trends 
some are encouraging 
our friends and allies have grown in economic strength and 
selfconfidence 
the soviet union seems to be undergoing unprecedented reform and 
has told us of a new thinking in foreign and military affairs 
in latin america and asia the forces of democracy and the free 
market appear to be boldly on the march 
but this is not the whole picture 
the future of secretary general gorbachevs reforms is cloudy 
not only because their success is in doubt but because we cannot be 
certain what his reforms really mean for soviet foreign policy until 
we see more concrete action 
moreover libya and other hostile states are procuring evermore 
lethal weapons that seriously threaten world peace 
the sobering truth is that even if the soviets become less of a 
threat the world will remain a dangerous place indeed 
the defense strategy review has several aspects 
the review will analyze how current trends and uncertainties 
affect the appropriateness and effectiveness of our national defense 
strategy for the 1990s 
it will identify those elements that should continue to guide our 
strategy and those elements that should be reexamined 
the review will address specific force posture issues in light of 
the reexamined national defense strategy and current budget 
constraints 
the goal will be a military force that provides the most 
effective deterrent while offering the greatest competitive leverage 
for our defense investment 
the review will examine how arms control can be used to enhance 
our national security objectives 
it will examine the basic premises underlying our approach to 
current and prospective negotiations and ensure that they are 
consistent with our defense strategy and force posture

the issues that we confront in this defense strategy review are 
some of the most difficult in government 
we face critical choices in both strategic and general purpose 
forces icbm modernization sdi the manning and composition of our 
land air and naval forces and the mix of active and reserve 
components 
we must make sound judgments about what national security demands 
and what budget constraints permit 
we must also take a dispassionate look at our arms control 
policies 
as we all know arms control is not a disembodied program but 
rather one vital element of national security policy 
we must be clear on the role arms control should play 
arms control agreements must enhance the security of the united 
states and her allies 
in the bush administration arms reductions negotiations will 
complement our overall strategic design not the other way around 
of course as we review our defense strategy and capabilities we 
must remember one critical point rebuilding our military strength 
over the past eight years was critical to our foreign policy 
successes 
maintaining that strength in the 1990s will be no less so 
it would be shortsighted indeed to conclude that because we now 
seem facetoface or seem to face a more peaceful world we can 
neglect a critical reason for current stability americas military 
power 
the planet still holds serious threats to the free world 
while there are hopeful signs there is still more promise than 
performance 
the challenge of our strategy review is to assess how with 
limited resources we can preserve our strength and our alliances 
and meet our commitments around the world 
as our defense strategy review will mold the forces of the 
decades ahead so too will it frame the most immediate concern of 
the secretary of defense reforming the way the department does 
business 
i have said plainly and repeatedly before the republican platform 
committee in july of 88 during my time with the bush campaign in 
my meetings with the president and his key advisers and most 
recently in my testimony to the senate armed services committee 
that the defense department must take a cold hard look at its 
management and procurement practices 
this is something to which the president and i assign urgent 
priority 
at the presidents direction we are well into an extensive 
management review of the department 
over two years ago the packard commission reported on the ways 
and means to reform our system of buying weapons 
the president and i embrace the commissions recommendations and 
they will be implemented with the utmost urgency that they require 
over the years literally mountains of paper and seas of ink have 
been given over to management reform reports 
the bush administration has no intention of adding yet another 
hollow call for a change 
the president wishes us to build on the best from the past to 
take account of current realities and to give him by may a course 
of action for fundamental reform 
we will detail specific actions that need to be taken to 
implement changes in four key areas people and organization 
defense planning acquisition practices and procedures and 
governmentindustry accountability 
we know that our system for buying weapons is encumbered by too 
many people and too many layers of bureaucracy 
there must be cuts 
we know that running the department demands a highly skilled and 
professional military and civilian work force 
here there must be improvements 
we know that the system is choked by a thicket of laws and 
unspeakably ponderous regulations which cost time and money 
congress and the administration must address the problem 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
we know that there are buying practices and procedures 
identified by the packard commission and a host of other experts 
that can give us better weapon systems in less time and for less 
money 
we must make the bureaucracy dance to a different tune 
allegations of corruption and abuse are all too common fare 
the publics trust in the pentagon must be restored 
it must be made crystal clear that we have zero tolerance of 
abuses and abusers 
the department of defense sometimes moves like an arthritic 
turtle and can find the most innovative ways to maintain business 
as usual 
that has got to stop 
the defense bureaucracy can be reshaped but only if people can 
be mobilized into action 
leadership can energize the individual initiative of every man 
and woman in the department and shift the course of events 
in managing the department subordinates must have the authority 
and the backing to do their jobs effectively 
they should be held strictly accountable for the results of their 
decisions 
the issue here of course is one of competence and integrity 
these attributes are not lacking in the pentagon and they need 
only to be tapped by an aggressive and hardnosed secretary 
the same high standard of accountability should extend to the 
private sector as well 
we cannot tolerate people in government or industry who fail in 
their responsibilities to the men and women of our armed forces 
our military depends on nuts and bolts and sheet metal 
we cannot be satisfied by anything but the best 
our attitude must be one of zero tolerance of abuses of the 
system 
the guilty will bear the full brunt of the law 
these efforts cannot take second place in the secretarys mind 
they must sit at the center of his desk 
they must be his daytoday concern 
i have no illusions that the way the department should be handled 
will make the secretary a universally loved individual 
popularity as you may have gathered has never been my strong 
suit 
but perhaps that in itself should be a powerful recommendation 
as some of you have suggested in your news reports ive spent a 
great deal of time thinking about what i might do as secretary of 
defense

ive shared my philosophy with the president now let me address 
this larger audience 
the secretary of defense is a profound responsibility in terms of 
the global scope of his concerns 
in a narrower sense however the secretary makes decisions that 
taken together determine whether our nation has the wherewithal to 
act when we must 
defense decisions can have no criterion save the preparedness of 
our military forces 
there can be no favorite weapons only effective weapons 
each service must understand that the secretary of defense is a 
person who can and frequently does say no 
and under current conditions no is a word that must slip 
easily off the secretarys tongue 
there can be no favorite contractor only effective and honest 
ones 
defense contractors by their performance earn the responsibility 
yes the responsibility to craft americas weapons 
the secretary of defense must select and lead topnotch 
subordinates to fulfill his mandate 
indicative of the leaders the bush administration will recruit is 
our candidate for deputy secretary donald atwood 
a proven general motors leader with extensive engineering and 
managerial experience mr atwood exemplifies the high standard we 
will demand in our defense appointees 
and let me note that one of the things that recommend don atwood 
is his experience with the defense industry 
in his position as in others ignorance of the defense industry 
is no virtue 
ultimately however the secretary of defense is in charge 
he will be the person who must ensure that the presidents vision 
and sound principles are brought to bear in defense decisions 
he must ensure that the hard choices are faced the necessary 
cuts are made the necessary reforms are carried on 
and he will accept responsibility for the results of his 
stewardship 
a secretary of course cannot escape controversy 
but if he makes sound choices congress and the american people 
will be the first to applaud 
when billions had to be backed out of the defense budget frank 
carlucci decisively cut programs and force structure and congress 
properly praised him for his doing business as usual 
a business as usual secretary is not good enough 
i want it said tower never flinched 
major and expensive systems will not survive the defense strategy 
review 
i cannot give you a cut list of weapons because such cuts 
should follow not precede our strategy review

east germany will convert some tanks into farming 
equipment and transport vehicles as part of plans to reduce its 
armed forces a government newspaper said wednesday 
the newspaper report also intensified east german pressure on 
nato to match a flurry of disarmament initiatives launched by the 
warsaw pact 
east germanys deputy defense minister gen fritz streletz was 
quoted by the neues deutschland newspaper as saying the elimination 
of 600 tanks would begin in may 
some will be scrapped while others will be converted to farm 
construction and coalcarrying vehicles the newspaper said 
calling it a unilateral disarmament move east germany in january 
announced plans to reduce the number of its troops by 10000 or 
about 6 percent by the end of next year and muster out six tank 
regiments as well as a fighter squadron 
streletz said 80000 troops were being discharged by east 
germany bulgaria hungary poland and czechoslovakia he said more 
than 2700 tanks and 800 warplanes would be eliminated by these 
socialist brother countries 
the soviets have also announced they are pulling out about 50000 
of their own troops from east bloc countries including east germany 
the east bloc initiatives have put tremendous pressure on the 
north atlantic treaty organization to come up with its own 
disarmament proposals to match those of the warsaw pact 
streletz charged that nato was continuing to hold onto its 
aggressive concepts neues deutschland reported 
we hope these warsaw pact measures provide a stimulus for 
other european countries to take their own steps toward decreasing 
their military potential he was quoted as saying

but in making those cuts i will not succumb to the temptation of 
stretchouts and postponing the tough decisions nor will i assume 
that any weapon or any force structure is sacrosanct 
with clear policy direction and consistent oversight the 
personnel of the defense department should be given the chance to do 
their jobs to the best of their ability 
we have over 2 million willing capable and dedicated people in 
the department who if given the chance can play a major role in 
providing for a strong and fiscally sound national defense 
i intend to give them that opportunity and to hold them as i ask 
you to hold me accountable for the results 
thank you very much 
ill be delighted to respond to your questions 
q thank you very much senator we do have a few questions here 
id like to begin with one senator mitchell of maine this morning 
announced his opposition to your nomination the majority leaders 
vote carries a great deal of weight can your nomination make it in 
light of it 
a i believe that the majority leader also said that individual 
senators should make up their own minds or words to that effect 
so i dont believe that hes trying to put the hammer on anyone 
or i would not guess that he is based on statement that 
individual senators should come to their own conclusions 
q senator hollings this morning said you had made pledges to 
abstain from alcohol before and broken them can we believe the 
latest one 
a i dont know what senator hollings is referring to 
i dont recall any such 
but the fact is this is not a pledge it is an oath that i have 
taken have taken for to and before the american people 
and i regard such oaths as sacred 
and i can assure you i will abide by it 
q you said sunday youve never broken a pledge in your life 
does this include wedding vows 
a as a matter of fact i have broken wedding vows 
i think i am probably not alone in that connection 
q senator have you considered waiving the privacy provisions of 
the fbi report so that portions of it could be released to the 
public 
a its not up to me to waive the privacy provisions 
the privacy provisions i think apply essentially to the people 
who were interviewed and i dont think its within the purview of 
my power to waive anything 
i have not seen the fbi report i dont know whats in it and i 
cant comment on really on or express any attitude on what 
should be done with the report in terms of revealing sections of it 
or all of it or a redacted version of it 
i simply have no way of making a judgment

iberia airlines has lost 50 million in 
business since jan 1 due to a threemonth strike by jet mechanics 
over training pay and work benefits the airlines president said 
wednesday 
iberia president narcis andreu also told parliaments industry 
committee the recent discovery of nine cases of sabotage of jets had 
forced extra inspections and the cancellation of at least 10 
transoceanic flights costing 43 million 
andreu took pains however to avoid blaming the sabotage on the 
1600 members of the the spanish association of aircraft maintenance 
technicians who have carried out many oneday strikes since dec 23 
andreu also said it had 73 percent fewer passengers between jan 
1 and feb 27 compared with the same period last year he 
attributed the drop to the 25 percent reduction in its 350 to 450 
daily flights since january caused by the mechanics strike 
the union has pressured iberia for a separate agreement to 
guarantee training to meet international specifications out of fear 
its members could lose their jobs in 1993 when the european economic 
community creates a unified labor pool and establishes common labor 
standards 
the jet mechanics form part of a contract that includes the 
companys 21000 ground employees 
andreu said he would not agree to the mechanics union demands 
for a separate agreement because it would lead to calls by other 
groups within the ground employees for separate agreements 
increasing conflicts in negotiations and eventually reducing the 
companys competitivity 
he said 100 of the unions mechanics had been fired for failing 
to meet minimum services decreed by the transport ministry on strike 
days another 353 mechanics had been sanctioned for disciplinary 
reasons he said

iran has banned imports of cigarettes and 
tobacco due to the high cost of imports and scarce foreign exchange 
the islamic republic news agency reported wednesday 
the agency monitored in nicosia said that details on the ban 
such as when it took effect were not available but reported that 
the ban was announced by the state tobacco company during a oneday 
seminar in the tobaccogrowing town of tirtash in northern 
mazandaran province 
it said that iran imported 15400 tons of tobacco and cigarettes 
during 198586 at a cost of 1244 million mainly from bulgaria and 
switzerland 
but during a fiveyear period starting in 1982 tobacco 
production in iran grew from 21000 tons per year to 24000 tons 
the agency said 
iranians can purchase cigarettes with governmentissued coupons 
for 450 per pack the agency reported but in the flourishing 
black market the better brands of locally made cigarettes cost as 
much as the equivalent of 15 a pack 
smuggled usmade winston cigarettes fetch the premium price 
of about 18 per pack 
soaring prices have forced many smokers to buy single cigarettes 
which are sold at roadsides by enterprising men who buy cigarette 
coupons from nonsmokers and sell single cigarettes to make a 
greater profit 
last year the joke among iranian smokers was that if cigarette 
prices rose any higher they would find roadside kiosks selling 
single puffs of cigarettes

a parliamentary committee criticized the government 
wednesday for its handling of a salmonellaineggs crisis triggered 
by a junior ministers remark that most british egg production was 
infected 
the agriculture select committee said the likelihood of an egg 
being infected with salmonella is very small but cautioned that a 
sharp rise in salmonella poisoning cases from 10000 in 1981 to 
23000 in the first 10 months of 1988 was cause for concern 
egg sales fell 60 percent after the junior health minister 
edwina currie said dec 3 that most egg production was infected 
with salmonella confronted by lawsuits from farmers mrs currie 
resigned but the affair prompted a major public debate about food 
hygiene 
the committee said the government and not just mrs currie was 
to blame from failing to correct her wrong remark 
critics have accused the government of siding with food 
producers neglecting the interests of consumers and issuing 
conflicting statements that confused the public 
last month the government ordered an inquiry into food safety 
after warning pregnant women against eating soft cheeses and 
ordering farmers to slaughter salmonellainfected chickens 
health secretary kenneth clarke said wednesday the government had 
issued health warnings that were very clear 
i accept that we have got to do more to tell people about the 
safe handling of food he told the bbc 
prime minister margaret thatcher shares the concern of the rest 
of the government that the health of the public is properly 
protected and british farming produces high quality food and also 
that we keep things in proportion clarke said 
the committee said more should have been done sooner by the 
government to prevent eggs entering the food chain from farms 
responsible for poisoning outbreaks 
it urged the government to spend more on research to counter food 
poisoning bring in better procedures for tracing outbreaks to their 
source and reduce contamination in animal foodstuffs 
the governments chief medical officer sir donald acheson said 
in january that salmonella in eggs is a serious health problem but 
only a very few eggs are infected

q as head of the tower commission investigating the irancontra 
affair you gave george bush a clean bill of health some say your 
nomination is a payoff for that and thats why he is sticking with 
you in the face of strong opposition your comment 
a i think that when you consider the fact that the commission 
was made up of three people brent scowcroft and ed muskie in 
addition to myself that that would be sort of impugning the 
integrity of brent scowcroft and ed muskie 
i dont know whether the questioner intended to impugn them 
because i had an equal voice with them on this report 
we found nothing to implicate the vice president 
i might add that the joint congressional committee found nothing 
to implicate the vice president 
i wonder what kind of payoff theyre going to get 
q one washington columnist jack germond this morning on the 
today program said you were not a cuddly or very wellliked 
member of the senate when you were there do you think that the lack 
of affection of your former colleagues is playing an inordinate role 
in your current crisis 
a well that would only be guesswork on my part 
as a matter of fact i have heard various commentators say that 
some of my old colleagues had some scores to settle with me and were 
prepared to settle those scores 
i dont believe thats true 
i believe it might be true that im not universally popular with 
all of them but i dont think that would be considered a motivation 
for their vote for or against me because i have some very good 
friends that hold me in deep affection and have told me so that are 
not going to vote for my confirmation 
i know of some in the senate who have said that they have very 
little affection for me who are going to vote for me 
so i would have to discount that as a factor 
q do you believe as some apparently do that the opposition to 
you is mostly partisan and please explain what you think the 
democrats would gain by opposing your nomination 
a i think it remains to be seen whether or not the opposition 
turns out to be totally partisan 
i hope that some of my democrat friends whove expressed 
privately to me that they feel im highly qualified and that they 
see nothing that has come to light to date to disqualify me will 
vote for me 
but i want to make an additional comment 
i think if it turns out that way that its a significant 
development in american politics 
i think it raises the question is character assassination a 
legitimate and acceptable means of the exercise of political power 
if that question is answered in the affirmative we have ushered 
in a new and rather ugly phase in american politics 
q do you believe the senates decision then on your confirmation 
will be essentially a political one president bush vs senator

the state department said wednesday it would 
keep talking to the palestine liberation organization and look for 
concrete steps toward peace in the middle east 
the five usplo meetings since december have been described by 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir as useless and in an 
interview with the washington times he said chairman yasser arafat 
and adolf hitler belong to the same family of demagogues and 
totalitarians 
the state department spokesman charles e redman declined to 
respond directly to shamirs statement about the us dialogue with 
the plo however redman said it was the basic approach and 
objective to hopefully produce concrete steps that contribute to 
peace in the middle east 
at the last session on tuesday in tunisia us ambassador 
robert pelletreau criticized a raid by three plo guerrillas in 
southern lebanon about a mile from israels border 
however redman made it clear that the talks would be continued 
this dialogue is not an end in itself he said and when 
asked to assess the results so far redman said this is still 
early going in the process 
meanwhile edward s walker a deputy assistant secretary of 
state indicated to a house subcommittee wednesday that the plo had 
provided useful information regarding counterterrorism 
asked by rep larry smith dfla about a statement two weeks 
ago by the state departments top counterterrorism official that the 
plo had not furnished information on the pan american jetliner that 
crashed after exploding over scotland in december walker replied 
i couldnt make that same statement today 
however other us officials speaking on condition they not be 
named said the plo had not provided information on that flight one 
said walker did not mean to indicate the information concerned the 
plo flight 
shamir said in the times interview published wednesday that if 
arafat flew to israel as the late egyptian president anwar sadat did 
on a 1977 peace mission wed put him in prison 
interviewed in jerusalem by arnaud de borchgrave the newspapers 
editorinchief the israeli leader called king hussein of jordan 
with whom he has offered to negotiate terms for an arabisraeli 
settlement an element of stability in the region 
but shamir said if a palestinian state is to be established it 
should be located on the east bank of the jordan river where 
husseins kingdom stands 
if the jordanian population one day decides to have a 
palestinian state there its up to them he said 
although jordan does not provide precise population figures it is 
believed to be at least 70 percent palestinian 
the west bank meanwhile which jordan ruled from 1947 until the 
territory was captured by israel in the 1967 war has nearly 1 
million palestinians and about 60000 jews 
shamir took a tough stand on these issues as the bush 
administration pondered its policy toward the middle east israeli 
foreign minister moshe arens who is also a hardliner is due here 
for talks in two weeks with secretary of state james a baker iii 
and vice president dan quayle 
arens also may see president bush 
ending a 13year ban the united states opened a dialogue with 
the plo last december over israels objections there have been 
five meetings so far in tunisia where the plo maintains its 
headquarters 
asked if the dialogue is a bad idea shamir said i think its 
useless not healthy because it gives the plo more prestige and 
importance and in such a way that it discourages moderate elements 
who would like to find a path to real peace with israel 
shamir said there were many moderate elements among the 
palestinians but when they see the americans talking to the plo 
they cannot muster the courage to do anything else he said 
the us talks with the plo were based on a judgment by the 
reagan administration that arafat had renounced terrorism accepted 
israels right to exist and subscribed to un security council 
resolutions upholding the right of all states in the area to live 
within secure borders 
but shamir did not detect any change in arafats attitude 
history is replete with such phenomena who after a while 
disappear when they have outlived their usefulness he said 
take hitler there was a time in the 1930s when hitler was 
celebrated the world over as some kind of savior the end we know

a again i think we have to see this thing play out and make our 
judgments subsequent to the way the debate develops and the outcome 
of the vote 
so i think its perhaps a little bit early to comment on that 
q senator what has angered you most about the way your 
nomination is being considered 
a when so many of my colleagues have said that i was publicly 
qualified or publicly said that i was qualified and some 
democrats who voted against me in the senate indicated that early 
on they had intended to vote for me and had complimented me on my 
expertise my background and experience and my record of 
leadership that i suppose one thing that i think engenders some 
resentment is the fact that there was no clearly defined standard 
against which i should be judged 
the standard seemed to be developed and seemed to evolve to fit 
the situation 
now several senators have said that the secretary of state must 
adhere to a higher standard than members of the united states senate 
i accept that 
i accept that the secretary of defense must adhere to a higher 
standard than members of the united states senate 
but my question is how much lower an acceptable standard is 
there for members of the senate 
is it an acceptable standard for senators late in the evening 
whove had a few drinks in the hideaways and offices of the capitol 
a few steps away from the senate chamber to come onto the floor 
late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear deterrence 
is it an acceptable standard for senators to accept honoraria 
pac contributions and paid vacations from special interests who 
have a vested interest in the legislative process 
i think in the course of formulating a standard for the 
secretary of defense or indeed for any other cabinet officer that 
it is time that the congress articulated what its own standards are 
q would it be advantageous to your nomination for the senate to 
delay its vote 
a well thats a judgment that i cant make 
there are some who say that an early vote might be to my 
advantage others that say that if it plays out for a little while 
longer maybe the situation would change 
i cant make that assessment now 
i am not a prophet 
and ive found that sometimes prophesizing is a dangerous 
business so i will not engage in it now

one hundred years after a naples chef 
presented the queen of italy with a patriotic pizza purists and 
politicians want to copyright the simple recipe for a genuine 
neapolitan pie 
representatives from the italian association for real pizza the 
association of european pizza makers and the province of naples met 
tuesday to define exactly what makes a neapolitian pizza 
all over the world pizza is sold and consumed but often it is 
a product that has nothing in common with the original neapolitan 
one said gennero ambrosio industry commissioner for the province 
of naples 
it is of course impossible to copyright a recipe but to 
define the characteristic ingredients of real neapolitan pizza is a 
step toward keeping a pizza with mushrooms or hot dogs on it from 
being called a neapolitan pizza he said 
on june 11 1889 a young neapolitan pizza chef set out for the 
royal palace on a mule with his wife and a sack of ingredients to 
try out a new recipe on queen margherita di savoia 
the queen enjoyed the dish and asked the chef raffaele esposito 
what it was called it does not have a name but from now on it 
will be called as your majesty he is said to have replied 
esposito had departed from the traditional pizza ingredients of 
the times garlic oregano and sardines or dried cheese he instead 
used red tomato sauce white mozzarella cheese and green basil the 
colors of the italian flag 
so impressed was the queen by this patriotic culinary invention 
that she awarded esposito a certificate of merit on display now at 
the naples pizzeria of espositos greatgrandson vincenzo brandi 
real neapolitan pizza according to backers is made with all 
fresh ingredients and if possible ones from the naples area the 
thin crispy layer of dough is made from flour salt and water and 
is baked in ovens fired only by wooden logs 
the true kinds of neapolitan pizza are the margherita and the 
marinara which uses olive oil tomato paste garlic and oregano 
according to the real pizza association 432 million pizzas are 
cooked each year in the more than 12000 pizzerias in italy 
debates ceremonies and festivals are being planned for the 
centennial this summer in naples to honor the citys pizza 
the 100th birthday of the margherita is the perfect opportunity 
to increase public interest in the purity of the product ambrosio 
said

president bushs ethics panel agreed wednesday 
that adding lesser penalties will increase enforcement of 
conflictofinterest laws which now carry felony sentences 
this is much needed said former attorney general griffin 
bell vice chairman of the panel it takes a harshness out of the 
law and makes the law much more effective now when you have a close 
case you just dont prosecute you dont do anything 
the panels draft report predicted by providing alternative 
prosecutorial tools that can be more carefully tailored to the 
offense these sanctions may expand the number of enforcement 
actions 
with a series of decisions at its fifth meeting wednesday the 
eightmember panel wrapped up all but the final drafting of a report 
it hopes to give bush late next week most of the recommendations 
require approval by him and congress 
the laws which prohibit federal officials from using their office 
for personal gain and which limit lobbying by former officials now 
carry felony penalties of up to two years in prison and a 250000 
fine 
the panel recommended that these and several other conflict 
statutes be given misdemeanor penalties and civil fines as well as 
felony sentences 
misdemeanor penalties can range up to one year in prison and a 
100000 fine they said the civil fines should be the larger of 
either a specific amount set by congress or an amount equal to the 
financial gain the official reaped by violating the law 
civil fines can be imposed on the basis of the preponderance of 
the evidence criminal convictions require meeting the tougher 
standard of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt the panel said willful 
violations should still be punished as felonies but negligent or 
inadvertent violations should carry the lesser penalties 
r james woolsey a lawyer and former undersecretary of the navy 
said scientific and technical people considering whether to work for 
government have worried that any violation of these laws makes 
them a felon its far more reasonable if a mistake does not lead to 
a felony 
the panel sidestepped the hardest decisions about what had become 
its most divisive issue moonlighting by judges members of 
congress top executive branch officials and top aides in all three 
branches 
the members agreed there should be a uniform limit on the outside 
income earned by all top officials but called on congress to set the 
limit and to let the president exempt some activities like 
scholarly writing 
their compromise recommendation was that congress limit outside 
earned income to a fixed percentage of an officials salary a 
majority of the group favored a figure closer to the 15 percent 
which now governs the executive branch rather than the higher 
amounts allowed in congress and the judiciary 
the judiciary has no limit the house limit is 30 percent of 
salary the senate limit 40 percent 
the commission also proposed that congress allow the president to 
exempt income from categories of work that do not raise ethical 
issues or interfere with the full performance of official duties 
this idea emerged after the commission tried but failed to agree on 
a list of exemptions 
former white house counsel lloyd cutler suggested listing 
teaching by judges among others but bell who wanted to exempt 
royalties from books or inventions objected to exempting teaching 
by judges 
when you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching youre 
not a fulltime government worker bell said youre not in your 
office when youre teaching and you need to be there so other judges 
can talk to you 
other recommendations approved wednesday 
that political appointees should have to publicly disclose their 
home mortgage loans and debts to relatives assets worth more than 
1 million and income over 250000 those debts are now exempt from 
disclosure the highest asset disclosure category now is over 
250000 and for income is over 100000 
that a threebranch commission modeled on the sentencing 
commission recently upheld by the supreme court try to standardize 
ethics forms between the branches and issue advisory opinions on how 
to fill them out 
that a panel of private citizens be recruited to give the 
president nonpublic advice on questions involving the appearance of 
a conflict of interest which go beyond formal interpretations of the 
laws 
that the law authorizing independent counsels to investigate top 
executive officials should apply to members of congress as well if 
the law is retained an issue on which the panel took no position 
that congress set up a joint ethics staff to give the house and 
senate uniform advice on ethical questions

q senator youve taken a beating in the press embarrassing 
stories have been written about your personal life what are your 
feelings about this 
a well i cant say well i guess i should say i feel a little 
bit like the fellow that was had been immersed in tar and feathers 
and was being ridden out of town on a rail 
and he said really gentlemen if it werent for the honor 
id rather hitchhike laughter 
obviously it has not been comfortable 
i think that there has been too much of an eagerness on the part 
of some aspects of the media to rush into print or on the airwaves 
with unsustained allegations 
and theres an old saying of course that the answer never 
catches up with the charge 
the charge might be a fourcolumn head above the fold on the 
front page and the answer when it comes refuting the charge or 
rebutting it or disproving it might come back on page 23 somewhere 
in the patent medicine ads 
so its not a comfortable situation 
and i think my own impression is that i wish there could be more 
balance 
if i had to look at any single medium and say that thats an 
example of balance i would have to recant some earlier things that 
i have said about that organization and say that i think that really 
the standard for balance and fairness has been exhibited by the 
washington post 
q under what set of circumstances would you withdraw your name 
for consideration by the senate 
a william barret travis who was the commandant of the alamo 
laughter incidentally tomorrow is texas independence day 
laughter and i will be glad to read travis last letter from the 
alamo to anyone who would like to assemble with me tomorrow and 
listen to it 
but travis in that last letter from the alamo said i shall 
never surrender or retreat applause 
wait a minute 
im laughter im a little sorry i brought up the alamo 
analogy because laughter because it just occurred to me what 
happened at the alamo laughter just 10 days after travis wrote 
that letter laughter 
but the ultimate outcome was a happy one because sam houston was 
able to withdraw his army to the side to sort of there pounce upon 
the superior army of santa ana and defeat it in one of the great 
decisive battles of the world laughter applause

last years settlement of a trade dispute with 
south korea cleared the way for rapid growth in us sales of 
cigarettes and leaf tobacco to that thriving asian market according 
to an agriculture department report 
cigarette manufacturers have clearly won by gaining access to 
this market which earned them 564 million in 1988 and holds 
promise for even greater annual earnings in the future the 
departments foreign agricultural service said 
shipments of unmanufactured leaf tobacco to south korea last 
year were valued at less than 10 million but that was the most 
since us leaf exports were about 40 million in 1981 the 564 
million in cigarette shipments was the most ever 
us cigarettes have historically faced stringent trade 
restrictions in this market the report said prior to 1986 it 
was illegal for korean citizens even to possess foreign cigarettes 
this prohibition was lifted in 1986 but us cigarettes continued 
to face tought trade restrictions 
the restrictions led the us cigarette export association to 
file a complaint with the us trade representative on jan 1 1988 
charging that south korea had violated the us trade act 
under the 1974 law the president can take action including 
retaliation to obtain the removal of any foreign barrier found to 
be in violation of international agreement or discriminatory 
negotiations produced a record of understanding signed with 
south korea on may 27 1988 which eased restrictions on us 
cigarettes carried out by the korean monopoly corp or komoco 
now us cigarettes are not subject to an import quota the 
report said import and domestic taxes have been reduced further 
restrictions on advertising and promotion have been reduced price 
restrictions have been removed and cigarettes can be distributed 
independent of komoco 
the report added soon after the agreement was signed us 
manufacturers began to sign sales agreements with korean firms and 
us cigarette exports began to explode 
in june 1988 us cigarette shipments to south korea increased 
30fold from may for the entire year sales totaled 24 billion 
cigarettes or pieces a 670 percent increase from 312 million 
pieces in 1987 
in recent years south korean cigarette consumption has 
increased an average of 5 percent annually the report said 
increased consumption is attributable to the tremendous growth in 
personal income and increased consumption by women and students 
the report also credits komoco with an aggressive promotion 
campaign to help boost sales of domestic brands many of which are 
using greater amounts of us tobacco leaf

the head of the states parole program 
conceded that it was a mistake to release a twiceconvicted child 
molester who was arrested again this week on charges of abducting 
and raping a young girl 
we made a bad decision on this case no question about it 
guy revell chairman of the florida parole and probation commission 
said tuesday 
frank potter 43 was paroled by officials both in florida and 
new jersey in 1987 he was arrested in tampa on monday and charged 
with abducting and sexually assaulting a 7yearold girl as she was 
on her way to school three weeks earlier 
twice before potter was paroled after serving time for sexual 
assaults on children in palmetto fla in 1968 and in lakewood 
nj in 1976 
in all potter had been sentenced to 55 years in prison in both 
states and served fewer than 20 years 
revell said a probation officer recommended in a memo in july 
that potter needs to be in a more structured situation than 
regular parole and recommended community control with an 
electronic monitoring device 
revell said it was only a matter of time before potters sentence 
was to end so the commission gave him parole on condition he attend 
a treatment program 
and it didnt work out revell said we tried and the man 
violated we tried to protect the community as best we could through 
some sort of formal treatment program

house speaker jim wright condemned wednesday as 
preposterous a published report that he had threatened to blow 
the whistle on a texas federal savings and loan regulator said to be 
homosexual 
the report in wednesdays washington times said that wright 
dtexas made the threat in an effort to get better treatment for 
texas savings and loan institutions whose officials had complained 
to him and that the issue had figured in the report of a special 
outside counsel investigating charges against wright for the house 
ethics committee 
the story is preposterous wright said in a statement 
read to reporters at his daily news conference this entire report 
is antithetical to my personality i dont threaten people 
the allegation that wright improperly sought to influence sampl 
regulators is one of six allegations against the speaker that are 
the subjects of a ninemonth ethics probe the ethics panel is 
expected to announce some action in the case the week of march 13 
wright acknowledged expressing concerns in 1986 and 1987 about 
regulatory conduct in texas to edwin gray then chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board which oversees savings and loan 
institutions but he said the exchange was consistent with the 
work done by members of congress all the time 
wright said he had submitted to the ethics committee an affidavit 
and a letter from two people present at meetings with gray and other 
sampl regulators in 1986 and 1987 who contend he made no improper 
requests of the officials 
wright did not respond directly when asked whether he had raised 
with gray the allegations of homosexuality saying only that he 
would not indulge in rumors 
published reports and sources close to wright say the speaker 
expressed concerns at the time that a top fhlbb official in texas 
was pressuring state sampl executives to hire the regulators 
homosexual associates as consultants and attorneys

president daniel ortega on wednesday 
warned critics of his austerity plan not to instigate protests 
similiar to the unrest in venezuela 
ortega said the opposition and the yankee empire would be the 
first victims of such an uprising 
his speech came the day after the sandinista government devalued 
its currency and raised fuel prices for the sixth time this year it 
also followed days of frontpage stories in nicaraguan newspapers 
about violent protests sparked by similar austerity measures 
if a situation develops here like that of venezuela if workers 
lose their heads and fall into the trap laid by rightwingers if 
they lose faith in the revolution they will rob and raid the 
establishments of rightwing businessmen ortega said 
the leftist sandinistas took power in a 1979 revolution that 
ended decades of the prous somoza family dictatorship 
if there is someone trying to sow uncertainty and instability 
in this country it is the yankee empire through its spokesmen 
political parties radio stations businessmen and newspapers who 
clumsily launch that campaign without realizing they would be the 
first victims of the wave theyre trying to stimulate ortega said 
in a speech opening the new semester at a local high school 
the president blamed the united states and other industrialized 
nations for the economic crises in nicaragua and venezuela 
he said in nicaragua rightwing groups politicians and radio 
stations speak against the economic measures of the disaster of the 
nicaraguan situation ortega said 
he called it the tolling of a bell calling the people to 
insurrection 
they fail to understand that with these attitudes they are 
playing with fire which could end up burning them he said 
the riots in venezuela came after the monthold government of 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez announced a sweeping 
economic reform package under pressure from internatonal creditors 
although nicaragua does not face the same pressure from 
creditors it is suffering from inflation that hit 20000 percent 
last year and ortegas harsh austerity program resembles venezuelas 
in many ways 
the sandinista program announced jan 30 includes devaluations 
cuts in public spending higher fuel prices massive layoffs of 
public employees restricting credit and slashing capital investment 
our country demands effort sacrifice and productivity from all 
nicaraguans ortega said wednesday 
he said his economic program is working and that inflation which 
hit 97 percent in january alone was only 40 or 41 percent in 
february 
we were expecting a much higher inflation rate but our 
measures are showing results thanks to the efforts of the popular 
sectors and of responsible businessmen he said 
nicaraguas currency the cordoba has been devalued six times so 
far this year each time the cost of food and fuel has risen in 
part because food has to be trucked into the city from the 
countryside 
the latest devaluation was announced wednesday with the official 
exchange rate now 4200 cordobas to the us dollar up from 3800 
cordobas 
fuel prices also rose 1000 cordobas with a gallon of gasoline 
now selling for 8900 cordobas ortega said that fuel prices will 
rise in the future but not by as much as over the last two months

president bushs determination to stick by john 
tower in his messy struggle for confirmation demonstrates a 
remarkable premium on personal loyalty and a stubborn belief that a 
president is entitled to have the people he wants in his cabinet 
despite allegations against tower of excessive drinking 
womanizing and conflict of interest with pentagon contractors bush 
has never wavered in his support for his fellow texan and longtime 
friend to run the defense department 
ive made my call bush said wednesday ive looked at the 
record ive known this man since 1959 and my support is 
unequivocal john tower is in my view the best man for this job 
thus at the risk of a damaging political loss bush is heading 
for a senate showdown that he easily could lose the episode 
threatens to sour a honeymoon with congress that already has been 
strained by wrangling over the budget 
the white house says the battle is stained by partisanship but 
with the democrats holding a 5545 edge in the senate a partisan 
fight is the last kind of test bush should want 
it promises to get ugly with democrats and republicans trading 
sharp charges and insults 
strategically this is the worst thing that could happen to 
bush the longer this goes on the more people are going to say 
things theyre going to regret said stephen hess a specialist in 
the presidency at the brookings institution 
a new president should try to engineer an early decisive 
victory when people are really noticing he should do something he 
wins hess said its almost as if george bush has engineered a 
defeat 
white house deputy chief of staff andrew card said bush 
believes the president should have the right to put people in the 
cabinet unless it could be shown without any question that they 
are not qualified 
in a statement aimed squarely at the senate bush said look 
do what youve got to do but remember fair play remember decency 
and honor and then remember also historically the concept of advise 
and consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to the 
president of the united states who after all is responsible for 
the executive branch of this government 
over the past 200 years only eight cabinet nominees have been 
rejected by the senate and never in the first stages of a presidency 
after examining fbi reports bush refuses to believe any of the 
charges against tower and argues that its wrong for anyone to be 
judged by rumors and innuendo 
the president has known john tower longer than anyone in the 
united states senate has known him said phil trulock the 
heritage foundation vice president who was among a group of 
conservatives that met with bush on wednesday he knows probably 
better than anyone the senators shortfallings and his strengths 
bush and tower have a long history of political favors back in 
1960 bush was the harris county chairman for towers first race for 
the senate 
more recently at the drop of a hat tower packed his bags during 
the presidential race to campaign alongside bush particularly in 
the big battleground state of texas 
when people were drawing up the names for a defense secretary 
under bush towers name was always first 
washingtons rumor mill has also buzzed with unproven speculation 
that towers appointment was a political payoff for having headed a 
commission that essentially cleared bush of any significant role in 
the irancontra scandal of the reagan administration 
tower brushed that idea aside wednesday saying congressional 
investigators also found nothing to implicate bush 
i wonder what kind of payoff theyre going to get tower 
asked 
whatever the outcome bush has tried to limit the political 
damage by refusing to be drawn into a namecalling fingerpointing 
fight with his democratic opponents 
the one good thing about the president is that he understands 
politics and he knows that most people dont hold grudges and can 
move from one issue to the next without a lot of bias said card

communities should be allowed to protect 
younger teenagers by banning anyone over 18 from dance halls that 
cater to minors the supreme court was told wednesday 
dallas is attacking the juvenile crime problem and the 
influence older people can have on juveniles craig lee hopkins 
argued in urging reinstatement of the texas citys age limits for 
patronizing certain types of dance halls 
hopkins said local governments do not infringe on peoples right 
to associate with whom they please by imposing such bans 
there is no constitutional right of association reaching a 
dance hall he said even if there were such a right hopkins 
added the dallas ordinance still served the compelling interest of 
protecting younger teenagers 
but lawyer daniel sheehan jr representing a dallas dance hall 
owner said we are asking the court to recognize the right to 
associate even if the purpose is social 
although the word association does not appear in the 
constitution a long series of supreme court decisions have 
recognized such a right including political and familial 
associations 
but the court has never said that such constitutional protection 
extends to social or recreational associations as well 
a texas appeals court recognized such a right in 1987 when it 
struck down the dallas ordinance that licensed certain dance halls 
on the condition only teens aged 14 to 18 be admitted as patrons 
the ordinance made exceptions for parents legal guardians and 
dance hall employees 
the city appealed to the nations highest court a decision is 
expected by july 
all nine justices asked questions during a lively hourlong 
argument session wednesday 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
and sandra day oconnor seemed most impressed by hopkins arguments 
that even if 14yearolds have a right to associate with people 
older than 18 the city may create a safe harbor by inhibiting 
that right in dance halls 
at one point a seemingly dubious rehnquist asked sheehan why the 
dance hall age limits are any less constitutional than statutory 
rape laws making it a crime to have sex with a minor 
the dallas ordinance was challenged successfully in state courts 
by charles m stanglin who operates the twilight skating rink 
stanglin has a class e dance hall license issued to those 
dance halls catering to minors 
he divided the floor of his skating rink so that patrons dance or 
skate to the same music in full view of one another people over 18 
can be admitted to the skating rink but not to the dance hall 
contending that the ordinance may betray many dallas residents 
religiously based bias against dancing sheehan asked if the 
problem is older teens corrupting younger teens why are they only 
barred on a dance floor 
scalia smiling broadly suggested that the city may be moving 
on roller rinks next one evil at a time 
justice harry a blackmun voiced surprise when the citys lawyer 
said about 500 dance halls hold licenses 
do they do anything else in dallas blackmun asked 
the case is dallas vs stanglin 871848

members of a presidential panel wednesday 
defended their plan to close us military bases telling lawmakers 
the decisions were based on military value 
the commissions cochairs former sen abraham ribicoff 
dconn and former rep jack edwards rala also disputed 
lawmakers claims that the decisions were based on faulty data or 
conclusions 
ribicoff and edwards testifying before the house subcommittee on 
military installations and facilities defended the dec 30 report 
of the commission on base realignment and closure 
we did not just pluck these recommendations out of midair 
ribicoff said 
disputing charges that the commission played politics edwards 
added military value is really the touchstone of the process 
ribicoff and edwards were supported by a top congressional 
investigator who said he has yet to find glaring errors in the 
commissions data 
edwards and ribicoff were on capitol hill to fend off criticism 
of their report which was proposed by congress in an attempt to 
solve the politically difficult problem of closing military bases 
the baseclosing panel planning to close some 86 installations 
and partially shut five others expects its recommendations to save 
56 billion over 20 years 
congress is scheduled to vote within weeks on the 
recommendations which must be either endorsed in whole or refused 
in whole 
most criticism has come from lawmakers facing base closings in 
their areas some lawmakers say the decisions are based on bad 
conclusions and that transfer of some doomed bases functions will 
cost as much or more money than they will save 
rep larry hopkins rky said he orginally supported the 
legislation calling for the commissions report but hopkins said he 
has been concerned by calculations that show the closures might not 
save money 
if were not im not going to support it he said 
for example the commission estimates reductions at fort dix 
nj will save 845 million a year a report by the secretary of 
defenses office predicts the change will cost 190 million in new 
military construction and 182 million in other implementation 
costs 
deputy assistant defense secretary robert stone who provided the 
cost estimates defended them 
there is an old adage that it takes money to make money for 
base closures it takes money to save money stone told the 
subcommittee 
ribicoff said the commission made its recommendations after 
serious consideration criticism was expected he said change 
is not always welcomed in fact it can be threatening 
we were heartened by the substantial evidence showing that 
communities do recover from the temporary dislocations that result 
from a base closing many end up much better off ribicoff said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo the subcommittee chairwoman 
asked edwards about speculation some of the decisions may have been 
motivated by politics 
we were not only bipartisan we were nonpartisan edwards 
replied 
frank conahan a ranking official of congress general accounting 
office said his agency has yet to find fault with the commissions 
overall recommendations 
we have not found any glaring errors said conahan adding 
the gaos review will continue

a i have already outlined some of the terms of reference for our 
internal management reforms 
rather than try to go into detail with you because thats 
currently under development i think i should simply say that we 
look forward to full implementation of the packard commission report 
the packard commission recommendations doing all that we can 
administratively and then at the point where we have done all that 
we can administratively go to congress and ask for congressional 
help and whatever statutory relief statutory changes that are 
required to reduce the overlayered bureaucracy in the 
micromanagement that now exists and the maze of statutes and 
regulations that are often in conflict with themselves 
i think what is indicated probably is a recodification of all of 
our procurement statutes 
q would you comment on the state of the current relationship 
between the department and the defense supply industry should it be 
improved and how would you do that especially in view of your own 
personal perceived conflict of interest by some 
a well in terms of my own case thats a perception of an 
appearence 
there is none because i have no continuing financial arrangement 
with any defense contractor 
i severed all my relationships with them as of the first of 
december of last year three months ago 
and so i have no continuing financial interests 
i have no particular loyalty to any particular contractor 
i think contractors must be held accountable for what they are 
responsible for 
and i believe that we should insist on value for the dollar that 
we spend with them 
and i think we should insist that they be honest in their 
dealings with the defense department 
and i believe that its high time that they undertook a 
substantial policing of their own industry and embarked on a 
selfimprovement program 
and i think if that is not successful then we have to impose 
certain disciplines on the contractors ourselves 
q what is your view of proposals to use certain elements of the 
armed forces in the program to interdict drug shipments into this 
country 
a i believe that we should use them as effectively as possible 
i think that unfortunately there are a lot of misconceptions 
about how effectively military assets can be used in interdicting 
the drug traffic 
some have gone so far as to suggest that we take the entire force 
of the united states army that is currently based in the united 
states and deployed along the border 
i dont think that would be an effective means of the use of the 
military

politicians and rightwing activists have 
formed an organization promoting the reelection of military 
president augusto pinochet who was lost a referendum last year on 
whether he should remain in office 
claudio morales a former councilman in valparaiso said the 
group is made up of social leaders independent politicians and 
members of various rightwing parties who are convinced that the 
best candidate we may have is pinochet 
the group was organized tuesday night in valparaiso 75 miles 
north west of santiago 
several rightwing politicians and parties have also indicated 
they would like pinochet to run but the valparaiso group is the 
first one especially organized to promote his candidacy 
the 1980 constitution bars pinochet from seeking reelection but 
in recent weeks the growing divisions among rightwing forces 
prompted calls to find a way for him to run in the dec 14 election 
the election was made mandatory by an oct 5 referendum in which 
voters overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal to extend 
pinochets term until 1997 
supporters of a pinochet candidacy say the constitution may be 
changed to allow him to run and the generals wife lucia hiriart 
publicly supported such a constitutional amendment 
others say the constitutional restriction on reelection does not 
apply to the 73yearold president and army commander because he was 
not elected in the first place pinochet seized power in a bloody 
1973 coup 
the government announced last week that it is considering a 
plebiscite as early as june to approve unspecified constitutional 
changes there has been no indication however that the changes 
would include one to allow pinochet to run in december 
pablo rodriguez one of two rightwing politicians who have 
formally announced their presidential candidacies says he would 
only withdraw from the race if pinochet can run 
pinochet has admitted he cannot be a candidate under the present 
constitutional terms he told his supporters however that he will 
tell them who to support in the presidential race

jubilant icelanders quaffed legal lager 
for the first time in 74 years wednesday when prohibition laws 
banning the sale of fullstrength beer officially ended 
lines formed outside some of the 17 state liquor stores that hold 
the monopoly on selling spirits when the doors swung open at the 
snorra braut branch in central reykjavik there were cheers and 
applause 
two new pubs timed their opening day to coincide with bday 
and many restaurants and bars reported their tables were booked up 
weeks in advance by icelanders planning to celebrate their new 
freedom 
in one new pub in reykjavik the beer cellar a bell was rung at 
noon and customers were asked to observe a moment of silence before 
taking a gulp 
alcoholic drinks became illegal in iceland in 1915 following a 
referendum and although prohibition was repealed in 1933 beer 
containing more than 225 percent alcohol remained outlawed 
the weak beer never gained popularity and icelanders who wanted 
to imbibe legally often resorted to the national drink called the 
black death a mindnumbing clear liquid that is 40 percent alcohol 
and tastes like vodka 
parliament finally passed a law legalizing beer in may and gave 
the island nation of 251000 until march 1 to prepare for the change 
that ended icelands isolation from its aleloving scandinavian 
neighbors 
after the moment of silence at the beer cellar on wednesday 
magnus sveinsson president of the reykjavik city council cut a 
ribbon and enjoyed the first glass of locally brewed suds each 
customer got a free glass of beer no mean feat considering that 
bars are charging 390 to 480 a glass 
this is indeed a world event sveinsson joked to the cameras 
adding i am convinced icelanders will learn to handle beer 
seeing as icelanders have always been open to foreign cultural 
influences 
he urged people to take buses home citing lines from i think 
ill walk home a song by pop star valgeir gudjonsson against 
drunken driving 
the song commissioned by the state board of alcoholism 
prevention was been played incessantly on radio and tv before 
bday 
newspapers have carried ads warning that beer is alcohol 
just in case any icelanders have forgotten after 74 years 
in parliament a few days ago education minister svavar gestsson 
accused the media of hyping the occasion he said all efforts to 
educate the public about the evils of drink have proved in vain 
against this terrible flood 
police said they were on heightened alert for drunken drivers 
iceland prides itself on having relatively low alcohol 
consumption but intake has jumped from an annual 67 pints per head 
in 1981 to 945 pints now 
the state which controls the liquor supply is exacting hefty 
levies on beer a 24can case of imported beer costs about 5760 
the price was expected to be even higher but the government 
decided it should not outprice hard liquor before legalization 
smuggled beer fetched about 70 for a 24can case 
beer of above 56percent alcoholic content remains banned and 
pleading lack of storage space the government has also restricted 
the number of importers to three budweiser of the united states 
tuborg of denmark and kaiser of austria two local breweries are 
providing another four brands 
beer was completely outlawed until 1980 when the law changed to 
allow icelanders arriving from abroad to bring in 122 pints of 
foreign beer

in the interest of medical science 12 men 
have volunteered to dine on salmon every day for 40 days stroll 
through one of the most beautiful areas of the city twice daily and 
get paid for their trouble 
the arrangment is part of a 100day dietary study conducted by 
the federal government to determine possible beneficial effects of 
fish oil consumption participants and researchers gathered 
wednesday to publicize the study and generate interest in similar 
research 
entrees will include broiled salmon with dill salmon pate on 
bagels salmon lasagna and salmon teriyaki 
if the assignment which began with breakfast tuesday makes your 
mouth water youre not alone more than 2000 prospective 
volunteers applied for the 12 slots a public service announcement 
recruiting volunteers generated worldwide interest and media 
attention 
but the 100day stint has its drawbacks participants are 
confined to the dormitorystyle metabolic unit of the letterman 
army institute of research at the presidio constantly under the 
surveillance of staff they are allowed only two hours a week to 
visit with family and friends 
their diets are strictly controlled every bite is monitored the 
only unlimited substance is water and even that is tabulated daily 
partipants not only clean their plates they must scrape them 
squeaky clean along with forks and knives rubber spatulas are 
provided with each meal 
this is really a scientific study said rodger obrien 54 
of san jose they weigh everything going in and everything going 
out 
on the first day one participant drank the required glass of 
milk and sent his colorcoded tray back to the kitchen he thought 
he was done not so supervisors said handing him a spatula and 
requesting that he squeegee out the last drops of milk 
clean your plate takes on a new meaning said project manager 
ed blonz 
but so far the food is drawing rave reviews and salmon wont be 
on the menu for 18 days yet the first 20 days are spent 
establishing what researchers call a stabilization diet of 
balanced lowfat meals with no fish 
the food is excellent obrien said any one of these 
meals if you bought it in a restaurant youd pay some bucks for 
it 
researchers hope that by feeding participants a diet rich in fish 
oils they will be able to determine the purported beneficial 
effects of omega3 or polyunsaturated fatty acids 
unlike studies in which participants consume massive doses of 
fish oil in capsules research chemist gary j nelson said this 
project seeks to replicate a diet people could eat at home 
previous research suggests that fish oils may be beneficial in 
the treatment or prevention of heart disease cancer and other 
ailments as well as in improving the bodys immune system 
you name it and somebody has claimed it nelson said 
salmon was selected for its relatively high fat content some 
fish like dover sole is only about 1 percent fat compared to 
salmon which is 10 percent fat 
and it tastes good 
late this month volunteers will dig in to their first helping of 
king salmon salmon entrees served twicedaily will provide each 
participant with about 25 times the amount of fish oil as the 
average american 
their daily regimen includes two 2mile walks around the army 
base each day the wakeup call is 630 am and lights must be out 
at midnight volunteers share starklyfurnished double rooms as 
well as a library quiet room and day room complete with 
stereo vcr and pool table 
im thinking about getting a pool tournament together said 
robert trujillo 31 a selfemployed market researcher who lives in 
los gatos another guy is a carpenter and is going to be working 
on projects for his home 
trujillo said he has always had an interest in scientific 
research and figured this way he could contribute something to 
science without being dead

the air force continuing a selective 
relaxation of the security shrouding its newest weapons released a 
photograph wednesday providing a limited view of its new stealth 
cruise missile 
the blackandwhite photo shows a b52 bomber flying with four of 
the new missiles tucked under each wing 
the picture shows the missile has flattened sides instead of a 
perfectly rounded shape that the engine air inlet is cut into the 
top of the missile instead of sticking up on a pylon from the 
fuselage and the wings and tail fins are folded up against the 
missile body until it is fired 
but the angle from which the photograph was taken does not allow 
any other details of the weapons design to be discerned and the 
air force said wednesday it is not prepared to say more 
production schedules budget figures and tentative dates for 
fielding all remain classified said lt col rick oborn a pentagon 
spokesman 
the release of the photo of the stealth cruise known formally as 
the advanced cruise missile or agm129a is the third such move in 
10 months last april the air force released an artists sketch 
that revealed the flying wing design of the new b2 stealth 
bomber 
then last november the service released a photograph albeit a 
poor one of the supersecret f117a stealth jet fighter 
wednesdays release appeared to be tied in part to an upcoming 
test of the new missile over canada the united states and canada 
announced feb 1 that canada had agreed to let the air force test 
the advanced cruise missile in arctic conditions 
according to air force officials who asked not to be named the 
first such test was scheduled wednesday but had to be postponed due 
to weather conditions 
the standard cruise missile is a jetpowered flying bomb that 
looks like a torpedo with stubby wings and a tail fin the missile 
carries a sophisticated guidance system that allows it to hug the 
ground to escape detection 
the stealth version of the cruise missile is supposed to be even 
more impervious to detection while also offering greater range 
the term stealth is applied to a variety of techniques used to 
foil radar by employing unusual aircraft designs and new types of 
manufacturing materials a plane or missile can absorb or deflect 
radar signals without bouncing them back to an enemy tracking system 
although most of the publicity about stealth technology has 
centered on the b2 bomber the general dynamics corp has been 
under contract since 1983 to develop and build a stealth version of 
the standard cruise missile 
the mcdonnell douglas corp received a separate contract in 1987 
to become a second producer of the missile 
congressional officials disclosed almost two years ago in april 
1987 the stealth missile program was suffering from serious 
production quality problems and cost overruns although denied by 
the air force the washington post has quoted sources as saying the 
program is three years behind schedule and will cost 7 billion 
instead of 5 billion 
acting air force secretary james f mcgovern in a written 
statement released wednesday with the picture said the stealth 
cruise missile will improve the longterm effectiveness of the 
bomber leg of the nuclear triad 
incorporation of advances in propulsion and guidance 
technology along with lowobservable stealth design features 
results in a system with improvements in range accuracy and 
flexibility

a mother who fought the state so she 
could bring her terminally ill 3yearold daughter home to die 
learned of her victory in the custody battle just five minutes 
before the girl died in a hospital 
it was a very hollow victory said sara rahdert an attorney 
who helped cheryl dutchak win back little candice 
mrs dutchak fought for eight months to regain custody of her 
daughter a judge in clearwater signed the order monday and ms 
rahdert rushed it to the childs room at all childrens hospital in 
st petersburg about 25 miles away 
the mother read the order aloud the hospital began preparations 
to discharge the baby 
five minutes later candice died 
it was almost like she was waiting for me to hand that order to 
her parents ms rahdert said i know that sounds strange but 
that was what it was lie 
candice suffered health problems from birth caused by a loss of 
amniotic fluid during her mothers pregnancy doctors had 
recommended abortion because the baby might not live complications 
kept her in the hospital for two months she lost her right leg at 
the knee because of circulation problems and she had failing kidneys 
last march candice suffered brain damage after a seizure doctors 
said the seizure occurred when mrs dutchak withheld medication at 
home mrs dutchak said an emergency room doctor told her to 
withhold the medication 
in april the florida department of health and rehablitative 
services charged mrs dutchak with child abuse and took the girl 
away the child abuse charge was dropped but the state retained 
custody until monday 
in september hrs agreed to a compromise if mrs dutchak proved 
she was a fit mother candice could go home 
the mother did what the state asked but it wasnt enough ms 
rahdert said earlier this month hrs officials asked a judge to add 
a few more requirements before mrs dutchak could take candice home 
then candices condition worsened on monday doctors called mrs 
dutchak and said she was likely to die soon mrs dutchak called her 
lawyer who sought an emergency custody order but hrs district 
administrator michael becker agreed for humanitarian reasons to 
release the girl to her mother according to hrs spokeswoman elaine 
fultonjones 
circuit judge jack page signed the order transferring custody 
about 1245 pm the attorney said 
i dashed from the courthouse to the hospital cheryl 
read the order out loud stating that they did get custody back 
ms rahdert said about five minutes after mom read this order out 
loud to everyone in the room including the child the child died

i think we have to continually seek to find better ways to 
effectively utilize the military 
we should not be engaged in the business of perhaps sometimes 
degrading our military roles and missions in an ineffective 
interdiction job of drugs 
i cant claim any expertise in that area now 
its a matter that i will have to get into and get into in some 
depth once im confirmed 
q theres been some suggestion that the accusations against you 
have been fueled by the pentagon itself because of its fear and 
concern about the reforms you would make any comments 
a if thats true i would consider that to be a very very 
strong recommendation for my confirmation laughter 
q several hundred men and women are ousted each year from the 
armed aervices because they are homosexuals how would you would 
you favor the creation of a panel to study whether the militarys 
ban should be ended 
a well my visceral reaction is that it should not be but its a 
matter on which i havent done quite frankly have not done much 
thinking nor paid close attention to 
im sure it is a matter that will come to my early attention and 
that i will have to deal with it 
i am not prepared to do so right now 
q if confirmed what effect will all the debate leading up to 
the vote have on your ability to function as secretary of defense 
a i have been assured by my potential subordinates that it would 
have no adverse effect on them in terms of following my direction 
and my authority 
i think when people suggest that i would be incapable or crippled 
or in some way debilitated in the performance of my duty to explain 
how they think i would be 
i think once youre given that authority backed up by the 
president of the united states and youre engaged in the active 
cooperation of congress that my effectiveness would not be 
diminished 
and two there is a very clear perception in the military 
community that i am being very very unfairly treated and my 
confirmation would be considered vindication 
and i think to survive the kind of campaign that i have been 
through actually indicates strength and not weakness 
q senator could you tell us what specific defense or national 
security programs are being delayed pending your confirmation

nearly 90 percent of young west 
germans believe the soviet bloc is not a military threat and most 
want their country to cut defense spending according to a poll 
released wednesday 
the survey commissioned by zdf television appeared to be yet 
another sign of the positive attitude many germans are developing 
toward the kremlin especially toward soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and his promise to withdraw troops from europe 
zdf said the independent forschungsgruppe wahlen research company 
surveyed 825 west germans between 16 and 29 years old the network 
did not provide a margin of error for the poll which was conducted 
from feb 17 to feb 23 
the poll said 87 percent do not feel militarily threatened by the 
warsaw pact and 78 percent believe their nation should cut defense 
spending which has an annual level of about 30 billion 
the results of the poll were described during a zdf program 
wednesday night on the armed forces and provided in advance to the 
associated press 
public opinion polls last year repeatedly said gorbachevs 
popularity far outstripped that of thenpresident reagan 
many west germans have come to regard the cold war as being 
nearly over recent polls indicate in addition many appear smitten 
with the gorbymania orchestrated by the increasingly 
imageconscious kremlin 
they also responded positively to gorbachevs pledge earlier this 
year to unilaterally cut armed forces by 500000 troops in two 
years including a reduction of 240000 soldiers in the european 
theater 
gorbachev also said the production of arms and military supplies 
would be slashed by 195 percent and 10000 tanks would be 
eliminated in europe 
the perception that the soviet threat is diminishing has led to 
growing questions about the need for us military training flights 
in west germany and the routine maneuvers that chew up farmers 
fields and disrupt daily life 
a key issue for the federal government in bonn is whether to 
replace the approximately 600 aging lance nuclear missiles stationed 
in west germany 
chancellor helmut kohls government wants the decision delayed 
until 1991 or 1992 to keep it from becoming an issue in next years 
general elections

dr louis sullivan took his place at the helm 
of the largest federal department wednesday after the senate 
approved his nomination 981 one senator called the new health and 
human services secretary a compassionate professional 
the lone vote against sullivan was cast by sen jesse helms 
rnc who criticized the atlanta doctor for declining to take a 
position on several abortionrelated issues including research on 
fetal tissue 
in other confirmation action wednesday 
the senate voted 990 to approve retired adm james d watkins 
as the first career military man to head the department of energy 
which devotes twothirds of its budget to developing building and 
testing the nations nuclear arsenal at a network of 15 major plants 
in a dozen states 
watkins 61 who retired in 1986 after 41 years in the navy 
encountered no opposition during the confirmation process and was 
widely praised on capitol hill as a fit choice for guiding the 
energy department at a time of growing controversy over the 
condition of its nuclear weapons complex 
edward j derwinski nominated to head the new veterans 
department told his confirmation hearing he still doesnt believe 
he endangered anyone 12 years ago with an unthinking warning to the 
korean embassy that one of their agents was about to defect to the 
united states 
in initial questioning by the veterans affairs committee no 
senator criticized his action in the korean matter but chairman 
alan cranston dcalif said i do not intend to take a position 
until the vote tomorrow 
william j bennett nominated to lead the fight against drug 
abuse told his confirmation hearing that a wellfashioned strategy 
can ease the problem but that it will not disappear overnight 
bennett appeared a virtual shooin for endorsement by the 
judiciary committee with his sharpest critic sen paul simon 
dill saying he was considering voting against the nomination but 
that he hadnt made up his mind 
sullivan a 55yearold blood specialist was roundly praised by 
democrats and republicans alike for his commitment to the 
healthcare needs of the poor demonstrated by his founding of the 
morehouse school of medicine in atlanta to train physicians to work 
in medically underserved areas 
im confident that dr sullivan is going to be a caring 
advocate for these millions of americans said sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas 
sen orrin hatch rutah said the task of administering a 
department with a nearly 400 billion budget and 114000 employees 
must fall on the shoulders of a compassionate professional i 
believe that dr sullivan is such a person 
the issue of abortion has been the most controversial for 
sullivan since his remarks in the atlanta journal constitution that 
he supported abortion and to sen bob packwood rore that he 
favored retaining the supreme courts roe vs wade decision 
legalizing the procedure 
at his confirmation hearing before the senate finance committee 
sullivan apologized to packwood for having misspoken his 
position and said he holds the same views on the subject as the 
president he is opposed to abortion except in cases of rape incest 
or danger to the mothers life he opposes federal financing of 
abortions except when the mothers life is threatened and he favors 
reversal of roe vs wade 
packwood who is strongly prochoice said he disagreed with 
sullivans stand on abortion but he said the issue has gotten undue 
attention considering that the department of health and human 
services has few abortionrelated activities 
in every sense this man is qualified to do a first rate job 
the issue of abortion ought to be irrelevant packwood said 
several senators said that while they admired sullivans attempt 
to avoid any conflicts of interest by forfeiting nearly 300000 in 
severance pay from his job as president of morehouse the sacrifice 
wasnt necessary and could discourage others from taking government 
jobs

two federal agencies on wednesday proposed to 
help fight aids among heroin addicts by allowing interim methadone 
treatment in cities where comprehensive treatment programs have 
waiting lists 
the plan to be published in thursdays federal register was 
proposed by the food and drug administration and the national 
institute on drug abuse to make methadone treatments available to 
more addicts sooner and reduce exposure to aids through 
needlesharing 
also thursday final rules will go into effect to streamline 
regulations governing methadone treatment programs and make other 
changes including elimination of the counselorpatient ratio at 
treatment clinics previously programs had to have one counselor for 
every 50 patients 
intravenous heroin addicts often share needles and in doing so 
become infected with the virus that causes the deadly disease 
methadone which is used to help relieve an addicts craving for 
heroin is taken by mouth which eliminates the risk from needles 
although methadone is best used as part of a comprehensive 
treatment program that includes counseling and other vocational and 
rehabilitative services many clinics have waiting lists of six 
months or more the agencies said 
about 500000 of the estimated 12 million intravenous drug 
abusers in the country are heroin addicts and three out of four 
cities with methadone treatment clinics have waiting lists the 
institute said 
under the proposal heroin addicts would be able to receive 
methadone treatment seven days a week at outpatient clinics and 
from mobile medical units but the drug would not be provided for 
takehome use participants would be counseled on avoiding acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
the proposal is based on a pilot program at beth israel medical 
center in new york which appears to have reduced the use of 
needles the two agencies said

a i dont know of any that are being delayed 
were in the process now of trying to come up with the revised 
budget based on the budgetary constraints of a zero budget for 
fiscal year 1990 
and thats ongoing right now and the numbers crunchers are hard 
at work 
q it appears that the soviets must reduce their huge military 
expenditures if gorbachevs perestroika is to succeed in that 
event is this any time for the united states and nato to make 
unilateral reductions in defense expenditures 
a i think unilateral reductions would be dangerous in the 
extreme 
we must not 
we must continue to modernize and improve our forces 
we cannot engage in a euphemistic orgy of neglect of our defense 
establishments throughout nato and the united states 
the fact is if perestroika succeeds what will emerge will be a 
much stronger soviet union 
that omens well for the future if it is a more benign soviet 
union one that is not so bent on selfaggrandizement a soviet 
union that is prepared to live in peace and harmony with its 
neighbors 
that will be of course a very happy outcome 
and then perhaps we can begin the business of beating swords 
into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks 
but it is altogether possible that what could emerge from a 
successful reform effort that strengthens the soviet economy would 
be a further emboldened soviet union ever more threatening and ever 
more ominous 
we must be prepared for either outcome 
q in the event that you do not win confirmation will you return 
to consulting for defense contractors 
a i have no intention of ever returning to defense consulting 
again in any circumstance 
following my career in government service should it extend over 
a period of a few years from now or should it extend over a much 
shorter period of time it is my expectation that my involvement in 
national security matters will be in the academic world primarily 
my involvement in defense matters 
in all probability if once i well i wont say in 
probability id say its a virtual certainty that once i complete 
my public service ive spent virtually all of my adult life in 
public service only two a little over two years two and a half 
years in the private sector and thats all the rest of it has been 
given over to public service 
ive accumulated very little in this world being a school 
teacher by background or by trade and a clergymans son by 
background 
and i remember what john nance garner once said when he left the 
vice presidency after having served as speaker of the house vice 
president of the united states a distinguished career he said he 
was going to cross that potomac heading west and never return again 
he never came back and he lived to be 95 years old laughter 
however i will not make that kind of flat commitment 
it is my plan to load up my 1972 dodge charger 400 magnum with 
all my possessions mattress strapped to the roof and all that sort 
of thing and head back to texas to as my permanent residence 
but i might be back from time to time in one capacity or another 
incidentally in that my grandparents lived into their 90s my 
enemies can take small comfort that i will depart this world anytime 
soon laughter 
q representative aspins plan to fund all strategic programs at 
31 billion over a 10year period has been proposed is this the 
type of proposal that ought to be coming from a secretary of 
defense

firefighters nationwide need a better system 
for notifying them of hazardous materials so they can prevent 
accidents such as the one that killed six kansas city mo firemen 
last year a house panel was told wednesday 
they had no warning that the fire they were trying to 
extinguish was a time bomb waiting to take their lives said terry 
conroy president of the kansas city chapter of the international 
association of firefighters 
at a hearing before a house government operations subcommittee 
conroy other firefighting officials and several members of congress 
said that accident pointed to the need for tighter and more 
coordinated regulation of hazardous materials as well as improved 
training for firemen 
the kansas city firefighters were killed when a trailer loaded 
with tons of blasting agent exploded at a highway construction site 
nov 29 lawmakers were told that a dispatcher warned the 
firefighters that explosives might be in the area but was unable to 
provide the specific location or the type of hazardous material 
involved 
most of the criticism was directed at the regulatory system 
spread among a host of federal agencies as well as state and local 
governments 
current laws have created tremendous duplication and confusion 
and at the same time leave gaping voids said john eversole 
commander of the chicago fire departments hazardous incident team 
lawmakers were told that current righttoknow laws were 
inadequate and that many companies do not comply with requirements 
to report chemicals and other hazardous materials to fire 
departments and other emergency planning agencies 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the employment and housing 
subcommittee suggested that congress consider criminal penalties 
for those failing to report hazardous materials 
rep alan wheat dmo complained that the blasting agent in the 
kansas city accident was not on an environmental protection agency 
list of materials that must be reported to firefighters jim makris 
an epa official said the agency would consider adding it to the 
reporting requirement

a retired general testified at oliver norths 
trial wednesday that he and north decided in 1985 to assume the 
worst that norths actions were covered by a law forbidding 
official aid to the nicaraguan contras and to act accordingly 
earlier in the day however robert owen testified that he made 
many trips between washington and central america for north 
carrying instructions from the presidential aide for how the 
guerrilla war was to be fought and carrying maps and money 
owen said north told him he acted with the knowledge and approval 
of superiors the courier testified at one point that north said he 
had president reagans approval but he said later that testimony 
was wrong that north never got more specific than superiors 
retired maj gen john k singlaub an ardent anticommunist who 
directed spy activities in three wars also testified he persuaded 
taiwan and another asian nation with norths knowledge to give 
5 million each to the nicaraguan contras but the plan failed for 
lack of a required signal from the us government 
at the time the reagan administration was under a 
congressimposed ban the boland amendment against helping the 
rebels conducting a guerrilla war against the nicaraguan government 
the second asian country was not identified 
singlaub said he proposed to north in december 1984 to solicit 
funds in the far east from singlaubs close personal friends at 
high levels sympathetic to the cause 
i explained that the policy of the united states was quite 
clear to support the nicaraguan resistance and that congress 
temporary action stopped us he testified 
singlaub who will return to the witness stand thursday was the 
fourth witness in the trial which resumed despite serious 
stillunresolved national security issues that had halted testimony 
for nearly two days 
defense lawyer brendan sullivan has renewed a motion to declare 
that a federal law designed to protect state secrets from being 
spilled in the courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the north 
case sullivan also has asked that the 12 criminal charges against 
north be thrown out 
on wednesday the government replied that the process of handling 
classified material in court is not as north contends a reason 
to conclude that the trial is unworkable 
while norths trial continues one of the key figures who will 
testify for the prosecution former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane is to be sentenced friday by us district judge aubrey 
robinson he pleaded guilty a year ago to four misdemeanors 
involving withholding information from congress about norths 
activities 
north is accused of lying to congress about his activities on 
behalf of the nicaraguan contras activities in which both he and 
singlaub were deeply involved in the 19841986 period when the 
boland amendment banned such aid 
i argued that it could not possibly apply to the office of the 
president singlaub said north then a marine lieutenant colonel 
was assigned to the presidents national security council 
colonel north said he agreed but could not get consensus 
some said it did apply some said it did not singlaub said they 
agreed that the best thing was to assume the worst that it did 
apply 
singlaub said they worked out an arrangement under which he would 
work with rebel leader adolfo calero and keep north informed 
owen at one point in his testimony said north told him that 
everything he was doing was with the presidents knowledge but he 
later said he misspoke and that north only referred to orders 
from superiors 
colonel north never said anything about the presidents 
knowledge owen said under questioning by assistant prosecutor 
david zornow 
q did he ever tell you the president of the united states told 
him to lie 
a no sir 
q did he ever tell you the president of the united states told 
him to conceal what he was doing 
a no sir 
further said owen north never invoked the names of the national 
security advisers he worked under mcfarlane and adm john 
poindexter 
norths defense is that he had authorization from superiors for 
everything he did 
owen also said he met with at least half a dozen cia agents in 
central american countries to discuss supply efforts to the contras 
the agents were referred to in the courtroom by number 
singlaub testifying about his efforts to get foreign funds said 
he was going to try a second time to get the asian money for the 
contras got assurance from thenassistant secretary of state 
elliott abrams that a signal would be given then was telephoned by 
abrams and told to call off the effort 
singlaub also testified that in march 1985 he went to honduras 
and met with nicaraguan rebel leaders and base commanders and 
returned to give north a priority list of items that contra 
commander enrique bermudez suggested 
calero put 5 million into an account in europe and the weapons 
were bought and arrived in central america by ship in 1985 singlaub 
said 
in august 1986 days before the house intelligence committee had 
a facetoface meeting with north to ask about his activities 
singlaub said he offered a new list of weapons prices to north who 
told him he was no longer in the business and to send them to 
the cia 
singlaub said he wrote to cia director william casey his world 
war ii boss in the office of strategic services the cias 
forerunner and said the list was developed in conjunction with a 
member of the nsc who is knowledgeable of the urgent need of the 
contras 
later he saw casey who threatened to throw me out of his office 
if i discussed the subject of nicaragua in his presence i told him 
i would keep north informed he indicated that was the proper 
place

bureau in jerusalem afp reporters said

according to rahmeh the caller said his group the palestinian 
arab army would release the soldier if israel agreed to a series of

there have been allegations that israel was responsible for the 
assassination but israel never has publicly admitted involvement

a id rather not comment on any proposals emanating from 
congress right now laughter 
it reminds me of the story about paddy oleary who was on his 
deathbed very ill in extremis and a priest was summoned to his 
side 
and the priest leaned over him and said paddy do you renounce 
the devil and all his works 
and paddy looked up at the priest and said father im in no 
condition now to make any enemies laughter applause 
q a recent abc poll indicated that the american people believe 
that you should not have been nominated but since you have been 
that president bushs choice should be supported does the senate 
run a risk if it votes against your votes against public opinion 
a i have never been one i would be hypocritical if i said 
otherwise 
ive never been one that believes that the congress should simply 
follow polling results because it is incumbent on members of 
congress to lead and to help shape public opinion not simply 
blindly follow a popular whim of the moment 
so i think senators should make up their mind based on their own 
personal convictions their own knowledge and understanding of the 
issues at hand 
q senator before asking my last question id like to present 
you with a certificate of appreciation from the national press club 
and id also like to present you with a press club paperweight the 
my last question and i must say that youve taken the wind out 
of my sails a little bit i know that upon retirement you had said 
before that youd like to be a linebacker coach for tom landry 
laughter now what laughter 
a well just like i thought the alamo analogy was unfortunate i 
think the landry analogy is unfortunate as well laughter 
i didnt say defensive line coach for landry i simply said for 
the i really said for the smu mustangs 
they havent had a football team for the last two years because 
of some rather shortsighted and unfair judgments rendered by the 
ncaa laughter 
but i dont think i could do that on a professional level 
i might apply at southern methodist university for that job 
which i understand is open now applause

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
wednesday that cancercausing aflatoxin is unlikely to get into the 
food supply in amounts great enough to hurt anyone 
anytime we have a drought we are going to see more aflatoxin 
problems yeutter told the house appropriations subcommittee on 
rural development agriculture and related agencies that doesnt 
mean were going to have more in the food supply or any that 
slips in is going to hurt anyone 
yeutter criticized a recent article in the wall street journal 
that said aflatoxintainted corn is moving through the nations food 
chain because of inadequate sampling and unreliable testing 
he said the article implied that people are being cavalier about 
the existence of the toxin 
everyone is going to do their best to minimize the risk of 
letting aflatoxin into the food supply he said nobody in the 
food chain wants it 
last years heat and drought were ideal for development of the 
fungus that produces aflatoxin which researchers have linked to the 
development of liver cancer in laboratory rats 
the level of aflatoxin allowed in corn is 20 parts per billion 
on tuesday the food and drug administration said about 6 percent 
95 samples out of 1650 of the field corn tested in recent 
months had higher levels 
that corn cannot be used for human consumption but can be 
diverted to feed nondairy cattle the fda said 
fda tested about 263 samples of corn flour and corn meal and 
found 2 percent or six samples to have more than 20 parts of 
aflatoxin per billion fda policy requires that these products be 
removed from the market 
in answer to another question from the subcommittee yeutter said 
he considers the chance of international trade reform to be better 
than it has been in a decade 
he said that there are some hurdles the united states and the 
european community must work out before talks in the uruguay round 
resume next month in geneva 
im cautiously optimistic well get that worked out between now 
and april he told the committee 
what happens in the uruguay round will determine what we should 
have in farm legislation yeutter said 
he said he doesnt anticipate any significant changes from the 
1985 farm bill that is due to expire in 1990 he said congress could 
extend the 1985 law until the uruguay talks are complete or pass a 
new bill and amend it as necessary after the negotiations

record inflation by cutting subsidies on basic foods and 
transportation 
consumer prices rose 425 percent in february the national 
statistics institute reported wednesday despite the austerity plan 
launched feb 1 
the measures wednesday included a devaluation of 233 percent 
bringing the value of the official peruvian currency the inti from 
920 to 1200 to the dollar

employees and nonunionized private workers rose a similar 
percentage 
analysts say perus working class and poor have been hit hardest 
by rocketing inflation which ran a record 1722 percent last year 
as a result of subsidyfueled deficit spending under president alan 
garcia and a dramatic shrinkage of the economy last year estimated 
at 84 percent 
venezuelas subsidycutting plan that raised prices on gasoline 
prices and bus tickets this week set off widespread rioting that 
left at least 100 dead 
garcias administration has acknowledged inflation will continue 
to grow in the short term due to the price and wage increases but 
eventually decline with a decrease in government spending for 
subsidies 
the national statistics institute said inflation so far this year 
has reached 1099 percent consumer prices rose 473 percent in 
january 
prior to the program of austerity installments which concludes 
in may the government over the past year has been steadily cutting 
back on the types of products its subsidizes 
now most imported products now must be purchased at the floating 
free market exchange rate which was 1300 intis to the dollar and 
unchanged by wednesdays measures

guatemalan president vinicio cerezo meeting 
wednesday with vice president dan quayle said leftistruled 
nicaragua should start democratic reforms before a final agreement 
to disband the contra rebels 
cerezo told reporters after his halfhour session with quayle 
that the us officials still have reservations about the peace 
agreement reached two weeks ago by the five central american 
presidents 
cerezos session with quayle and a similar meeting scheduled 
thursday with president bush offered an opportunity to voice us 
concerns about nicaraguas intentions in the agreement us 
officials said 
a chief complaint expressed by bush administration officials is 
lack of an enforcement mechanism to ensure the ruling sandinistas in 
nicaragua live up to promised reforms 
quayle emphasized that concern wednesday and bush is expected to 
make the same point administration officials said 
previous us policy held that the usbacked contras provided 
the goad which could push the sandinistas into democratization 
one major roadblock to a nicaraguan peace plan has been an 
inability to agree on whether disarmament of the contras of internal 
reforms in nicaragua should come first 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega pledged in the agreement last 
month to free political prisoners hold early elections allow 
opposition parties access to the media and repatriate the contras 
but there was no timetable for those reforms and the five 
presidents said they would agree on those details within 90 days 
cerezo asked wednesday when the sandinistas should implement

president bush drew on his recent asian trip to 
make a new pitch for lower capital gains taxes wednesday claiming 
western pacific businesses enjoy a competitive tax advantage over 
us companies 
the four dragons of hong kong singapore taiwan and south 
korea all exempt longterm capital gains from tax total exemption 
japan also had no tax on capital gains during its meteoric rise to 
economic power bush told a business group at the white house 
in his 1989 budget bush proposed that the tax on capital gains 
be lowered to a maximum of 15 percent from its current rate of 28 
percent or in some cases 33 percent 
while i was in asia this recent trip i had a chance to think 
seriously about what sets our trading partners apart from us and i 
realized that we may have erected a barrier to our own success and 
deprived ourselves of vital longterm investment that our 
competitors have always enjoyed bush said 
he returned monday from a fiveday trip to japan china and south 
korea 
speaking to about 250 members of the small business legislative 
council in the east room bush said by taxing capital gains we 
impede our own progress and we turn the playing field into an uphill 
climb 
bush claims that lowering the tax on capital gains profits from 
the sale of stock real estate works of art or other assets will 
spur business investment reaping for the treasury more than it 
costs 
however the idea has generated fierce opposition in the 
democraticcontrolled congress where leaders have sought to portray 
it as a new tax break for the rich 
bush on wednesday insisted the tax break will increase revenues 
48 billion annually 
private economists are divided on whether lowering capital gains 
taxes would increase or decrease revenues 
while in seoul bush cautioned the south korean national assembly 
to do more in opening markets and avoiding protectionism 
he made reference to that in wednesdays address claiming he had 
stressed to asian trading partners at every stopthe need for 
keeping these markets open

secretary of state james a baker iii told 
congress on wednesday that the international war on illegal drugs 
is clearly not being won and might even be slipping 
backwards 
the assessment was in the annual presidential report on global 
drug trafficking which baker sent to capitol hill 
the wideranging report which singled out the new government in 
mexico for some praise listed 17 countries or territories as major 
illegal drug producers or transit points yet found their 
governments to be helping in the us drug battle 
the presidents action known formally as certification 
means those nations will not lose us military or economic aid or 
become ineligible for loans and other trade preferences 
at the same time bush recommended that burma and laos be added 
to the list of nations ineligible for us aid because of their 
support for drug trafficking 
that step however is virtually meaningless since neither 
nation or the others in the same list afghanistan iran syria 
and panama receives any us aid the action however does permit 
the government to impose tariffs or tighten custom rules against 
certain imports 
the study is expected to spark controversy on capitol hill 
because of its treatment of mexico and several other nations known 
to be major drug exporters or transit points 
last year the senate voted 6327 to punish mexico for its lack 
of cooperation in the battle against drugs but the house killed a 
similar measure this year congress has 45 days to decide whether 
it agrees with the presidents findings 
the most striking language came in the dim view taken by baker of 
the international battle against illicit drugs 
the secretary said he and the president are both deeply 
troubled by the state of affairs both here and abroad the 
international war on narcotics is clearly not being won in fact in 
some areas we appear to be slipping backwards 
ann wrobleski assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters said bakers grim assessment was based on the 
worldwide increases in marijuana opium and coca production as well 
as a worldwide increase in drug abuse 
these twin increases fuel an increase in power of drug 
trafficking cartels and that worries us said ms wrobleski who 
discussed the report with journalists 
in his letter accompanying the report baker pledged that the 
battle against illegal drugs will remain a key element of our 
foreign policy agenda and that both he and bush will raise this 
issue with foreign leaders in the effort to reduce the supply of 
drugs bound for the united states 
under law the president is required to certify by march 1 that 
countries where major drug trafficking occurs are fully 
cooperating with the us effort to stem the drug trade 
baker noted that of the 17 countries found to be cooperating with 
the united states six can and must do more in the future to end 
the drug trade 
the include 
the bahamas which was praised for a combined law enforcement 
operation with the united states but was cited for possible 
government corruption and urged to make stronger unilateral 
efforts to curb drug trafficking and consumption 
bolivia which was lauded for a good effort with its coca 
eradication program the administration expressed concern however 
that more must be done 
colombia which was praised for strong action against 
cocaine refining and resistance to violent drug traffickers it was 
noted however that the judiciary remains intimidated by the 
drug traffickers and little prospect for their arrest exists 
mexico which was cited for president carlos salinas strong 
public stance against drugs as well as the efforts of his new 
deputy attorney general but corruption was seen as a continuing 
problem and the nation remains the united states top source for 
heroin and its no 2 source for marijuana 
paraguay which was praised for a stronger commitment in 
1988 but was still termed a significant drug transit point and 
moneylaundering center former gen alfredo stroessner was ousted 
by a military coup in february although reports have surfaced that 
the new president andres rodriguez has links to the 
drugtrafficking industry the list says the department does not 
yet know what type of actions will be taken by his government 
peru which was lauded for some real progress in antidrug 
programs but was urged to adopt an even stronger crop control 
effort

a group of governors and former governors urged 
the bush adminstration wednesday to propose acid rain legislation 
that would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by at least 10 million 
tons by the end of this century 
such emission reductions are needed for the legislation to be 
taken serously in the acid rain debate gov rudy perpich of 
minnesota one of the meeting participants told a news conference 
perpich is the new chairman of the alliance for acid rain 
control a coalition of governors industry representatives and 
environmentalists working toward reducing acid rain which is caused 
largely by industrial pollution and emissions from coalburning 
power plants 
but perpich and anthony earl former governor of wisconsin said 
the meeting with richard k reilly head of the environmental 
protection agency produced no firm commitment from reilly on 
specific pollution reductions the administration might seek 
nevertheless said perpich we are optimistic that this is the 
year for acid rain legislation and an end to years of acrimony 
and deadlock on this issue 
president bush has said that one of his top environmental 
priorities is to submit to congress legislation aimed at reducing 
the industrial and other pollutants that cause acid rain 
congressional leaders have said they expect to vote on an acid rain 
bill by summer 
but some of the governors expressed concern that federal 
legislation might punish states that already have taken aggressive 
action or producers of western lowsulphur coal 
gov roy romer of colorado who also participated in the meeting 
said that federal legislastion should include flexibility for 
different states to meet the emission reductions 
for example the governors said the coalition opposed a federal 
requirement for utilities to install expensive scrubbers to 
reduce sulphur emissions or for the federal government to provide 
subsidies for the installation of such scrubbers 
perpich said the group told reilly that requiring scrubbers 
will double the cost of cleanup weaken political support in 
the west and south and increase global warming problems because of 
increased carbon dioxide emissions 
the governor declined to provide specific provisions they would 
want to see in federal acid rain legislation except to say that it 
should require specific emissionreduction requirements 
whatever acid rain legislation emerges from congress its 
provisions must be strictly enforced perpich said the group told 
reilly 
if utilities dont reduce their pollution as the law requires 
they should pay stiff taxes based on the amount of pollution they 
are releasing into the air we need to make the punishment fit the 
crime he added 
among those who met with reilly were scott matheson former 
governor of utah hugh carey former governor of new york and now an 
executive at wr grace co ned helme executive director of the 
center for clean air policy and former wisconsin sen gaylord 
nelson an official of the wilderness society

each seat when soviets cast ballots for a new parliament on march 
26 an election official said wednesday 
some voting districts will still only have one candidate but 
others will have three or four said dmitry golovko deputy director 
of the central electoral commission 
the new parliament the congress of peoples deputies will have 
2250 members and will elect a supreme soviet from within its ranks

two candidates will compete for one seat in nearly 1000 
constituencies and more than 200 have registered three or more 
candidates golovko said 
the complex process of nominating candidates from 1500 regional 
election districts began in december and ended on feb 23 with the 
registration of candidates with the central electoral commission 
candidates put forward by official organizations such as the 
communist party and large trade unions were registered on jan 29

communist party a percentage higher than in previous elections 20 
percent were women and nearly 40 percent were workers or farmers 
the soviet people are playing an active part in this campaign 
and have sent more than 7000 letters and suggestions to the central 
electoral commission over the past three months golovko said

law which has confused many voters golovko admitted the law had 
some imprecisions that need clarification 
the commission will analyze the current election campaign and 
submit suggestions to the soviet parliament to improve the soviet 
electoral law he said 
if a candidate fails to win a 51 percent majority a new election 
will be held in that district within two weeks of the march 26

an oil slick in antarctica caused by a 
peruvian scientific ship that ran aground has grown to more than a 
halfmile long and rough weather has hampered cleanup efforts the 
navy reported wednesday 
it was the first indication that the slick from the sunday 
accident the second in a month in the region is more serious than 
originally thought in another report earlier wednesday the navy 
called the oil spill minor 
winds reaching up to 80 miles per hour prevented efforts to right 
the 1980ton humbolt and clean up the slick of diesel oil leaking 
from two of the ships fuel tanks the navy said in a communique 
frogmen from the nearby uruguayan and south korean antarctic 
stations finally succeeded wednesday in checking the vessels hull 
after stormy weather prevented them from doing so for two days 
the communique did not describe the extent of the damage but a 
navy spokesman in punta arenas 1500 miles south of santiago said 
the damage does not seem to be serious 
the spokesman lt cristian carbone said authorities are 
confident they will be able to float the humboldt soon 
the navy communique said a chilean air force helicopter flew over 
the humboldt on wednesday and its crew reported that the slick 
expanded to more than a halfmile long and 150 feet wide 
on monday the chilean navy reported the slick to be 450 feet long 
and 15 feet wide 
the navy had also said earlier that stormy weather in the area 
has prevented the beginning of a cleanup operation 
the humboldt ran aground around midnight sunday at the entrance 
of marion cove on king george island all 64 scientists and sailors 
aboard were rescued unharmed by the british royal navys ice patrol 
ship endurance 
on wednesday however a group of sailors were back on the ship 
to start preparing the operation to float it according to the navy 
communique 
a cutter from the chilean navy the yelcho was scheduled to 
reach the humboldt at dawn thursday carrying personnel and 
equipment both for the floating operation and cleanup 
on jan 28 a ship from the argentine navy the bahia paraiso 
paradise bay ran aground 300 miles from the site of the humboldt 
accident creating a major oil slick the slick was eventually 
cleaned up in an international operation that involved ships and 
personnel from argentina chile and the united states

president bush should convene a conference on 
homelessness because a coherent national strategy to deal with the 
problem is urgently needed said sen albert gore who introduced 
legislation wednesday to authorize such a meeting 
now is the time for president bush to show the leadership this 
issue demands said the tennessee democrat 
citing studies predicting 18 million americans will be homeless 
by the turn of the century if current policies continue gore said 
a coherent longrange strategy is urgently needed 
this isnt the only answer but it is an essential ingredient 
to the comprehensive effective policy we need he added 
gore an author of the stewart b mckinney homeless assistance 
act said he welcomed recent trips to shelters for the homeless b 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp bush has pledged 
to provide the 6828 million authorized by congress in that 
legislation 
the white house conference we are proposing today can provide 
substantive direction for their good intentions gore said 
gores proposal for a white house conference would authorize 
meetings and require a report to include specific recommendations 
for executive and legislative action on homelessness within six 
months after the sessions 
boston mayor raymond flynn who accompanied gore at a news 
conference to announce the proposal said the conference would be 
welcome news to local and state officials who have been 
providing shelter for the homeless after cuts in the federal housing 
budget during the reagan administration 
flynn had testified earlier as head of the us conference of 
mayors task force on hunger and homelessness at a house 
subcommitteee on housing and community development hearing which 
focused on the need for permanent affordable housing for low and 
moderateincome people 
flynn told the panel he had proposed a white house conference to 
bush

william j bennett promised senators wednesday 
to shun the role of a mere figurehead in the national drugfighting 
job to which president bush has nominated him 
however commenting at his confirmation hearing bennett 
sidestepped questions on a substantive issue legislation to ban 
militarystyle assault rifles sometimes used by drug pushers 
why would you take this job to be a figurehead bennett asked 
the senate judiciary committee the pay is not so good the hours 
are horrible and the subject matter is depressing 
lawmakers questioned the former secretary of education closely on 
whether as head of the governments war on drug abuse he would be 
willing and able to engage in vigorous political infighting with 
cabinet secretaries who might be protective of their own power and 
prerogatives 
he promised that he would speak out within administration 
councils 
i dont think lack of candor has been my problem the 
outspoken bennett told the hearing drawing laughter from the 
audience 
the tone was more somber however when sens edward m kennedy 
dmass asked bennett if he would support legislation that would 
outlaw semiautomatic weapons such as ak47s and uzis favored by drug 
pushers 
kennedy also quoted a 1988 memo in which bennett had proposed 
considering efforts to outlaw automatic and certain other 
weapons 
the current dispute in congress is over semiautomatic weapons it 
is still possible for private individuals to own fully automatic 
weapons but only after meeting an array of difficulttofulfill 
requirements 
what logical or reasonable way is there for a citizen to own an 
ak47 kennedy asked bennett 
thats a good question bennett replied 
im waiting for an answer kennedy said 
ill give you one in six months bennett said 
bennett also told lawmakers there can be no quick victory in the 
war against narcotics 
it will take more than 180 days to turn the tide around he 
said 
opening the hearing the judiciary committee chairman sen 
joseph biden ddel said he understood that it would take time to 
get the job done and that there would be some failures along the way 
biden said if bennett used the full powers of his office to 
combat drug abuse we will run all the political interference you 
need but if the effort ran out of steam then you have a critic 
sitting up here 
bennett appeared a virtual shooin for approval by the panel 
with his sharpest critic sen paul simon dill saying i think 
i might be the only one to vote no and even he left the door open 
to voting in support of bennetts nomination as director of the 
office of national drug policy 
the office was created under wideranging crime legislation 
approved last fall and requires the director to draw up a national 
strategy aimed at coordinating the war on drugs 
the opening of the hearing entailed little more than opening 
statements and primarily afforded senators a chance to air their 
special concerns as well as lap up a sizeable helping of the 
attention that the drug issue always provides sen alan simpson 
rwyo told the panel that everybody likes to mess with it 
because you get sevencamera congressional hearings out of it 
in two hours of welcoming remarks by about a dozen lawmakers 
sen arlen specter rpa put in a plug for a 10 billion 
prisonconstruction idea saying rehabilitation of crimeprone 
addicts was important but if they become career criminals you 
have to throw away the key 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio sponsor of a bill to outlaw 
sale of militarystyle assault rifles warned bennett not to ignore 
the tie between drug abuse and the use of semiautomatic weapons by 
criminals 
the ceremonial comments dragged on so long that sen gordon 
humphrey rnh merely inserted his statement in the record 
saying two hours of welcoming remarks are about as stupefying as 
some drugs 
simon said he remained undecided about whether to support the 
veteran federal official as drug czar saying he had once voted with 
enthusiasm to confirm bennett as head of the national endowment for 
the humanities 
i was less enthusiastic at the end of your term simon said 
if we were to elect a national gadfly on the drug issue you 
would get my vote very quickly simon said the more troubling 
question is whether you can be an effective administrator 
simon said he also was disappointed by bennetts performance as 
secretary of education 
i want from your office not a blizzard of press releases 
simon said i want a solid job on what is really a massive problem 
in our society 
humphrey said bennetts habit of using his cabinet post as a 
bully pulpit to crusade for upgrading education might be 
described as the activities of a gadfly a term which i dont 
share but nonetheless it has importance he hailed the nominees 
solid record of accomplishment

heroism by both passengers and crew saved 
countless lives during the unbelievable horror when a united 
airlines jet ripped open over the pacific spilling nine passengers 
to their deaths a crew member said 
i felt like dorothy in the wizard of oz when her house gets 
picked up and everything gets blown away purser sarah shanahan 
said in an interview in wednesdays editions of the honolulu 
starbulletin 
we had some flight attendants who had to hang on to the first 
class stairwell when it actually happened and by golly it held 
it helped to protect the lives of at least three people that i know 
of said shanahan 42 who has worked for united for 21 years 
federal investigators suspect the forward cargo door on the 
boeing 747 jet uniteds flight 811 bound for auckland new zealand 
popped open during the flight friday tearing a 10by20foot hole 
in the planes fuselage the plane carried 354 people including 18 
crew members 
i instantly knew that we had a hole in the airplane said 
shanahan she said her first reaction was to find oxygen to keep 
from passing out 
because of the damage the planes emergency oxygen system did 
not activate investigators said shanahan said she searched 
desperately for an oxygen bottle finally finding one and taking a 
few real strong inhalations to regain her strength 
then i stopped and i collected my thoughts for just a second i 
realized that the plane was flying it was not in an uncontrolled 
rapid descent 
capt david m cronin flew the crippled jet 100 miles on two of 
four engines landing safely at honolulu international airport 25 
minutes later twentyseven people were injured with only two still 
hospitalized wednesday 
shanahan said it was truly a miracle that there were not more 
injuries to people from things flying around in the cabin there 
were ice buckets racks of glasses cartons of juice and bins of 
things around 
the decompression of the plane took only a few seconds and 
during that time anything that wasnt nailed down moved she 
said 
shanahan said she inched her way forward and saw an incredible 
amount of structural damage and that two or three crew members 
were helping passengers 
they were reassuring people i could see them physically 
touching arms i dont know what they were saying because the noise 
was so incredible you couldnt hear yourself think sanahan said 
she started walking back through the cabin telling passengers to 
put on life vests and inflate one chamber she said she tried using 
the public address system but it was too noisy for it to be heard 
so she found a megaphone 
shanahan said she instructed the passengers to tighten their seat 
belts grab their ankles and stay down until you know were back 
on earth and weve stopped 
she said she found three young men and assigned them to help with 
the evacuation upon landing instructing them on how to open the 
emergency exit and deploy the inflatable slide making them repeat 
the instructions back to her 
she said she told them this is a critical job they will pile 
up at the bottom of the slide they will get badly injured it is 
vital that you stay there 
and they did god bless them they did shanahan said 
when the captain announced that the plane was two minutes from 
the end of the runway people kept unfastening their seat belts 
and standing up to look out the windows she said im sure that 
they wanted the reassurance they wanted to see those honolulu city 
lights 
thats why im hoarse i screamed for two minutes grab your 
ankles stay down stay down stay down shanahan said 
it was the best landing it was just perfect it was smooth it 
was wonderful she said 
once the plane stopped shanhan said she whipped open the door 
and began ordering the passengers to form double lines and leap onto 
the slide 
shanahan said she didnt know until she was off the plane that 
passengers had been lost it was only then that she saw the size of 
the hole

greenpeace accused britain on wednesday of being a 
leading producer and exporter of the chemicals that are destroying 
the ozone layer the charge was made on the eve of a world 
conference here on ozone problems

produced 105000 tons of chlorofluorocarbon gases and exported 
48146 tons 
the compounds widely used in refrigerator coolants foam 
insulation fastfood packaging and propellants for aerosol spray 
cans are destroying the ozone layer the fragile atmospheric 
shield that protects the earths surface from the suns 
cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
the compounds also contribute to the greenhouse effect trapping 
heat gradually warming the earths surface and contributing to 
potentially dangerous shifts in global weather patterns 
prime minister margaret thatcher said wednesday her government 
plans to require all new refrigerators to use safer solvents and all 
new cars to take unleaded gasoline by 1990 
she spoke in an interview for the british broadcasting corp

britain has invited government ministers industry leaders and 
scientists to a threeday conference beginning sunday to discuss 
practical steps to reduce the problems more than 110 countries have 
accepted 
britain has vowed to reduce chloroflurocarbon emissions by 85 
percent by 1999 an additional 30 countries have ratified the 1987 
montreal protocol that calls for a 50 percent reduction by then 
greenpeace wants the compounds banned immediately 
some chloroflurocarbons have a life of at least 380 years so 
each one we produce adds to the potentially lethal legacy we are 
leaving for 10 generations said greenpeace spokesman steve 
elsworth 
greenpeace said annual world consumption of chloroflurocarbons is 
estimated to be 1 million to 12 million tons it said west europe 
and the united states accounted for 736 percent of production in 
1984 and 70 percent of consumption in 1985 
environment secretary nicholas ridley told reporters wednesday a 
big demand remains worldwide for chloroflurocarbons and joint 
international efforts are needed to reduce it 
greenpeace said no one has ever published a countrybycountry 
list of chloroflurocarbon producers containing precise production 
figures 
lord caithness a junior environment minister confirmed at a 
briefing on the weekend conference that britain is one of the 
largest chloroflurocarbon producers but added america is more 
of a bigger producer than us 
greenpeace said a 1988 report written for the french ministry of 
the environment lists the capacity of chloroflurocarbon plants 
worldwide and estimated that european economic community plants 
operated at 70 percent capacity on average britain is one of the 12 
eec members 
by matching capacity with performance greenpeace said it arrived 
at its production figures showing that in 1984 the main producer 
of chloroflurocarbons was the united states with 455000 tons or 
374 percent of world production 
it was followed by west europe with 440000 tons or 362 percent 
of production japan with 150000 tons or 124 percent and 
communist countries with 120000 tons or 41 percent 
greenpeace said britain has a production capacity of 150000 
tons so if it operated last year at the 70 percent average it 
would have produced 105000 tons

imposing the death penalty on teenager paula 
cooper who admitted stabbing an elderly woman to death violates 
the indiana and us constitutions her lawyers argued wednesday 
we do not say that paula was not responsible for what she 
did defense attorney william l touchette told the indiana 
supreme court what we are saying is that the death sentence in 
this case violates the 8th amendment to the constitution which 
protects against cruel and unusual punishment 
cooper pleaded guilty to murder in 1986 for the killing of ruth 
elizabeth pelke a 78yearold bible teacher who was stabbed at 
least 30 times with a butcher knife on may 14 1985 
three other teenagers from gary ind went to trial and were 
convicted of murder in the case 
cooper who was 15 at the time of the crime was accused of 
masterminding the robbery and killing mrs pelke in her gary home 
she is the youngest female in the united states to be sentenced to 
death 
touchette argued that lake superior court judge james c 
kimbrough failed to consider coopers abusive family environment as 
a mitigating circumstance in the crime if he had the attorney 
argued it would have prohibited him from sentencing her to die in 
the electric chair 
however gary secrest a deputy attorney general said the judge 
did consider coopers family background her age and her clean 
record but found that it did not weigh heavily enough to save her 
from the death penalty 
its important to remember the brutality of the crime 
secrest said its important to remember that it was preplanned 
and premeditated 
at the time of coopers conviction indiana law allowed the 
execution of anyone over age 10 convicted of murder that age limit 
has since been raised to 16 but was not made retroactive 
also attending the supreme court hearing was a delegation of 
seven italians representing the humanrights group thou shalt not 
kill 
cooper has becoome a popular cause in italy for opponents of the 
death penalty last june members of amnesty international submitted 
petitions from nearly 2 million italians who wanted thengov robert 
orr to commute her sentence 
in rome about 100 protesters marched wednesday night to the 
office of the united nations to support coopers appeal the rev 
vito bracone a spokesman for the delegation that traveled to 
indiana said about 400 of his countrymen were fasting and praying 
for cooper 
the italian delegation planned to visit cooper 19 at the 
indiana womens prison on thursday before traveling to new york to 
address the united nations 
americans protest and pay money to save the whales the eagles 
the wolves and other creatures bracone said at a news conference 
why dont you think its worth it to rehabilitate a human being 
also speaking at the news conference was william pelke 41 who 
introduced himself as a grandson of ruth pelke and friend of paula 
cooper pelke said he has written letters to cooper and believes 
she is remorseful for her crime 
i have a deep love and compassion for paula pelke said my 
grandmother was a christian woman and it was through her that i 
learned love prayer and forgiveness i know that revenge is not the 
answer 
the supreme court justices did not say how long it would take 
them to reach a decision on the appeal

after 39 years of mandatory 
residential segregation a new law took effect wednesday that will 
allow a few carefully selected multiracial neighborhoods 
in a separate development the government announced it has 
commuted the death sentences of 16 prisoners including an activist 
who was the subject of clemency appeals from the united nations 
the government also agreed to release 50 detainees held without 
charge antiapartheid church leaders said wednesday following a 
meeting with the minister of law and order adriaan vlok the 
churchmen said that will bring to 279 the number of releases vlok 
has authorized in the past two weeks 
the government has hailed the legalization of integrated 
neighborhoods as a milestone but an opposition newspaper called it 
a halfbaked plan that will create a few overcrowded multiracial 
areas while segregation prevails elsewhere 
most observers expect that multiracial neighborhoods will be 
limited to a handful of new housing developments and to innercity 
neighborhoods that already have become integrated despite 
segregation laws 
decisions on establishing integrated neighborhoods will be made 
by an eightmember board dominated by government supporters one 
member is black 
the board is supposed to take community sentiment into 
consideration and the government has made clear that no white 
neighborhoods will be integrated if there is significant opposition 
this act does not change the present living and residential 
patterns of our communities acting president chris heunis said 
last week but it gives those people who wish to associate freely 
with one another the democratic choice to do so 
heunis is filling in for president pw botha who is 
recuperating from a stroke 
the star a liberal johannesburg newspaper with the countrys 
largest daily circulation acknowledged that the act will allow 
people of different races to live together legally for the first 
time since residential segregation was mandated by the group areas 
act in 1950 
yet it does this in such a halfbaked and limited way that it 
is likely to aggravate not alleviate slum conditions said the 
star in an editorial tuesday 
it predicted that a handful of free settlement areas will 
rapidly become overcrowded leading to problems that the government 
will blame on integration 
the 16 prisoners who had their death sentences commuted included 
one man of mixedrace and 15 blacks among them paul setlaba 
convicted of committing murder during a 1985 black consumer boycott 
the justice ministry gave no explanation for the action merely 
listing the prisoners granted clemency in each case the death 
sentence was commuted to a prison term ranging from 10 years to 
life 
setlabas planned execution was stayed by justice minister kobie 
coetsee in november hours before he was to be hanged the stay 
followed appeals for clemency by human rights groups in south africa 
and by the un security council which depicted setlaba as an 
antiapartheid activist caught up in political unrest 
details of the other reprieved prisoners cases were not 
disclosed 
the release of 50 prisoners held without charge came in response 
to a series of hunger strikes by up to 400 inmates in south africa 
vlok gave the delegation his assurance that the process of 
releasing detainees would continue church leaders said in a 
statement

industrial nations must pursue noninflationary 
economic growth to stimulate world trade and provide growing markets 
for their own exports and those of lessdeveloped countries the 
bush administration said wednesday in a report to congress 
the report from the treasury department and the office of the 
us trade representative said the united states and its major 
trading partners were committed to making the changes needed to 
reduce imbalances in world trade 
germany and japan both countries with large trade surpluses 
need to take steps to ensure open and growing domestic markets the 
report said 
the united states meanwhile is committed to substantial 
federal budget deficit reductions improving its international 
competitiveness and bolstering its savings rate it said 
the report noted that most economies are structured in ways that 
can hinder international efforts to coordinate monetary fiscal and 
exchange rate policies to promote world trade 
it said the industrial nations agreed at the toronto economic 
summit last year to pursue specific reforms that would reduce such 
barriers through steps such as cutting subsidies that impede the 
international flow of resources reforming tax systems that 
discourage innovation and reducing burdensome regulations 
such a course is well suited to producing mediumterm solutions 
to what are after all mediumterm problems the report said 
the report projected that without policy changes japans trade 
surplus in goods and services would drop significantly in the 
next two years from about 80 billion this year while germany with 
export growth rebounding would see its overall surplus largely 
unchanged 
englands ballooning of its trade deficit in 1988 is unlikely to 
be reversed and france italy and canada should collectively have 
about the same deficit in 1990 that they did in 1988 it said 
the united states meanwhile expects to see increases in exports 
exceed growth in imports although rising payments on the national 
debt will hold back the overall reductions in the trade deficit 
the us trade deficit in 1988 posted its first improvement since 
1980 narrowing to 13734 billion from an alltime high of 17032 
billion in 1987 
the report said lessdeveloped countries also must move to 
promote world trade these countries especially those that are 
heavily in debt must adopt policies that support domestic growth 
reduce inflation and encourage support from banks and international 
financial institutions it said 
the trade projection report was required under the omnibus trade 
act of 1988

islamic flags flew over israeli arab cities 
wednesday as moslem fundamentalists celebrated their victories in 
municipal elections the results of which have frightened many jews 
the islamic movement competing for the first time in tuesdays 
balloting emerged as a growing influence among the 400000 eligible 
arab voters in israel 
the movement challenged the communist party the traditional 
dominant force in arab municipalities and scored a landslide 
victory in umm el fahem the secondlargest arab town 
it also took over the three smaller cities of kafr kassim kafr 
bara and kafr kana and won seats in four other city councils 
including six seats of the 19member council in the town of 
nazareth often called red nazareth because of its communist 
affiliation 
although jewish leaders expressed fears that the results 
indicated growing extremism in the arab sector arab analysts said 
the islamic movement had won because it provided badly needed 
municipal services 
lutfy mashour editor of the arabiclanguage sinara newspaper in 
nazareth said the islamic victory was not a matter of religion 
its a matter of services 
in umm el fahem sheikh raed salah mahajneh a bearded 
30yearold preacher won more than 72 percent of the vote or 11 of 
15 seats on the city council defeating the towns communist mayor 
islam will sweep the world a triumphant aide at mahajnehs 
office said we in umm el fahem take the best from the communists 
and the best from the capitalists this is islam 
flags of islam traditionally green flew over the galilee city 
of over 20000 and jubilant residents circled through town in their 
cars plastered with green party stickers creating a huge traffic 
jam 
the fundamentalist victories alarmed israeli jewish leaders of 
virtually all parties 
the islamic movements aim is to gain leadership in israels 
arab sector its a very worrisome sign said interior minister 
arye deri of the ultraorthodox shas party 
uzi baram of the leftleaning labor party said he preferred the 
communist party which at least grants legitimacy to the state of 
israel and sees itself as part of it 
the islamic movement is a dangerous movement he said on 
israel television 
the islamic movements leader sheikh abdallah nimer darwish 
said his party would abide by the law and would not harm the state 
of israel by word or by deed 
arab analysts said the movement gained its power by providing 
services to the population 
its a local issue said hashem abdel rachman a spokesman 
for the islamic movement people saw that the islamic movement 
gave them good services and voted according to what they saw 
analysts said it took the movement about five years of building 
schools and running volunteer camps to win over umm el fahem which 
an arab reporter described as easily the worst slum in israel 
many roads in the city are not paved and there are serious sewage 
problems

ben johnsons track coach testified wednesday that 
he turned the canadian sprinter on to steroids in 1981 because their 
use was necessary to keep up with the competition 
johnson won the gold medal and set a world record in the 
100meter race at the summer olympics in seoul last year but was 
stripped of both after he tested positive for steroid use johnson 
has maintained that he never knowingly used drugs to enhance his 
performance 
but charlie francis who has been johnsons coach since 1977 
told a canadian inquiry into drugs and sports that he put johnson on 
a steroid program in 1981 
francis said he first approached johnson about steroids that 
summer but johnson was not sure of the advantages that fall 
francis said johnson decided he would go on 
if he wanted to compete its pretty clear that steroids are 
worth a meter at the highest level of sports francis said i 
think he understood that his competitors were on them 
francis only previous statement since the olympics was that the 
sprinters urine test may have been sabotaged 
francis said that toplevel international competition is 
virtually impossible without steroids he cautioned against 
believing any claims from toplevel athletes that they are clean and 
that their records are the result only of hard work 
it just isnt true not at the highest level francis said 
he said repeatedly that steroids are not a short cut but the 
reason toplevel athletes are able to train as hard as they do

a hopelessly deadlocked national economic 
commission failing to reach a grand compromise to solve the 
nations fiscal problems issued a final report wednesday that split 
essentially along party lines 
the commissions seven republicans and the one democrat appointed 
by president bush endorsed the presidents 1990 fiscal budget 
calling it a workable plan for eliminating the deficit without 
resorting to higher taxes 
but the commissions six democrats refused to go along with the 
majority report and instead issued a minority document which 
castigated bushs 116 trillion budget charging that it employed 
unrealistic economic assumptions and failed to distribute the pain 
of deficit reduction equally among different segments of society 
the bush budget rules out any discussion of additional revenues 
and relies heavily on hard and disproportionate reductions in 
domestic spending many of which have been rejected repeatedly by 
the congress and the american people the democrats wrote 
however the democrats did not offer their own plan for dealing 
with the deficit and they did not specifically endorse higher taxes 
although many of them have stated the need for higher revenues 
the 14member commission which now goes out of existence was 
labeled a huge disappointment by supporters who once believed it 
offered the best hope in the early days of a new administration of 
crafting a workable compromise of spending cuts and tax increases 
that would balance the governments books 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said the 
commission could have offered political cover for both congress 
and the bush administration to make the hard choices needed to solve 
the deficit problem 
however with little support or leadership from the president 
or congress the commission was unable to face up to the difficult 
issues it had no choice but to punt panetta said 
commission member rep william gray iii dpa and a former 
house budget committee chairman blamed partisanship by republicans 
for the groups failure to succeed 
the president didnt want a bipartisan deficit reduction plan 
he wanted his own plan the flexible freeze and he insisted on it 
from republican members gray said instead of something bold 
that could have moved us forward we end up leaving it to congress 
and the administration to continue the fight 
both democratic cochairman robert strauss and republican 
cochairman drew lewis said they were disappointed that the 
commission failed to come up with a solution to the deficit dilemma 
while strauss blamed the stalemate on bushs intransigence on the 
tax question lewis said that the panels work had also been made 
more difficult by a court suit brought by several news organizations 
which forced the panel to hold all of its meetings in open session 
it was virtually impossible to meet as a bipartisan group and 
really hash out the tough issues with the press there he said 
not everyone was disappointed with the outcome commission member 
dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation and 
one of the most outspoken opponents of tax increases said the 
majority report reflected the will of taxpayers throughout the 
nation who had clearly indicated opposition to higher taxes and 
irresponsible spending 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the commission did the best they could he said that specific 
suggestions made in the majority report for reforming the budget 
process were very useful 
bush had been openly critical of the commission during the 
presidential campaign saying if elected he would reject any report 
which called for higher taxes the panel which was created by 
congress in the wake of the october 1987 stock market crash had the 
backing of bushs republican primary opponent sen bob dole rkan 
both reports called for budget surpluses in future years to build 
up surpluses needed to cover the retirement of the baby boom 
generation 
the republican report offered a detailed list of suggestions for 
reforming the budget process including a constitutional 
balancedbudget amendment presidential lineitem veto authority and 
greater involvement of the executive branch in the congressional 
budget process many of the ideas were long championed by ronald 
reagan and have also been endorsed by bush 
the republican report also recommended a twoyear budget process 
replacing the house and senate budget committees with a joint panel 
and basing budget decisions on actual spending in the current year 
rather than projected spending levels for the next fiscal year 
bush appointed the final two members in december former sen 
paul laxalt rnev and longtime friend thomas lud ashley a 
former democratic congressman from ohio who joined the republicans 
in endorsing the majority report but he decided against extending 
the panels march 1 reporting deadline for another six months a 
step many on the panel had urged as a way of keeping the commission 
alive in the hopes that it eventually could reach a consensus 
that decision basically sealed the panels fate and with only a 
few weeks remaining the panel abandoned efforts for any compromise 
and began drafting majority and minority reports 
republicans who joined ashley in signing the majority report were 
lewis kleckner laxalt and sen pete domenici rnm rep bill 
frenzel rminn and former defense secretaries caspar weinberger 
and donald rumsfeld 
democrats signing the minority report were strauss sen patrick 
moynihan dny gray and chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca 
aflcio president lane kirkland and new york investment banker felix

us immigration agents apprehended 27 
more suspected illegal aliens wednesday on a flight bound for new 
york city bringing to 175 the number detained in a threeday 
government crackdown 
ins agents acting on a tip from a regular commuter on the 
piedmont airlines flight were waiting for the 25 males and two 
females shortly before 7 am during a stopover at charlottedouglas 
international airport 
the group on the flight which originated in phoenix included 
two mexicans eight brazilians 14 el salvadorans and three 
ecuadorans said tom thomas an ins spokesman 
by 4 pm the detainees taken off the jetliner had been 
interviewed fingerprinted photographed and put on a bus for an 
immigration and naturalization service processing center near 
brownsville texas 
the bust was part of a threeday crackdown against alien 
smuggling rings that netted 175 suspected illegal aliens in 
charlotte atlanta and los angeles authorities said 
none of the aliens spoke english most of them spent the day 
sleeping off the effects of their long ordeal which began monday 
night in los angeles 
according to the ins the aliens boarded america west airlines 
flight 1277 in los angeles at 10 pm monday night bound for 
phoenix there they boarded piedmont flight 1522 bound for new york 
city with a stopover in charlotte 
on monday 79 suspected illegal aliens were apprehended aboard an 
eastern airlines flight also bound for new york during a stopover 
in atlanta the same day 69 others were taken into custody as they 
tried to board the same flight in los angeles 
david carmichael an ins agent in charlotte said his agency was 
alerted by a regular commuter on the piedmont flight who had seen 
television news reports of mondays apprehensions which also had 
stemmed from a commuters tip 
the source told us he had taken the same flight on february 
15th and he noticed 30 to 40 people who looked to him like the same 
people he saw on the news carmichael said 
donald young of the inss charlotte office said one airline 
official told him wednesday that smuggling rings have been moving as 
many as 30 aliens on the same piedmont flight three times a week for 
the past several months 
the publicity we get out of this might cause it to dry up for 
awhile and force them to change their tactics young said but 
this isnt going to stop these people from coming into the country 
looking for work 
carmichael said authorities were trying to determine whether any 
of the 27 taken into custody in charlotte were part of the smuggling 
ring 
were talking to a couple of them more than some of the 
others he said for example one had six airline tickets in his 
possession when we took him into custody 
illegal aliens pay smugglers as much as 4000 apiece to get them 
into the united states and to a place where they can find work 
the arrangements are usually made before they ever leave home 
carmichael said 
thomas who works out of the ins office in atlanta said the 
aliens would be given the opportunity to have a hearing before a 
deportation judge in texas or choose to voluntarily leave the 
country 
most of them will be deported in a week or so he said 
thomas said the smuggling rings have been around for years but only 
recently have ins officials found large groups of aliens booked on 
airline flights 
wednesdays operation was not the first time that illegal aliens 
have been removed from the same piedmont flight thomas said 
on oct 6 15 aliens were removed from the flight at the 
charlotte airport six days later 17 more were seized he said 
the unique thing about this is that they are now flying in such 
large numbers he said

military style assault weapons and 
shortbarreled shotguns became illegal here wednesday under a 
disputed law that critics say has turned thousands of citizens into 
lawbreakers 
the ban in the nations second largest city which took effect at 
midnight tuesday was driven by public outrage over streetgang 
warfare waged with military arms and by the jan 17 slaying of five 
schoolchildren in stockton calif 
the stockton killer patrick purdy used an akm47 assault rifle 
a semiautomatic version of the gun used around the world by soviet 
bloc troops to gun down the children he then killed himself with 
another weapon 
on tuesday albert edward gulart jr 20 purdys halfbrother 
was arrested on weapons charges after his home was staked out by 
officers who had questioned him following the schoolyard killings 
police seized a semiautomatic 9mm ingram mac10 machine pistol 
an m1 carbine ammunition artillery shells blasting caps and 
other explosives from gularts home in modesto calif about 300 
miles north of los angeles 
los angeles police have said they will not actively look for 
owners of guns defined as illegal under the citys new law and by 
midday wednesday there had been no arrests reported as a result of 
the new misdemeanor offense 
gun shop owners aided by the national rifle association have 
challenged gun laws imposed in los angeles and stockton 
gun owners were left confused by the possibility that the law 
they might be violating could be overturned or displaced by a state 
law 
it puts the gun collector or owner in an awkward civic and 
economic position said local gun owner steve levine there 
could be a considerable investment involved there has been no 
compensation addressed in the law theyre just telling people you 
have to get rid of them 
deputy city attorney byron boeckman suggested owners of the 
illegal weapons not take them outside of their homes except to 
take them to the los angeles police department he recommended 
that gun owners ask officers to keep custody of the weapons until 
the issue is decided in court 
the nra challenge filed with the state supreme court contends 
that the state rather than local government has the right to 
legislate gun ownership 
boeckman said the state has failed to show a clear intent to 
regulate assault rifles leaving it open for local legislation 
even as those arguments were put forward the assembly public 
safety committee approved a ban on the sale of two dozen specified 
assault weapons including the ak47 later the senate judiciary 
committee narrowly approved a broader bill 
both bills would allow anyone who lawfully possesses assault 
weapons before oct 1 1989 to keep them by registering them with 
the department of justice both bills went fiscal committees the 
last stop before the floors in each house 
richard gardiner assistant general counsel for the nra said the 
organization was contacting lawmakers to lobby against the 
legislation 
gardiner said the los angeles ordinance probably has affected 
hundreds of thousands of gun owners in the city 
the angeles county board of supervisors voted 32 tuesday not to 
ban semiautomatic weapons within the countys unincorporated areas 
however the board voted to support a statewide ban of such weapons 
the ban in the city of los angeles approved by the city council 
in february makes it a misdemeanor to own a semiautomatic gun 
sales of the guns within city limits became illegal immediately 
after passage of the ordinance 
the measure bans semiautomatic rifles and carbines with a 
capacity of 20 rounds or more and shortbarreled shotguns that hold 
six rounds or more banned by name are the uzi ak47 akm47 
ar15 ingram mac10 and mac11

thousands of people demonstrating 
against ethnic albanians massed outside parliament on wednesday 
while a senior official inside told lawmakers ethnic violence 
threatens to tear yugoslavia apart 
lazar mojsov a member of the ruling 12man state presidency 
also charged that an illegal group of ethnic albanians has detailed 
plans to disrupt southern kosovo province the staterun news agency 
tanjug said 
the integrity of yugoslavia is jeopardized to the extreme 
degree mojsov said in comments carried on belgrade radio 
the government indefinitely extended a ban on all public 
gatherings in kosovo tanjug said following more than a week of 
widespread unrest in the province 
outside parliament about 4000 members of the serb and 
montenegrin minority from kosovo blocked streets and chanted songs 
to protest alleged persecution in the province by albanians who 
make up 90 percent of kosovos estimated 2 million people 
mojsov told the assembly 50000 slavs emigrated from kosovo since 
1981 because of harassment 
the flagcarrying protesters were joined by at least 10000 
belgrade sympathizers on tuesday a belgrade rally led by serbian 
communist party boss slobodan milosevic drew an estimated 500000 
people 
taxi drivers carrying large portraits of milosevic on their 
cars provided free transportation for the elderly 
the mainly christian serbs believe the predominantly moslem 
albanians in kosovo which was ancient serbias heartland want to 
unite the province with neighboring albania the ethnic albanians 
have demanded that kosovos autonomy not be restricted 
growing ethnic nationalism and an economic crisis have created 
the greatest threat to yugoslav unity since the 1980 death of 
president tito whose leadership held the loose confederation of six 
republics and two provinces together the countrys 23 million 
citizens belong to a number of different nationalities and religions 
mojsov said the presidency has retrieved a document signed by 
members of an illegal kosovo group detailing plans for 
destabilizing the province according to tanjug 
the plans initial stage reportedly called for passive strikes 
in factories firms schools and universities and other actions 
which mojsov said were carried out in full last week 
the parliament met to discuss the deteriorating security in the 
country following the kosovo protests and counterdemonstrations by 
angry serbs in belgrade and other parts of serbia 
frontier controls have been tightened to prevent the bringing 
in of explosives arms ammunition hostile propaganda material and 
illegal crossings of the countrys borders vice premier janez 
zemljaric told parliament 
a ban on gatherings in kosovo was introduced in november when up 
to 100000 ethnic albanians demonstrated in kosovos capital 
pristina against the forced resignations of some top ethnic albanian 
provincial leaders as demanded by serbia 
the ban as extended wednesday also prohibits massive arrivals 
in the province this was apparently designed to prevent serbs from

a unarmed federal drug agent shot to death in an 
undercover operation was wearing a radio transmitter and had five 
backup men but they lost contact as he drove off with the man 
suspected of killing him officials said wednesday 
the murder of undercover special agent everette hatcher on 
tuesday was the first killing of a drug enforcement administration 
officer in the new york area since 1972 said dea spokesman robert 
strang 
the dea fbi and police issued an allpoints bulletin for 
constible gus farace 28 of staten island 
farace was released from the elmira correction facility in june 
1988 after serving eight years for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 
a new jersey teenager said police sources who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
us attorney andrew maloney said he would seek the death penalty 
under the new federal drug bill when hatchers killer is caught 
investigators do not believe hatchers cover was blown or that 
he was known to be a law enforcement officer said william y 
doran special agent in charge of the fbis criminal division 
this was not a buy and bust situation there were no drugs 
present there was no money present doran said the killing was 
out of coldbloodedness as far as we can determine 
he said hatchers wire had not been disturbed 
hatcher was found slumped over the wheel of an unmarked car on a 
deadend street on staten island at 1015 pm tuesday shot four 
times in the head and upper body apparently from outside the car 
authorities said 
shortly after 9 pm hatcher notified his backup team that he 
and farace were going to drive their cars to a diner said robert 
stutman special agent in charge of the deas new york city bureau 
shortly after that they the agents lost contact with the 
transmitter stutman said he said they had dropped back so as not 
to be spotted and there was considerable traffic 
the backup team lost sight of hatcher and began looking for the 
agent without success at various diners on the boulevard until 
returning to the original meeting area and finding hatchers car 
hatcher 46 had worked at the new york office since joining the 
dea in 1972 at the time of his death the agent was part of a joint 
deafbi task force engaged in a longterm drug investigation 
officials said 
two other dea agents have been shot and wounded in new york city 
in the last six months but none has been killed in the new york 
area since october 12 1972 when special agent frank tummillo was 
shot in a midtown hotel 
tummillos partner supervisory agent thomas j devine died 
sept 25 1982 of wounds he suffered during the 1972 shooting 
strang said

it isnt easy adopting smoking 
restrictions in the heart of tobacco country as the university of 
louisville discovered when it tried to put a stringent smoking 
policy into effect last fall 
but it is possible and new regulations went into effect 
wednesday that try to give campus smokers and nonsmokers equal 
rights to puff and not be puffed upon 
i hope that this is an issue that we can put behind us said 
dan hall a university official who met twice with the kentucky 
general assemblys tobacco task force to iron out details that 
didnt set well with lawmakers representing kentucky burley 
producers 
its a hard issue for anybody who lives in a tobacco state 
said justine speer dean of the universitys school of nursing 
the revised regulations approved by university president donald 
swain last month did away with an especially controversial 
provision in the original regulations that would have favored 
nonsmokers in disputes with smokers 
after the first draft drew fire last november some lawmakers 
threatened to cut the universitys budget 
but in december the university agreed to rewrite portions of the 
policy to make sure smokers and nonsmokers would be treated 
evenhandedly 
under the revision department heads will discuss and settle 
conflicts over smoking with employees and their supervisors 
the university feels that its been responsive to the concerns 
of many of the legislators in those two meetings and my hope is 
that it will be received as such hall said 
the new policy bans smoking in classrooms and elevators as did 
the early proposal but calls for more modest restrictions in 
hallways lounges and other public areas where smoking will be 
allowed in designated areas 
hall said the rules would be introduced gradually as signs are 
printed and posted designating the smoking and nonsmoking areas 
ms speer said nursing students and faculty worked out their own 
smoking policy several months ago before the issue surfaced 
campuswide 
nursing faculty members none of whom smoke and students voted 
not to smoke in halls outside classrooms ms speer said smoking is 
also prohibited inside classrooms 
the nursing students lounge is divided for smokers and 
nonsmokers and staff members have separate lounges she said 
although the school is sensitive to the issues of tobacco 
farmers it also wants to provide a healthful environment to 
nonsmokers she said 
there are very few people in our area who smoke anymore she 
said its just like people have learned

survey even though a spokesman said he has made up his mind 
confirmation requires a simple majority democrats hold a 5545 
majority in the senate so tower would need to hold all republicans

john tower his nomination as defense secretary 
in grave trouble made an extraordinary public admission of marital 
infidelity wednesday but vowed to keep fighting for senate 
confirmation his prospects dimmed further however by the senate 
majority leaders opposition 
president bush continued to court democrats in a lastditch 
effort to save the appointment and spokesman marlin fitzwater 
asserted well just keep up the good fight 
but senate majority leader george mitchell further dampened 
towers chances by declaring his opposition even as vice president 
dan quayle conceded the administration still lacks the votes needed 
for senate approval 
the president said his appeal to senators has been look do 
what youve got to do but remember fair play remember decency and 
honor and then remember also historically the concept of advise and 
consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to the 
president of the united states who after all is responsible for the 
executive branch of this government 
bush dispatched quayle to capitol hill to lobby for the 
nomination 
we hope the prospects improve we dont have 50 votes yet but 
were moving in that direction quayle told a white house photo 
session 
the white house effort failed with at least one conservative 
democrat sen david boren of oklahoma who announced his opposition 
to the nomination and urged tower to withdraw boren was one of two 
democrats to vote for former president reagans unpopular supreme 
court nominee robert bork 
sen bill bradley dnj who had been invited to a white house 
session with bush declared his opposition saying tower is just 
not the right person for the position of secretary of defense 
mitchell announced that floor debate on the nomination had been 
postponed until thursday as the ranking members of the senate armed 
services committee sam nunn dga and john warner rva met 
with white house counsel c boyden gray to decide what material from 
the fbi report could be made public 
tower showed flashes of grit and humor as he fielded questions at 
the national press club about allegations concerning excessive 
drinking womanizing and lucrative consulting fees he received from 
defense contractors 
asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn he replied 
by quoting from the last letter written by col william barrett 
travis the leader of the texans who fought and died at the alamo 
i shall never surrender or retreat 
the former texas senator paused briefly and said i am a little 
sorry i brought up the alamo analogy it just occurred to me what 
happened at the alamo just 10 days after travis wrote that letter 
texas defenders were wiped out by the mexicans 
tower said he regards his weekend vow to quit drinking if he wins 
confirmation as sacred and i can assure you i will abide by 
it 
his speech addressed defense policy issues matters tower said 
normally occupy the mind of the nominee of secretary of defense 
but he unflinchingly fielded questions from his audience about his 
personal behavior 
asked whether he had ever broken his wedding vows the 
twicedivorced tower said as a matter of fact i have broken 
wedding vows i think i am probably not alone in that connection 
towers second wife lilla burt cummings alleged marital 
misconduct in court papers in the couples divorce case 
but later wednesday tower aides released a statement clarifying 
his admission of marital infidelity and administration sources 
indicated tower was referring to his first marriage not his second 
the statement noted that tower in his opening testimony before 
the senate armed services committee repeatedly stated that he had 
never been unfaithful to his second wife 
the senator stands by his statement and he notes that marriage 
vows have to do with a great deal more than the question of 
infidelity the statement said however the senators oath and 
pledge to the american people is of the same character as is the 
oath to protect and defend the constitution of the united states an 
oath he has never broken 
administration sources who insisted on anonymity elaborated by 
disclosing the senate armed services committee had been told that 
tower was divorced from his first wife lou because of an 
adulterous affair with the woman who became his second wife 
there was no letup meanwhile in the political storm surrounding 
the nomination 
the administration is trying to hold all 45 republicans and sway 
five of the senates 55 democrats to get a tie vote that quayle 
could break in favor of tower 
an associated press survey of the senate found 36 republicans 
supporting the nomination 36 democrats opposed and 27 other 
senators undecided or undeclared one senator was unavailable for 
comment 
mitchell dmaine the democratic leader announced his 
opposition to the nomination in a midday speech on the senate floor 
citing towers ties to defense consultants and his drinking 
mitchells position was widely anticipated particularly since 
all democrats who have expressed an opinion on the nomination have 
opposed it and almost all republicans have endorsed it 
turning to the controversy over towers personal conduct 
mitchell told his colleagues that it is not moral perfection or 
the qualifications of senators that are at issue here it is the 
ability to serve effectively in a position of unique power and 
responsibility 
mitchell said he read the fbi report on tower and met with bush 
at the white house where he expressed his concerns about the 
nomination 
it is only after careful study of this record that i have 
concluded that john tower is not the man to provide leadership by 
example to the military and civilian employees of the department of 
defense especially in the difficult job of reforming the pentagons 
administration and procurement practices in a period of budget 
stringency mitchell said 
tower lashed out at what he said was the absence of clearly 
defined standards against which he was being judged he noted that 
several senators have said that the secretary of defense as the 
commander of us military forces behind only the president must 
adhere to a higher standard i accept that but my question is 
how much he said 
he then asked whether it is acceptable for members late in the 
evening who had a few drinks in hideaways to come onto the floor 
late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear 
deterrence or to accept speaking fees campaign contributions and 
paid vacations from special interests who have a vested interest 
in the legislative process

officials of south korea and north korea 
met at the border on thursday and resumed talks on a possible 
meeting between their prime ministers 
delegates from the two sides exchanged greetings at the panmunjom 
truce site and chatted for about 10 minutes before beginning formal 
deliberations 
last months talks bogged down after north korea demanded a halt 
to joint ussouth korean military exercises the pyongyang 
government repeated that demand wednesday 
north korea has said the talks cannot progress unless the team 
spirit exercises an annual event since 1976 are canceled 
the south koran authorities should first of all have a 
corrrect fundamental stand and attitude toward the dialogue and take 
a determined stand of discontinuing the team spirit joint military 
exercises at once north koreas official central news agency said 
in a report monitored in tokyo 
another factor that may affect the dialogue would be seouls 
blocking of dissidents from meeting with north korean officials on 
national unification wednesday 
south korean dissidents defying a government ban scheduled the 
meeting at the truce village of panmunjom but police overpowered 
and arrested 28 dissidents heading to the site 
before the feb 8 meeting at the border village of panmunjom 
hopes were high the countries would be able to agree on terms for 
the prime ministers meeting it would be the highestranking 
meeting ever between communist north korea and capitalist south 
korea 
despite the north korean demand military officials of the united 
states and south korea have made it clear they will not halt this 
years exercises 
seoul observers believe the hardened north korean stand also is 
expected to affect a scheduled meeting march 9 between sports 
officials of the two nations to form a single delegation to the 1990 
asian games in beijing 
its also believed north korea may be displeased with president 
bushs recent visit to seoul and last weeks defection to seoul of 
two north korean students 
while in seoul bush reaffirmed washingtons security commitment 
to south korea and said the united states would continue its 
military presence about 42000 us troops are stationed in south 
korea under a mutual defense treaty

eastern airlines struggled wednesday to avert a 
weekend machinists strike offering pilots sweeter pay job security 
and other promises if they sign a new contract and defy a walkout by 
fellow workers 
if the pilots and other employees support the picket line and 
dont show up for work eastern cannot survive frank lorenzo 
chairman of easterns parent company texas air corp said in a 
videotaped message sent to pilots of the unprofitable airline 
the pilots participation is considered pivotal to the success of 
the machinists strike which is to begin at 1201 am saturday 
unless there is a breakthrough in the unions 17monthold contract 
negotiations 
leaders of the pilots union have urged their 3500 members to 
honor machinists picket lines but indicated last week they would 
reconsider if management made contract concessions to them 
lorenzos message marked the most dramatic appeal yet by 
management to quell the latest in a series of labor crises that have 
afflicted eastern for years and have have helped bring it close to 
bankruptcy 
he promised a fiveyear pilots pact with pledges of no furloughs 
and offered other protections in the event eastern sought bankruptcy 
court protection or was merged into sister texas air carrier 
continental airlines the pact also offers 3 percent pay increases 
for 1992 and 1993 
the pilots union reacted skeptically and said close inspection 
showed little substance to lorenzos words 
in his videotape lorenzo made a fine theatrical performance 
the pilots executive council said in a statement to members dont 
be misled much work still needs to be done 
the council said the offer doesnt pledge job security and 
actually contains 64 million in concessions plus a demand that 
pilots drop longstanding grievances it said were worth an additional 
250 million 
the company has gone outside the normal bargaining process and 
directly to the pilots said ron cole spokesman for the eastern 
local of the pilots union we think this is just part of a 
continuing disinformation campaign designed to divide the pilots 
group 
the pilots master executive council went into special session 
wednesday afternoon in washington cole said 
in other developments wednesday 
a federal judge took under consideration easterns request to 
hire outside contractors to service 26 aircraft on the ground but 
did not say whether he would rule before the strike deadline 
attorneys for the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers said they were seeking a federal court order 
allowing machinists to picket other airlines with which the 
international union has contracts 
eastern employees reported receiving formal notification of 
possible layoffs and plant closings under the new federal 60day 
plant closing notification law 
eastern which says it has lost more than 1 billion in the past 
decade and is losing more than 1 million a day wants 150 million 
in wage concessions from the machinists who represent 8500 
mechanics baggage handlers and other ground services workers 
more talks were expected with the company on a contract 
addressing pilots demands for job security a longterm financial 
commitment to eastern and an agreement to keep eastern routes from 
being transferred to continental texas airs predominantly 
nonunion carrier 
we would hope the pilots would remember that lorenzos made 
agreements before and contracts mean nothing to him hes not to be 
trusted said frank ortis vice president of machinists local 702 
lorenzo earned a unionbusting reputation when faced with labor 
strife at continental in 1983 he filed for federal bankruptcy 
reorganization and got continental labor contracts abrogated 
eastern apparently would have to use management pilots and 
possibly recently hired pilots to fly if the pilots union honored 
the machinists picket lines the flight attendants union 
leadership has urged its 5900 eastern members to honor eastern 
picket lines 
in wednesdays court hearing us district judge c clyde atkins 
took under consideration easterns request for permission to hire 
outside contractors to service its aircraft 
eastern attorneys said 26 of its approximately 250 planes are on 
the ground awaiting service because of a machinists slowdown the 
company also reported incidents of vandalism 
los angeles television station kttv reported that eastern has 
contracted with outside companies including concerns based in hong 
kong costa rica and europe to service its planes during a strike 
elsinore aerospace companies of downey calif is among companies 
hired the station said 
eastern spokesman matell said the company wouldnt discuss strike 
contingency plans 
in washington attorney joseph guerrieri jr said the machinists 
were seeking an emergency declaration with the federal court to 
allow the unions members to picket other airlines that have 
contracts with the union 
they are northwest airlines usair trans world airlines united 
airlines and piedmont airlines a favorable court ruling could 
result in machinists honoring picket lines at those carriers he 
said 
aflcio officials have said they want their 14 million members to 
boycott eastern and continental and help the machinists in a strike 
the machinists said they will picket other airlines ships and other 
transportation services

israels army chief of staff on 
wednesday defended the policy of beating palestinian rioters but 
acknowledged that in many cases the individual soldier decides how 
much force to use 
lt gen dan shomron made the comments as he testified in the 
trial of four soldiers charged with manslaughter in the beating 
death of a 42yearold arab refugee last august 
it was the army chiefs most comprehensive explanation to date of 
a policy that prompted harsh foreign criticism after pictures of 
soldiers clubbing palestinians were seen on worldwide television 
he said beating as punishment was prohibited and force should not 
be used once a riot is over deterrence is not the goal 
overcoming violence is shomron said but when someone stops 
resisting thats a matter of opinion 
in another development wednesday soldiers arrested two 
palestinians who tried to stab and kidnap a jewish settler in the 
west bank the army reported 
an army spokeswoman said a car approached in a suspicious 
manner when a settler left his vehicle then two men jumped out 
and one tried to stab the settler while the other pushed him into 
the car 
the settler escaped and alerted soldiers who closed the area and 
erected roadblocks the spokeswoman said the palestinians abandoned 
their vehicle and fled on foot 
also wednesday anonymous telephone callers to a news agency and 
to an arab lawyer demanded the release of all palestinian prisoners 
held by israel in exchange for the release of an israeli paratrooper 
avi sassportas 21 has been missing since feb 16 when he 
disappeared on his way home to ashdod south of tel aviv 
shomron testifying before a threejudge military court said 
orders issued to commanders on feb 23 1988 regarding beatings 
outlined proper procedures 
the army has contended that beatings are necessary to subdue 
riots which have raged in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
since the palestinian uprising broke out dec 8 1987 
dispersing a violent demonstration must be done with force 
shomron said let us be clear these are not demonstrations over 
food subsidies but violent demonstrations that endanger the lives 
of our soldiers 
you can beat someone to prevent an incident disperse a violent 
demonstration or to stop someone who is resisting an arrest he 
said 
the three privates and a first sergeant are charged in the 
beating death aug 22 of hani shami 42 at the jabaliya refugee 
camp in the gaza strip they face maximum prison terms of 20 years 
if convicted 
earlier testimony said a stonethrower the soldiers were pursuing 
ran into shamis house and when shami tried to keep them out the 
soldiers broke the door down threw him to the ground beat him with 
a broom and kicked him 
an autopsy determined he died of a punctured lung and at least 
12 of his ribs were broken 
the courtrooms 50 seats were full wednesday and relatives of the 
defendants who served in the elite givati brigade were seated 
behind them final statements in the case are expected next week 
defense lawyer uziel atzmon repeatedly asked shomron precisely 
when beatings were legal and when they were not 
you are asking me about gray areas and asking for clear 
answers said shomron who spent 2 hours on the stand soldiers 
are told to use their own judgment how severe the situation is and 
how much force is necessary 
it is possible that these events will be seen as a deviation 
it shows how difficult the situation is 
i am responsible for the orders given but not for the actions 
of every soldier he testified i expect the soldiers will 
fulfill their legal orders 
if officers give orders to troops that are not legal it is no 
doubt proper to investigate these orders 
at least 387 palestinians have been killed in the uprising most 
shot to death in confrontations with soldiers and 17 israelis have 
been killed thousands of palestinians have been wounded or beaten 
six palestinians were reported wounded by israeli soldiers 
wednesday three in the west bank city of nablus and three at the 
khan yunis refugee camp in the gaza strip those wounded at the camp 
included an 8yearold boy shot in the chest arab doctors said

the wife of convicted spy jonathan pollard 
should be denied her request for independent medical care as well 
as her wish to be transferred from the federal medical center in 
rochester a federal magistrate recommended wednesday 
magistrate janice symchych also recommended denying anne 
hendersonpollards motions for further hearings medical furlough 
and removal of 24hour surveillance at the federal medical center 
hendersonpollard 28 who has several medical problems alleged 
in a lawsuit against the rochester facility that what she called 
inadequate care had amounted to cruel and unusual punishment she is 
serving two concurrent fiveyear prison terms on charges related to

indifference to her serious medical needs symchych said in 
rebuffing hendersonpollards request for an independent medical 
examination and treatment 
federal medical center warden joseph bogan she said should be 
commended for his efforts to sensitively balance the medical needs

they oohed and aahed at times square and the 
statue of liberty then gasped when the tour bus squeezed within 2 
inches of a truck as it maneuvered through manhattans clogged 
streets on wednesday 
the folks from bolan iowa were clearly a long way from home 
youll never run into this traffic in bolan said linda 
nydegger i like to visit but i sure wouldnt want to live here 
we wave at everybody they give each other the bird said 
daryl mccready comparing motorists in bolan and manhattan 
the entire population of bolans metropolitan area six 
bolanites and 10 from the suburbs had taken david letterman up 
on his offer to visit the big city 
letterman prompted by a staffer intrigued by bolan paid for the 
iowans to come to new york for three days and appear on his show 
late night with david letterman 
on the show letterman immediately tried to dig up the dirt on a 
town where everybody knows everybody and then some do you have a 
town slut he asked ruth hansen 73 if so when she comes up 
point her out 
mrs hansen a 50year resident chuckled at that she and 
bolans oldest resident agnes demaris 78 were interviewed during 
wednesdays taping of the show to air early thursday then letterman 
brought the whole town onstage 
letterman also put on the spot lori nydegger 23 a weekend 
resident who helped organize a standstill parade it doesnt move 
and spectators walk around it to celebrate the towns 100th 
anniversary three years ago 
so youre just here for the free trip letterman said as she 
blushed and shook her head lets string her up 
mrs demaris who is confined to a wheelchair said in an 
interview afterwards that she didnt want to make the trip because 
of her physical condition but the letterman staff insisted on the 
entire towns attendance 
when they told me the rest of them couldnt go if i didnt i 
decided i wouldnt make them people stay home because of me she 
said ill be tired tomorrow im going home on the morning flight 
but it was well worth it 
after the show the bolan residents headed off for dinner at a 
beefsteak charlies restaurant in manhattan courtesy of letterman 
its like a dream you dont want it to stop said duane 
abrahams who along with the others will each be paid 150 for 
appearing on the show weve had this red carpet treatment 
theyve just rolled it out 
the visitors planned to watch the show during a party they were 
planning for their hotel rooms at the mayflower hotel where they 
were staying 
at home friends were housesitting all the houses in bolan and 
the postbowling crowd at jjs tavern in nearby northwood was 
expected to linger longer than usual to catch the letterman show on 
the tv above the bar 
i dont think theres anybody in worth county that wont be 
watching it said diane vanhorn a secretary in the county 
sheriffs department 
on the manhattan tour which included a ferry ride to the statue 
of liberty a bewildered ms nydegger asked whats that when a 
car alarm went off for no apparent reason 
a few minutes later she heard a man cursing loudly also for no 
obvious reason as he walked on the other side of the street 
oh my she said they get kind of mad dont they 
her brother loren 17 said he was asked for money twice in 
one block 
im glad i grew up where i did he said 
in bolan there is an antique shop a methodist church and the 
bolan store inc which owns threefourths of the towns property 
and sells farm equipment and supplies the store is for sale 
each week about 30 people attend church services 
practically all the women are in the choir ms nydegger 
said they have to be or we wouldnt have one my brother rings 
the bell lights the candles and brings up the offering 
the 103yearold community at one time had as many as 75 
residents as well as a blacksmith a train depot lumber yards and 
stockyards a blacksmith shop and a creamery 
but the automobile changed everything and bolans population has 
remained relatively stable and small the last 20 years 
there were only five residents until chuck yanacheak moved into 
the community last october 
the other 10 of us are in the suburbs mccready said which 
isnt more than a block away 
the iowans rarely see motorists as they drive five miles through 
corn and soybean country to grafton which has a post office and 
mason city which is 22 miles away and has a mcdonalds restaurant 
its a twohour drive to minneapolis and 2 hours to des moines 
mccready said he and his neighbors are enjoying the trip even 
though they know some people are poking fun at them 
we have to laugh at ourselves too he said main street is 
720 feet long and it ends in a dead end in a corn field 
but he added when we see the mess and utter confusion of new 
york city i wouldnt sell my 88 acres for 88 acres in manhattan 
unless i could sell it and move back to peace and quiet

richard m daley fresh from his democratic 
primary triumph over mayor eugene sawyer rallied his forces 
wednesday for a threeway general election battle against a black 
alderman and a republican nominee still to be crowned 
daley son of the late sixterm political boss mayor richard j 
daley drew overwhelming white support tuesday and benefited from 
low voter turnout especially among blacks to oust sawyer a black 
former alderman 
the victory made chicago first among the biggest us cities to 
have a black incumbent mayor defeated by a white in an election 
daley a threeterm cook county states attorney now faces a 
thirdparty challenge in the april 4 general election from timothy 
evans a popular black alderman who has the support of jesse 
jackson and who also hit the campaign trail wednesday 
the outcome of the republican primary normally barely noticed in 
this heavily democratic city remained in doubt wednesday edward 
vrdolyak a white former democratic alderman and daley foe who 
launched a writein candidacy only a week ago claimed a victory 
that if upheld could cut into daleys core constituency 
with five weeks of campaigning ahead daley was up at dawn to 
greet commuters and tape a television appearance 
i think my fathers looking down upon me on a beautiful warm 
day in chicago very proud of me and most importantly proud of 
the type of campaign that i ran in the last three months reaching 
out to every community daley said on cbs this morning 
at a commuter rail station daley pledged to avoid racial 
divisiveness in the campaigns next phase im going to be vying 
for votes of everybody throughout this city and this is a city made 
up of the black community the white commmunity the asian the 
hispanic community 
he predicted a good clean election 
sawyer said his political career wasnt over but suggested he 
would not back daley or evans my general sense is that i will not 
endorse anyone he said i am thinking it through and ive got a 
lot of people to talk to before i decide 
with 2843 of 2911 precincts or 98 percent reporting daley 
had 481370 votes or 56 percent to 367919 votes or 43 percent 
for sawyer three other candidates shared the remaining democratic 
votes while the gop race between vrdolyak and dr herbert sohn was 
considered too close to call wednesday 
evans 45 previously sawyers chief black rival maintained a 
low profile during the primary campaign but he began campaigning 
wednesday at 645 am shaking hands with voters at an elevated 
train station and promising to crush the daley machine 
vrdolyak 51 had no formal appearances scheduled wednesday 
the chicago board of election commissioners said thursdays 
official canvass would determine the republican outcome 
with 96 percent of 2911 percincts reporting unofficial results 
gave vrdolyak 10711 votes or 45 percent to 10234 votes or 43 
percent for sohn two other candidates each had 5 percent 
the elections board estimated that 645 percent of the citys 
nearly 155 million voters went to the polls tuesday 
daleys primary triumph gave him an advantage in the general 
election a contest democrats have won without fail since 1931 
in washington democratic party chairman ronald h brown 
congratulated daley and offered his full support to the party 
nominee in doing so the first black chairman of a national 
political party broke with jackson whom he had served as convention 
manager last summer 
tough contests and hardfought politics are nothing new to 
democrats and certainly not to democrats in chicago brown said in 
a statement the emphasis for all democrats now must be on unity 
and conciliation 
daley proved his effectiveness as a political organizer winning 
broadbased support among white ethnics and hispanics in the 
primary but he must work to gain support in the black community 
analysts said 
if vrdolyak a slick campaigner and nemesis of the late mayor 
harold washington is declared the winner over sohn observers said 
the white vote in the general election could be split between 
vrdolyak and daley giving evans the edge 
washington became the citys first black mayor after winning the 
1983 democratic primary in which the younger daley and incumbent 
jane byrne split the white vote 
washington gained support from liberal whites and hispanics to 
repeat in 1987 becoming the first mayor since the elder daley to 
win reelection but he died in office without having annointed a 
successor touching off a war between sawyer and evans that caused a 
deep rift in the black community

riots broke out wednesday in the 
western slums despite martial law and a newspaper said more than 
200 people were killed in the caracas area alone in three days of 
violence over price increases 
at least nine people were reported killed on wednesday 
the newspaper el nacional said in its early thursday edition that 
more than 1000 people were injured and 2000 were arrested in 
caracas since riots triggered by a wideranging government 
austerity program began on monday 
the newspaper listed the names of 159 persons whose bodies were 
in the caracas morgue which it said was congested with corpses 
it said there was a high number of corpses in other caracas 
morgues 
the independent newspaper quoted unidentified police sources and 
gave no details 
government ministers maintained that calm had been largely 
restored to venezuela but they censored international tv broadcasts 
from caracas 
the army began to airlift food from the interior of the country 
to supply caracas residents running low on supplies as a result of 
rioting and looting 
sporadic gunfire could be heard just blocks from the associated 
press office as a 6 pm curfew fell over the city 
nicole mendoza a caracas resident said soldiers were piling 
people into jeeps and taking them away outside her building to 
enforce the curfew which was announced tuesday night 
fighting continued in petare a shantytown east of the capital 
and local hospitals were full of injured a parish priest said 
officials refused comment on numbers of dead or injured 
a witness reported that an army unit shot mobs sacking a food 
store in petare after loudspeaker appeals failed to stop the 
looting a doctor who lives in palo verde near petare told the 
associated press 
the doctor said four people were shot to death there was no 
independent confirmation 
the government called on workers to return to their workplaces on 
thursday saying violence was practically controlled 
most businesses were closed on wednesday before the curfew 
venezuelans jammed the few remaining open food stores which were 
guarded by soldiers 
police battled with snipers in nueva tacagua a shantytown in the 
hills west of caracas and broke up mobs of looters in catia also a 
slum to the west of caracas according to radio rumbo a local 
station 
an ap photographer said he saw at least four bodies of people who 
had been shot wednesday in catia 
in the chapellin neighborhood of caracas an elderly woman died 
in her apartment from a wild bullet fired during gunbattles between 
army units and residents of a nearby slum said eyewitnesses 
radio reporters said delinquents were trying to break into homes 
in guarenas about 30 miles west of caracas while homeowners were 
defending themselves with gunfire 
interior minister alejandro izaguirre acknowledged there had been 
fighting in the capital but said calm has been restored to the 
rest of the country 
president carlos andres perez declared martial law late tuesday 
saying the incredible tragedy of the violence threatened 
venezuelas consolidation of democracy 
i blame the authorities because we warned them we would need 
protection way in advance said spanishborn businessmen manuel 
taboada whose four shoe stores were sacked by the looters he 
estimated his losses and damages at 26 million 
bus fare increases of 30 percent to 50 percent and price gouging 
by drivers were the immediate cause of the riots but oil accounts 
for 90 percent of venezuelas export income and the economy never 
recovered from the plunge in world prices several years ago 
inflation is expected to reach 70 percent this year double the 
1988 level and the foreign debt is 33 billion 
perez in office only four weeks announced a sweeping reform 
package under pressure from international creditors it includes 
freeing interest rates doubling gasoline prices and letting the 
currency float which means higher prices for imports 
correspondents from spanish and west german television said 
stateowned television and telephone companies refused to transmit 
images of the violence overseas a government spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity said there had been restrictions imposed 
because televised reports of the disturbances were too crude 
it was unclear whether the censorship was connected to the 
imposition of martial law which prohibits public gatherings 
suspends the right to privacy and freedom of the press and permits 
detention without charge 
perez said industrialists and the venezuelan confederation of 
labor the most powerful labor group agreed to an acrosstheboard 
raise of 2000 bolivars a month or about 52 that would mean a 
raise of more than 50 percent for people on the minimum wage

a highlevel advisory group once seen as the 
best hope for crafting a bipartisan solution to the nations budget 
problems ended up deadlocked issuing a final report today that 
splits essentially along party lines 
the seven republicans on the national economic commission and the 
one democrat appointed by president bush endorsed the presidents 
pledge against raising taxes and praised his budget submission to 
congress calling it a workable plan for eliminating the deficit 
by 1993 
however the six democrats on the panel who were appointed by the 
congressional leadership signed a minority report calling bushs 
budget neither theoretically sound nor politically realistic 
the administrations 116 trillion spending plan for 1990 
rules out any discussion of additional revenues and relies heavily 
on harsh and disproportionate reductions in domestic spending the 
democrats said

premier was a cigarette designed for people who 
hate cigarettes a butt that didnt cause cancer that didnt cloud 
the air with smoke that didnt even dribble ashes 
it also didnt taste very good and that apparently is what made 
the planned billion dollar project go up in smoke 
on tuesday rj reynolds tobacco co announced that after five 
months of test marketing in missouri and arizona it had snuffed out 
premier because it has not achieved adequate consumer acceptance 
during its short life premier neither satisfied cigarette 
smokers nor placated cigarette haters despite its label it was not 
exactly smokeless it gave off a steamy vapor reminiscent of 
cigarette smoke

says rep chet atkins dmass if we are as sensitive as we 
are about health of american consumers this certainly looks like an 
outrageous double standard

gov mario cuomo signed a new agreement to 
buy the 54 billion shoreham nuclear plant for 1 and close it 
permanently but some opponents were skeptical saying shoreham 
continues to rise from the dead 
under the agreement the long island lighting co will sell the 
debtridden unused plant to the state which will dismantle it the 
plant which has been subject to repeated licensing battles since 
its completion in 1985 had come close to bankrupting the utility 
it is time to end this matter once and for all and turn our 
energies to new productive measures for long island and the 
state said cuomo in announcing the agreement tuesday 
unlike a similar agreement last year which was killed by state 
legislators cuomo predicted this deal would succeed because it 
largely bypasses the legislature

trains loaded with snow have been rattling

winter that wasnt and save an annual tradition 
a record warm winter threatened to melt away the holmenkollen ski 
festival which begins thursday so organizers hauled in 5600 tons 
of snow by rail at about 15 cents a pound to rescue the event 
snow costs about the same per pound as wholesale sugar said 
knut almquist secretary general of the association for promotion of 
skiing which has organized the annual festival since 1892 
last month was the mildest january ever recorded in oslo and 
southern norway state meteorologist oernulf fremming said january

warning many of your fellow citizens these days 
are quietly rooting for interest rates to keep rising 
though they may not noise it around theyd be happy to see the 
federal reserve continue to tighten credit even to the point of 
slowing economic growth and restraining the number of new businesses 
and jobs 
who are these antigrowth scrooges well chances are their 
numbers include at least some of your affable lawabiding and 
patriotic neighbors and maybe even you 
you would certainly qualify for inclusion in this group if for 
instance you have a fixedrate mortgage on your house which would 
be unaffected by any change in current interest rates and a chunk 
of your savings in a floatingrate investment such as a money market 
mutual fund 
a decade or two ago it was generally agreed that only a banker 
could love high interest rates while the costs of borrowing went 
up savers got little benefit since the government set limits on 
rates paid to depositors as in the fabled 5 percent savings 
account 
but in the modern world of deregulated finance all that has 
changed people who are fixedrate borrowers and floatingrate 
investors see their incomes rise as interest rates go up with no 
concomitant increase in their expenses 
this viewpoint is by no means a unanimous one families with 
floatingrate mortgages right now are bracing for a blow to their 
checkbooks the next time their monthly payments are recalculated 
the impact is even more immediate on borrowers who have flocked 
to the popular home equity loans in the past few years 
with much homeequity credit the interest cost goes up in 
lockstep with the prime lending rate which jumped a full percentage 
point in february alone 
also owners of longterm interestbearing investments such as 
bond mutual funds have seen the value of their principal eroded as 
higher rates have pushed bond prices lower 
holders of bank certificates of deposit meanwhile watch in 
frustration as the rates available on new cds climb well above what 
they are getting on existing deposits that wont mature for another 
six months a year or more 
still longterm rates have risen much less than shortterm rates 
in the past year or so 
in periods such as 1988 when shortterm interest rates rose 
while longterm interest rates remained stable the household sector 
did very well observed richard hoey chief economist at drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
this pattern has been modified but not eliminated by the rise 
in floating rate debt instruments such as mortgages and home equity 
loans in recent years 
as savers and investors get more and more experience with the 
vagaries of interestrate fluctuations the people who create and 
sell financial products keep devising new approaches to the 
situation 
the floatingrate cd in various forms is one prominent example 
in the banking world 
a case in point among mutual funds is the pilgrim prime rate 
trust an investment company sponsored by the pilgrim management 
corp of los angeles 
it is set up to seek a monthly yield that fluctuates pretty much 
in line with the prime rate by investing in pieces of floatingrate 
bank loans known in the trade as loan participation interests 
a possible drawback of this fund a 3 percent sales charge up 
front and an early withdrawal penalty for the first year after 
purchase make it more suitable for longterm investors than for 
people who like to move their money around rapidly with changing 
trends in interest rates 
in any case the creation of investments like these keeps the 
highinterestrate fan club growing all the time

its always been frustrating for the nations 
governors accustomed to being the bosses at home to come to 
washington and wind up as highprofile lobbyists 
that was so even before the federal money ran out 
but they keep coming conferring and urging their collective 
wisdom upon the white house and congress where it usually gains a 
polite hearing and little more 
the national governors association gets vip treatment black tie 
receptions audiences with the right people but the message from 
those people has become a warning dont look to the federal 
government for more aid to the states expect less because theres 
no money available here 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee told the governors that they will have to find ways to 
finance some of the programs that face federal budget cuts because 
washington is fresh out of cash 
secretary of transportation samuel skinner said state governments 
should anticipate increasing costs for the repair of dilapidated 
bridges the reconstruction of highways and the like 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine politely chided 
the governors for wanting it both ways 
youve got a number of policy statements here that call for 
increased federal spending and yet another one that calls for 
meaningful deficit reduction mitchell said 
actually the governors couldnt agree on a deficit reduction 
statement at the conference that wound up tuesday so they put it 
off until they meet next summer in chicago 
the associations task force on the federal budget was to have 
adopted a policy statement seeking freezes on military spending and 
on some domestic programs but with full funding for welfare child 
nutrition medicaid and similar programs those are programs state 
governments will have to finance if the flow of aid from washington 
is cut or curbed 
that proposal foundered on a dispute that mirrors the budget 
debate in washington democratic gov mario cuomo of new york the 
chairman wanted to build in provision for a federal tax increase as 
a last resort republican gov carroll a campbell jr of south 
carolina the vice chairman balked 
so cuomo stayed home and the governors dealt with less 
contentious matters worrying all the while that the budget crunch 
coupled with president bushs promise against new taxes will wind 
up pushing costs and eventually tax increases upon state governments 
they adjourned with no consensus on what to do about it gov 
gerald l baliles of virginia the association chairman said there 
must be investments in education highways and other basic needs 
invest now or pay later he said although he did not say who 
should get the bills 
the virginia democrat did say that if there are federal budget 
freezes the governors would ask congress to protect the safety 
nets under programs for americans in need presumably congress 
also would pay the costs 
iowa gov terry branstad incoming head of the association said 
that with the federal budget in trouble the states are going to 
have to take the lead on many of the major problems facing the 
country 
during the 1980s a large measure of the responsibility for 
governing in this country has shifted from washington down to the 
states said baliles 
president reagan wanted it that way reagan former governor of 
california came to the white house in 1981 calling for a new 
federalism that would make the states responsible for what had 
been federal programs the reagan plan also was to return to states 
the revenue sources with which to pay for those programs 
they got the first half 
during the era of reagan budget cuts the governors adopted a 
resolution saying they could accept the reductions but also that 
they would vigorously oppose any attempt to shift the cost of the 
programs involved to state taxpayers 
new administration old debate 
so too with the frustration level when lamar alexander was 
governor of tennessee and chairman of the association he said the 
governors should change their ways and operate as chief executives 
rather than trying to act like senators 
theres certainly a weariness on my part at coming to 
washington and trying to set federal policy said alexander who 
now is president of the university of tennessee 
it doesnt do much good anyway

a building falls on magician david copperfield 
during his latest special but whos worried 
the building collapse is the highlight of the magic of david 
copperfield xi the explosive encounter a special airing on cbs 
friday 
copperfield is handcuffed and sealed inside a safe on the fourth 
floor of the white house hotel in charlotte nc the 13story 
landmark built in 1924 is to be demolished by means of 
strategically placed explosives and wire cables that will cause it 
to collapse inward 
as a mozart melody plays the crew shuts copperfield in the safe 
sets the explosive timer and runs out of the building the building 
collapses and moments later copperfield appears from beneath a 
blanket on a steel plate 
magic or camera trickery 
copperfield was asked about suggestions that his spectacular tv 
feats such as making the statue of liberty or a jet airplane 
disappear are not true illusions but use camera tricks 
thats not true said copperfield as he watched a tape of the 
building collapse on a monitor in an editing room he had just 
arrived a few minutes before from nashville where he had been 
performing on stage 
i think a lot of magicians are jealous when i hear that its 
a compliment people ask me to say cure a headache i say im only 
an illusionist i always work in front of an audience there were 
40000 people watching when the building came down it was all done 
in one unedited camera shot 
besides the network is very strict they would never permit me 
to take advantage of the audience there are people who are funnier 
than me people who are better looking if you could do it with a 
camera they could use anybody 
it is the 11th special copperfield has done for cbs it features 
such new illusions as dancing ties and an origami box his guest is 
emma samms of abcs dynasty who participates in a levitation 
illusion 
i combine magic with a story and romantic music he said 
we use a lot of contemporary rock n roll from the pet shop boys 
to peter gabriel to sting 
its very important for me to keep my magic current its an 
art form that keeps growing if more of us were doing it youd see 
more transition in magic since im one of the few who gets exposure 
i feel a responsibility to guide magic into new areas 
as he talked the monitor in the screening room showed his various 
illusions 
he borrowed a necktie from a man in the audience and made it 
dance and drink milk through a straw while harry belafonte sang 
angelina 
the illusion using origami the japanese art of folding paper 
into figures begins with a small box penetrated by three swords 
copperfield pulls out the swords and unfolds the box until it 
becomes a large box a woman then steps into it copperfield folds 
it until it is small again he then reinserts the swords finally 
he opens the box again and when the woman emerges she is wearing 
different clothing 
emma samms and anyone who appears on my show must sign a 
secrecy agreement copperfield said even when i build the 
equipment for my illusions i give sections of it to different 
builders members of my crew have different tasks i do have 
illusion designers but i work out most of my own illusions they 
may suggest a different way to do it 
copperfield said he also has a project in which magic is used as 
therapy in hospitals around the world we teach magic to patients 
to help them regain dexterity he said 
for me for a long time magic was just a job i was in china for 
the illusion of walking through the great wall someone said look 
youre doing what you want to do and here you are in china i 
slapped myself on the face and ive been enjoying magic ever since

an amazing turnabout in american attitudes toward 
consumer credit is presenting alan greenspan with a monetary

greenspan chairman of the federal reserve has been tightening 
the money supply for nearly a year now but consumers continue to 
buy up a storm all but ignoring his efforts 
at least part of the explanation lies in the fact that as 
greenspan seeks to restrain the use of credit the private sector is 
going all out to make it available 
so comfortable are americans with easy consumer credit these 
days that a comparison with attitudes in the 1960s seems to span a 
century rather than just two decades 
back then a personal loan at a commercial bank might have 
involved a long application form an interview with a stonefaced 
loan officer and a wait of weeks while the banks loan committee 
considered your creditworthiness 
generally the specific reason for seeking the money had to be 
stated and if the reason given was bill consolidation some 
banks would insist on using the funds to make the payment themselves 
rather than trusting the applicant 
today you need not ask for money it is offered to you via 
credit cards by banks whose existence you had not known before and 
who obtaned your name from a purchased mailing list you deserve a 
line of credit they state 
should you accept the offer and maintain a record of ontime 
repayments you might hear from the bank again we enjoy doing 
business with people like you who pay on time they say we are 
raising your credit limit 
you neednt buy merchandise with your credit you are free to ask 
for cash and then to use at least some of it for regular living 
expenses money machines are placed so that your urge for credit can 
be indulged anywhere anytime 
if you remain a reluctant spender you are enticed with 
merchandise and prizes big banks today are in the retailing 
business offering cardholders insurance television sets travel 
arrangements and more at a discount 
the easy credit doesnt apply only to small items in the 1960s 
the idea of offering discount credit to car buyers probably wasnt 
even imagined today it is routine let alan greenspan do what he 
wants with interest rates the sellers of automobiles will give you 
a rate considerably below that 
in addition they might offer you terms that really are easy 
some of them are pulling back from those terms in recent months but 
there still are a lot of fiveyear car loans out there loans that 
might even outlast the car 
in most of these transactions there is no harsh grilling as 
there used to be in fact much of todays credit is offered 
accepted and used without there ever being a personal encounter 
its all done by mail and sometimes by phone 
even the house in which you live can be used as a line of credit 
thanks to the home equity loan as long as you have sufficient 
equity in your house and the ability to repay the money is 
forthcoming almost automatically 
well you say you could borrow on a house in the 1960s and long 
before that too of course but back then it was done mainly out of 
need you might even have pitied the pour soul who had to take out a 
second mortgage 
today the use of the house as a bank is entrenched it is 
considered smart to use your equity rather than letting it sit there 
idly your rich uncle sam makes sure you get the point by allowing 
you to borrow on the house taxfree up to a point 
these are some of the things you might consider when you try to 
understand how the american consumer continues to spend in spite of 
rising interest rates 
alan greenspan considers them which isnt to say that he and his 
colleagues on the federal reserve board know how to deal with them

tell eric robinson the date you were born 
and hell immediately give you the day of the week you first drew 
breath same with dates in the future hes a human calendar 
yet its only weeks since the 19yearold autistic savant 
mastered buttoning his own clothes allowing him to trade 
elasticwaisted trousers for his first buttonup levis 
eric will graduate june 2 from a special education program that 
has taught him the joy of work in an alien world by the time he 
earns his diploma eric hopes to have found a lifes work in numbers 
a recent issue of the viewmont high school newspaper dubbed eric 
the schools rain man he shares many traits with the movies 
title character but there are important differences 
erics calendar calculations and aptitude for figures dont make 
him a prodigious savant like raymond babbitt played by dustin 
hoffman but unlike babbitt erics mania for numbers and improving 
social skills let him hold down a job they loved him in trials at a 
video store and the school library 
tests show eric to be mildly retarded as well as autistic and a 
savant a mix that puts his promising quest for work in a post 
office or city library on a very uncrowded plane 
they are usually so incapacitated in other ways that their 
skill wont help them said dr edward r ritvo of the ucla school 
of medicine one of the countrys leading authorities on autism 
indeed those who knew eric when he was younger are surprised at 
his blossoming sociability greetings in the corridors are returned 
with a notsonervous hi and he has somewhat relaxed the 
obsessive routines and rituals that govern an autistic life 
i was worried because i had heard that they got worse as they 
got into adolescence and families had to decide what to do with 
them with eric just the opposite happened he just seemed to 
improve said candace robinson his mother 
hes just a huge success story for parents with autistic kids 
who normally feel isolated frustrated and believe its a burden 
that will never let up said cindy anderson erics special 
education teacher 
years ago andersons first autistic student spoke only in the 
secondperson and was prone to unpredictable rages that injured 
herself and others eric her third autistic pupil is the first 
savant and the only one to shine at the community vocational 
opportunities anderson arranges 
i think hes trying to understand peoples feelings she 
said its a very rote process a very mechanical process 
autism absorption in selfcentered subjective mental activity 
is a severe disorder present in four of 10000 births an 
overwhelming majority of them males its cause is unknown but 
evidence suggests chemical or structural abnormalities in the brain 
among its characteristics is a profound disability in forming normal 
human attachments or in showing or receiving affection 
eric stiffens up when hugged even by his parents and wont let 
on if hes sick or in pain 
a study by ritvo and others published in februarys american 
journal of psychiatry shows about twothirds of those with autism 
have some degree of mental retardation scoring below 70 on 
standardized iq tests 
only about 10 percent of autistic people fall into the savant 
category and far fewer of those are mentally retarded other 
studies show 
mrs robinson believes her son who hoards bus schedules and 
loves to read the phone books he gets at christmas performs his 
calendar gymnastics by visual rather than mathematical means 
i used to wonder if he was calculating dates but i really 
believe its a matter of having a photograph in his mind of our 
100year calendar i asked him dates in the 1800s the other day and 
he couldnt do it she said 
thats erics explanation too elicited in what is typically a 
onesided conversation with a stranger he nervously checks his 
watch every few seconds 
how do you figure out what day somebody was born i have a good 
memory 
what do you want to do after graduation have a job 
something with numbers yes 
hes a whiz at simple math and his memory for numbers is as 
convenient as it is vast he makes a great phone directory says 
brother dan 
i think about anything he sees hes likely to remember said 
mrs robinson who spent hours a few years ago making flash cards of 
multiplication tables only to have eric render them useless by 
memorizing the answers the first time through 
peggy graham manager of video usa in this salt lake city suburb 
accepted eric for an hour a days training on a twoweek trial 
basis he stayed for 1 years quickly memorizing the shelf code for 
every videocassette in the store and eventually mastering the 
computer to check in movies 
he was amazing with numbers graham said but it took him six 
months to routinely talk to other employees and much longer to pass 
time with customers i used to stand by the door and say eric 
you cant leave until you say goodbye to everybody he would 
finally mumble goodbye 
the emotional connection is the last to be made by an autistic 
child anderson said its so difficult to make people 
understand the excitement you feel when they finally start making 
that connection 
an earlier stint shelving books at the school library gave eric 
command of the dewey decimal system and friendship with the 
onceskeptical librarian he was far less avid about custodial and 
landscaping jobs and anderson believes absence of social 
interaction as much as numbers accounts for that today 
he reaches out to people his social habits are much more 
appropriate she said citing erics response to the death of a 
school administrators wife as expected eric affably recapitulated 
for the bereaved husband the obituary information from the newspaper 
but then he added im so sorry about your wife

six years after ronald reagan urged development 
of spacebased defenses that could make atomic weapons obsolete 
president bush is seeking to put his own imprint on the us nuclear 
doctrine 
the new president who has given his national security council 90 
days to come up with a plan is expected to shift emphasis from star 
wars to the deployment of a new generation of mobile missiles 
that is more than a cosmetic change returning us doctrine to 
deterrence instead of reagans radical vision of a world free of 
nuclear weapons 
senior administration officials have said in interviews with the 
associated press that bush does not want to shift direction so 
radically as to derail strategic arms reductions talks with the 
soviet union 
the talks are too far along for that said one top official 
who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
caution consistency and coherence are emerging as the credo of 
the new administration and the bushs first defense budget will be 
closely scrutinized to see how he translates rhetoric into reality 
in a speech last month bush offered few details beyond asking 
that defense spending be kept even with the inflation rate a 2 
percent cut from the request reagan sent capitol hill in january 
but more is involved than moving money from one program to 
another to in the presidents words insure that our capabilities 
and resources meet our commitments and strategies 
national security adviser brent scowcroft directing the nuclear 
doctrine review has described reagans nuclear policy as one of 
near total confusion 
scowcroft signaled where he is headed in a report that he drafted 
for the center for strategic and international studies before he 
joined the administration the report suggested staggered 
development of weapons started under reagan concentrating on the 
singlewarhead midgetman mobile missile rather than the 10warhead 
mx or the b2 stealth bomber 
bush postponed until april a choice between the mx and the 
midgetman pending completion of the review the chief of the 
strategic air command gen john chain jr opposed the midgetman in 
a jan 26 letter saying we cant afford it now a 
congressional estimate in 1988 put the cost of the midgetman at 
138 billion about three times the price of putting 50 mx missiles 
on mobile rail cars 
continuing all the weapons started by reagan would cost closer to 
400 billion a year than the 3088 billion requested by bush 
according to congress 
while congress and the administration have dickered for a decade 
on whether to deploy a mobile missile the soviets have fielded two 
the railmobile ss24 with 10 warheads and the roadmobile ss25 
with one 
mobile missiles help stabilize the nuclear balance because an 
enemy can never be certain where the missiles are and they can be 
moved many miles in the 20 or so minutes that it takes a warhead to 
reach its target according to scowcroft and other strategic 
thinkers 
that means neither superpower can be guaranteed victory in a 
surprise attack variations of that kind of deterrence have been at 
the heart of us nuclear doctrine a concept summed up in the 
acronym mad the belief that a nuclear attack by either superpower 
on the other would result in mutual assured destruction 
we have for 40 years relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to 
keep the soviet hordes at bay scowcroft wrote in a biting 
critique of the bargaining positions that reagan staked out at the 
1986 summit in reykjavik iceland 
if we do have a strategic concept that brings order to all the 
disparate actions and proposals of the administration of which 
reykjavik is a prime example it would be reassuring to know what it 
is scowcroft wrote 
in a 1983 speech reagan argued that technological advances made 
it possible to defend against intercontinental ballistic missiles 
that might allow the superpowers to eliminate their atomic arsenals 
said reagan borrowing a line from the antinuclear movement 
reagan vigorously pursued his call for a spacebased missile 
defense and said a decision on deployment would come in the 
mid1990s 
bush stopped short of that commitment and said last month that 
he will vigorously pursue the strategic defense initiative 
the center for strategic and international studies report with 
which scowcroft was affiliated struck a similar note although 
active strategic defense is a long way from negating deterrence 
based upon mutual vulnerability there is still an open question 
about the longterm advantages of largescale ballistic missile and 
air defenses it said these systems might eventually be worth 
the price of deployment beyond the year 2000 
defense secretarydesignate john tower has called reagans vision 
of a antinuclear umbrella unrealistic and for several years the 
scientists engineers and military officers assigned to carry out 
reagans research in the strategic defense initiative organization 
have aimed for a system to enhance deterrence by making some us 
systems harder to destroy 
lt gen james abrahamson who retired as head of sdio on feb 1 
argues that puts the united states on the same nuclear wavelength as 
the soviet union which he said never abandoned the doctrine of 
strategic defense and maintains an antiballistic missile abm 
defense system around moscow as allowed under the 1972 abm treaty 
the united states has no such system 
the soviets also maintain an extensive system of underground 
bunkers which the pentagon says are designed to protect the kremlin 
leadership in wartime and has hardened numerous military and 
industrial targets to help them survive a nuclear attack 
the central political objective of us nuclear policy is to 
deter aggression against the united states and its primary allies 
interests according to csis 
by contrast soviet nuclear policy has as its primary objective 
the deterrence of a us first use of nuclear weapons during 
crisis of war unlike the united states soviet writings and 
statements made primarily by military professionals convey strong 
preemptive overtones the csis report said 
reagans 1983 speech gave the soviets the impression that the 
united states was radically shifting its nuclear doctrine to a 
strategy of preemptive attack such a doctrine bolstered by the 
technological superiority of the west set off alarm bells in the 
kremlin 
the bush administration is sending signals that strategic 
defenses may be in the nations future but that for the time being 
deterrence remains the bedrock of us nuclear doctrine

buried deep beneath the village of sharapova southeast of moscow 
are bunkers designed to allow kremlin leaders to survive a nuclear 
war 
contrast those shelters with statements by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev that a nuclear war cannot be won and should 
never be fought and you face the imponderable dilemma of the nuclear 
age 
why do the superpowers have atomic weapons and how will they use 
them 
in the kremlin and at the white house the superpowers are 
reviewing their own nuclear doctrines national security adviser 
brent scowcroft is directing the us effort one that is expected 
to change the defense budget the shape of the us nuclear arsenal 
and american positions in arms control talks 
us and soviet theories on the use of atomic weapons have 
evolved over the decades from the construction of the first bombs 
in the 1940s until the widespread acceptance now that nuclear 
weapons are too dangerous to use in war 
we are profoundly devoted to the idea of a nuclearfree 
world gorbachev wrote in perestroika 
if the huge stockpiles of nuclear chemical and other weapons 
that have been accumulated are unleashed nothi brezhnev 
enunciated the tula doctrine which states that a nuclear can 
never be won and should never be fought that doctrine has been 
adopted by gorbachev 
but many red army officers writing in theoretical journals and 
training manuals argued otherwise leading many western analysts to 
conclude that soviet war plans included a possible first strike 
against the united states 
and many believed at the time that the soviets might use tactical 
nuclear weapons to try for an early victory during a war in europe 
a view that was buttressed by the deployment of mediumrange soviet 
ss20s in central europe in the late 1970s the ss20s are being 
destroyed under the intermediaterange nuclear force treaty signed 
by gorbachev and president reagan in december 1987 
the ss20 deployment which was criticized by soviet journalists 
like aleksandr bovin and reformist scholars in civilian thinktanks 
was part of a massive military buildup under brezhnev giving the 
soviets parity with the united states in nuclear weapons and near 
parity or superiority in conventional and naval forces 
the soviets now say they have adopted the new thinking of 
gorbachev and want to eliminate nuclear weapons by the end of the 
century 
but us officials say the soviets have made no move to dismantle 
their longrange nuclear forces or the bunkers where kremlin leaders 
could hide in the event of war 
the pentagon said in its annual report the soviet threat 
that the first bunkers were built 40 years ago and that yet 
another round of construction on these complexes began in the early 
1980s when soviet leaders were publicly emphasizing that a nuclear 
war would be so catastrophic that attempts to achieve victory or 
even seriously limit damage in such a war no longer made sense 
the bunkers are a manifestation of the old thinking said one 
of the thinktank scholars who is backing gorbachevs campaign to 
trim the military he asked that his name not be used because the 
bunkers are considered a statesecret 
yet many american critics of the pentagon are persuaded that the 
new thinking has taken hold in moscow 
john steinbrunner director of foreign policy studies at the 
liberal brookings institution in washington said the bunkers are 
not evidence of a duplicitous soviet nuclear doctrine rather he 
said they are similar in concept to the airplanes that the united 
states keeps at andrews air force base near washington waiting to 
whisk top leaders out of danger in the event of war 
there are very good reasons to have those bunkers in order to 
stabilize your command said steinbrunner if your central 
command can be eliminated by preemptive attack you can be knocked 
out 
soviet leaders have claimed that they developed nuclear weapons 
in response to such bombs in the us arsenal but the memoirs of 
soviet physicists published in the 1980s give evidence that the 
kremlin secretly sought to be the first to develop the bomb 
soviet work on the bomb began in the late 1930s through spies 
the soviet leadership learned in 1943 of the us manhattan project 
and ordered physicists to speed up their work 
after the united states dropped an abomb on hiroshima in 1945 
the soviets redoubled their efforts 
provide us with nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time 
you know that hiroshima has shaken the whole world the balance has 
been destroyed provide the bomb it will remove a great danger 
from us stalin told the physicists 
four months later the soviets tested their first bomb according 
to david holloway a scholar at stanford university and author of 
the book the soviet union and the arms race 
the united states nevertheless retained a significant edge in 
the number of weapons and means to deliver them unable to afford 
the cost of maintaining a full land army in europe the united 
states adopted the less expensive alternative of balancing soviet 
military might with nuclear weapons that remains the fundamental 
principle of us nuclear doctrine in europe 
although the red army occupied most of central europe after the 
defeat of nazi germany the american abomb denied them superiority 
on the continent 
during the cold war us and soviet politicians and physicists 
engaged in a game of geopolitical chess maneuvering to place each 
others cities military bases and allies at nuclear risk 
through the 50s and 60s the soviets struggled to keep pace 
with the us nuclear arsenal but were hamered because unlike the 
americans they did not have bases near their adversary on which to 
base bombers and missiles 
the launching of the first manmade satellite the soviet sputnik 
in october 1957 signaled that the russians had the means to build 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and helped prompt john f 
kennedy to warn of a missile gap during his successful 
presidential campaign in 1960 
in 1962 kremlin leader nikita s khrushchev tried to put soviet 
missiles within striking distance of the united states by deploying 
them in communist cuba 
the soviet failure in the missile crisis spurred them to achieve 
strategic parity with the united states

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter makes it 
plain that he intends running a tight ship through the stormy seas 
where trade barriers drought poverty and foreclosure lurk as 
monsters of the deep 
but yeutter also says he is not ready to keelhaul farmers and the 
rest of rural america at the first sign of a budget knife some 
things are done simply because its right to do so within limits 
we still have to have compassion for folks who get into 
economic difficulties in agriculture often through no fault of 
their own weather conditions for example like last years 
drought he says and we will probably want to continue special 
privileges to help out young farmers so that they can gain entry in 
this business 
yeutter had been asked to respond feb 24 at his first news 
conference at the agriculture department since joining president 
bushs cabinet 
the question was whether he agreed with a report by the national 
agricultural finance commission which recommended among other 
things that cuts be made in federal subsidies for agricultural 
credit 
farming the commission said is a business and not a way of 
life that should include government props for those who cant make 
it on their own 
i agree with the basic conclusion that farming is a 
business that ought to be handled in a businesslike way by 
everyone including the federal government and that we ought not to 
be running longterm welfarelike programs in agriculture yeutter 
said 
at the same time however we have to recognize that we can 
achieve that laudable objective only in a gradual way he added 
and only through cooperation of our trading partners 
thus yeutter shifted into the mode that he knows intimately 
after 3 years as president reagans trade representative he led 
the us charge against foreign barriers to free trade and still is 
a key player in the ongoing uruguay round of negotiations under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
for many years since a wheathungry soviet union blew the lid 
off us grain exports in the early 1970s many economists 
commodity groups farmers and politicians have held doggedly to the 
idea that foreign markets offer the potential for prying american 
agriculture out of its old ruts and dependence on federal programs 
one of the reason for federal subsidies is because our farmers 
and our marketers have to compete with subsidized products elsewhere 
in the world yeutter said 
if other countries agree to reduce their levels of subsidization 
the united states can do likewise and eventually trade distorting 
subsidies can be eliminated 
i put particular emphasis on the term trade distorting 
because lots of people here and abroad have misquoted me as seeking 
to eliminate all agricultural subsidies and i never said that 
yeutter said 
we can continue to provide income support to farmers as we deem 
appropriate and i suspect that we will be doing so for a long 
period of time simply because farming is a volatile business and it 
is going to be very difficult to reach a utopian situation where no 
assistance of any kind from the government level is required for 
american agriculture he said 
after his confirmation hearing on feb 2 yeutter provided the 
senate agriculture committee with 147 pages of answers to questions 
that he and the panel didnt have time to cover during the formal 
proceeding those will be hauled out regularly as debate unfolds in 
congress on various farm programs and proposed legislation 
for example sen tom harkin diowa asked yeutter about the 
future of agriculture and where fulltime commercial family farms 
are heading 
yeutter replied that the economic structure of agriculture is 
likely to continue evolving much as it has in the past with fewer 
and larger farm units harkin then asked about the federal role 
federal policies should provide assistance and support to the 
farm sector in a structurally neutral manner yeutter said in 
other words agricultural policies should be evaluated based upon 
their benefits and costs to the nation but their implementation 
should not be slanted to favor one economic structure over another 
yeutter added attempting to freeze a particular structure in 
place would inevitably reduce the efficiency of the sector over 
time the european economic community experience in agriculture is a 
classic example of this 
the indications now show that a family farm structure will 
continue to dominate american agriculture and i see no reason to 
tilt farm policies away from that he said 
harkin also asked about usda policies to help young and beginning 
farmers and whether small and mediumsized farmers should be helped 
to start and stay in business 
yeutter said policies should assure there are no artificial 
barriers to prevent entry to farming but care should be observed 
helping these folks to start farming is one thing yeutter 
said helping them to stay no matter what kind of managers they 
are is another the latter can be enormously costly to american 
taxpayers successful farmers are not enthusiastic about paying more 
taxes in order to assist unsuccessful farmers to hang on

lynn whitfields role as a successful doctor 
helps create the positive black family image in abcs heartbeat 
and yet shes eager to range from the mainstream to do controversial 
material 
shes one of the stars of the abc miniseries the women of 
brewster place the story of a group of poor black women which 
presents an unabashedly feminist view of the troubles they have with 
the men in their lives 
the fourhour miniseries which airs sunday and monday is based 
on a novel by gloria naylor and also stars oprah winfrey olivia 
cole robin givens jackee paula kelly lonette mckee phyllis 
yvonne stickney cicely tyson mary alice moses gunn douglas 
turner ward and paul winfield 
winfrey as mattie michael is the central character but the 
story of each woman is told the film is interesting and wellmade 
but it is antimale and black men in particular take their lumps 
with few exceptions the men are neerdowells who shirk 
responsibility and desert their women 
mattie is an unwed mother whose teenage son betrays her and 
causes her to lose her home ceil whitfield is abandoned by her 
husband after their child dies in an accident kelly and mckee play 
lesbians and when mckees character is raped by a street punk she 
takes out her rage on the nearest man the kindhearted building 
superintendent who befriended her 
im an actress who occasionally does material written by 
feminist black writers who give their impressions of black men 
whitfield when i did for colored girls who have considered 
suicidewhen the rainbow is enuf i was attacked outside the 
theater 
its a writers prerogative to write it as she sees it but i 
know for myself im ready to reinforce other ideas about the 
family i think its a tragic flaw in black literature and drama 
that so much responsibility is put upon the artist to present images 
that are positive its unfair to dump all the responsibility onto 
the artist 
on the other hand she said its not fair that there 
arent enough projects being done that cover a wide span of black 
life so any one project done takes on so much responsibility to 
present good images of our race 
she said now that she has begun writing she can assume 
responsibility for what i present 
she has written a treatment for a romantic mystery movie called 
passant blanc set in new orleans in 1929 and a presentation 
for a situation comedy 
whitfields role on heartbeat as dr cory banks would seem to 
come naturally she is the granddaughter of a doctor and the 
daughter of a dentist she grew up in baton rouge la where the 
leo s butler community center is named after her grandfather 
i feel so good when i play this doctor representing my family 
profession she said 
she recently helped select actor robert gossett a cousin of 
louis gossett jr to play her husband in the series 
im very proud of what were doing she said were not 
presenting a couple that is totally perfect we deal with our 
sexuality and our inner conflicts we dont make comment about what 
its like to be black in america i am a black person being there 
is enough i think we need to look forward and enforce the concept 
that we are equal 
america is a competitive society you elbow your way through 
as a black artist i cant think of a better time to be around 
ceil is not that different from cory whitfield says even though 
the only obvious similarities between the two would seem to be that 
each has a husband and child 
ceil is a woman who has the same desires as cory but without 
the education or the finances to manage it whitfield says she 
just wasnt programmed to move up in the system lucillia ceil 
turner is a classic case of coming from a broken home she was 
raised by her grandmother 
the most important thing for her was what she never had the 
solidity of a real home she was married to a man who had no viable 
trade or profession and wasnt equipped to make a good living she 
herself was not prepared to earn a living its a classic case of 
our socialpolitical system and how it works

the government agency that safeguards bank 
deposits is in the hotel and restaurant business its the phantom 
landlord of several office towers shopping centers polo grounds a 
sewage plant and a 78acre thoroughbred horse farm 
what does the federal deposit insurance co know about changing 
bedsheets flipping hotcakes treating sludge or saddling horses 
nothing 
the fdic inherited these properties after rescuing a spate of 
insolvent banks over the years and its now auctioning them off en 
masse to investors worldwide 
banking experts say the agency could be involved in many more of 
these auctions in the notsodistant future if president bushs plan 
for solving the nations savings and loan crisis proceeds as planned 
bush proposes to restructure the thrift regulatory system by 
giving the fdic the added responsibility of insuring sampls currently 
the job of the federal savings and loan insurance corp the change 
would pass on to the fdic the authority of handling repossessed 
thrift assets including real estate 
the federal asset disposition association a subsidiary of fslic 
says it alone manages 2400 fslic property assets in 33 states with 
an appraised value of 38 billion most the result of bad loans 
made by hundreds of failed thrifts over the years half of which 
were in the southwest among the properties a 497acre safari park 
in branson mo 
for now though the fdic has its own whiteelephant properties 
to contend with 
about 84 million worth or 20 percent of the fdics current real 
estate portfolio will be sold this thursday in a venture with the 
auctioneer christies and the real estate firm cushman amp wakefield 
the event marks the first largescale real estate auction for the 
fdic and only the second real estate auction for christies which 
is better known for pitching multimillion dollar art collections and 
rare jewels not empty motels 
arthur f lorentzen jr assistant director of the fdics 
division of liquidations said the agency previously had disposed of 
real estate holdings through smaller regional auctions or sealed 
bids sales he said the christies auction exposes the select 
properties to a wider range of potential investors 
on the block are 25 of the fdics largest properties located in 
alaska florida new mexico california tennessee and texas where 
bank failures have been increasing 
the auction targets range in value from a houston apartment 
complex worth around 650000 to a 23story office tower in 
knoxville tenn worth around 24 million 
a few had been owned directly by the problem banks while others 
were turned over to them as a result of loan defaults lorentzen 
said 
when banks fail the fdic steps in to protect the deposits then 
tries to sell some or all of the assets to a healthy institution 
sometimes it ends up with properties it doesnt want 
a record 217 banks failed in 1988 up from 184 the previous year 
with many of them victims of depressed economies in the agricultural 
and sunbelt regions some of the properties inherited by the fdic 
remain shut down such as the 172room skyway motel in st 
petersburg fla which the fdic received after local park bank 
failed on feb 14 1986 
others remain open for business like the 192room howard 
johnsons motel and restaurant in knoxville tenn once the 
responsibility of city and county bank which failed may 27 1983 
 
we dont run them ourselves lorentzen said we hire people 
to do that 
anything we have its our goal to put it back in the private 
sector our main function is to insure deposits 
the upcoming auction list includes about a dozen land parcels 
three motels two shopping centers 10 apartment complexes and five 
office buildings earl reiss executive vice president for cushman

barbara blodgett was in a coma when she gave 
birth to a healthy eightpound son in december nancy klein remains 
in a coma after her husband won the right to abort her 18weekold 
fetus in february 
the number of pregnant women who go into a coma each year is 
small doctors say and many questions remain about how a pregnant 
womans coma affects the fetus and how a fetus affects the recovery 
of its comatose mother 
thats why simon alan blodgetts birth was so unique and why 
martin klein fought for an abortion hoping to improve his wifes 
chances of recovery 
there are no accurate statistics but three large us trauma 
centers report a total of about 20 cases of pregnant women in comas 
over two years doctors at all three hospitals agreed that in most 
cases the coma ends and the woman goes home and has a healthy baby 
with severe head injuries most fetuses abort naturally are aborted 
to help the mother or die in childbirth 
there is a very high incidence of spontaneous abortion that 
occurs in these cases said dr robert white of case western 
reserve university and director of neurosurgery at metropolitan 
general hospital in cleveland one of the largest trauma centers 
out of this group they either spontaneously abort or after a few 
weeks they go home to deliver 
in perhaps one comatose patient a year is a birth even attempted 
and white said he could not remember such a birth ever being 
successful at the hospital the mother often begins to unravel 
medically forcing doctors to try for a premature birth he said 
there is not a lot of research in this 
doctors at university hospital in seattle said simon blodgets 
birth was only the fourth successful delivery from a comatose mother 
they could document in medical history 
dr madhura patel of baylor college of medicine in houston who 
specializes in treating head injuries to pregnant women has seen 
only seven such cases in two years several patients recovered with 
fetuses intact but in one case of an unmarried teenager who was 
five weeks pregnant the girls father ordered an abortion because 
his daughter was unlikely ever to be able to care for an infant 
the mother subsequently woke up from the coma but continues to 
be impaired she has no memory of the fact of ever being pregnant 
mrs blodgett 24 of yakima suffered brain stem injury in a 
traffic accident june 30 when she was three months pregnant after 
initial reluctance family members say a seattle hospital accepted 
her doctors held out little hope of improvement but shortly after 
simons dec 9 birth she began regaining consciousness and was well 
enough to return home in midjanuary 
she has made steady progress and has limited use of one arm 
allowing her to cradle her newborn and point to letters to spell 
words last week she began intensive rehabilitation at st 
elizabeths medical center in yakima and in a unique challenge 
has vowed to walk and talk before her newborn 
no one knows exactly why blodgett came around after the birth 
although one doctor speculated that hormonal changes triggered a 
return to consciousness 
family members feel she was conserving her energy for the fetus 
after she had the baby it was a signal for her to go husband 
david blodgett jr said after she had the baby she concentrated 
more on herself 
the family never had a lot of hope from any doctor blodgett 
said but always had faith she would recover we spent so much 
time with her that you could see the small things she did 
martin klein had no such hopes he successfully battled 
antiabortion activists to win a court order allowing the abortion 
which doctors said could aid his wifes recovery mrs klein 32 
remains in a coma at north shore university hospital on new yorks 
long island

japan threatens us dominance in finance just 
as it has in cars and computer chips the president of the chicago 
mercantile exchange says 
the threat of competition from japan was the driving force behind 
the mercs decision to institute 24hour worldwide electronic 
trading through its globex system merc president william brodsky 
said at a conference tuesday 
the japanese are something that no one ignores in the world of 
industry or finance he said in an interview 
the japanese who once scorned innovative usinvented 
securities products such as stockindex futures have begun 
electronic trading in tokyo and osaka of stock and yen bond futures 
and soon will begin trading yen currency futures in competition with 
chicago 
the desire to keep business executed through chicago was behind 
the mercs development of globex in conjunction with reuters 
holdings plc the system in which investments are traded on a 
computer screen is scheduled to begin in october 
an australian exchange and the new york mercantile exchange 
which handles oil futures have said they also will list contracts 
on globex 
innovation of this type is essential if the us is to maintain 
its leading competitive edge and remain a leading provider of 
financial services to the world community wendy gramm chairwoman 
of the commodity futures trading commission said when the federal 
agency approved globex on feb 2 
david ruder the chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission has called globex the wave of the future 
the race to roundtheclock trading faster computers and 
instantaneous global communication poses a challenge to regulators 
such as the cftc as well as to an older generation of traders 
one eventual victim of modernization could be the local traders 
on the floor of the chicago merc and the chicago board of trade 
some of whom are being investigated for allegedly cheating their 
customers 
some outsiders have predicted that globex will undermine the 
mercs chaotic but timehonored open outcry trading system 
brodsky denied that tuesday saying facetoface trading in the 
pits has advantages over faceless electronic trading which will be 
prohibited during the mercs regular hours 
why are we here today in a room when we could all be on speaker 
phones in our offices he asked at the conference 
brodskys comments came on the second and final day of a 
conference on technology and the financial markets sponsored by the 
annenberg washington program and northwestern universitys kellogg 
graduate school of management 
in another session harvard university economist lawrence h 
summers spelled out a proposal for a tax on stock trading to 
discourage socially wasteful market speculation 
a halfpercent tax could raise 10 billion a year without doing 
any damage to the stock markets basic functions said summers who 
was the chief economic adviser to michael dukakis the losing 
democratic presidential candidate 
summers was disputed by louis i margolis a managing director of 
salomon brothers inc and by sanford grossman a princeton 
university economist 
grossman said it was unfair to single out the securities industry 
for a tax

billionaire developer donald trump sums up his 
philosophy as never think of the negative all obstacles can be 
overcome but there are some things that even the seemingly 
invincible trump who plans to acquire eastern airlines threecity 
shuttle service cant control 
the bitter escalating labor dispute at eastern as well as 
pending litigation by eastern unions against the shuttle sale have 
thrown a monkey wrench into trumps planned debut in the airline 
business 
the 2year rivalry between eastern and pan am corp in the 
lucrative northeast shuttle business is expected to intensify when 
the flamboyant trump completes his 365 million purchase of the 
eastern shuttle 
despite the gathering storm clouds at miamibased eastern trump 
and eastern officials say they hope to close the deal sometime this 
month and the heads of both shuttles say theyre gearing up for 
fierce competition waged on the battleground of service 
the two hourly shuttle services used mainly by business 
travelers link new york with boston and washington for both 
eastern and pan am they are profitable units in an otherwise bleak 
financial landscape 
but trumps takeover has been complicated by the strife at 
eastern 
as a friday strike deadline set by the airlines machinists union 
approaches hope is fading for a lastminute settlement of the 
16month contract dispute on friday the national mediation board 
recommended that president bush declare a presidential emergency a 
move that would at least delay the walkout for 60 days 
observers speculate that if there is a strike employees of the 
trump shuttle all of whom are currently with eastern could walk 
out in sympathy with their former peers after the close of the 
shuttle deal planned for sometime in march 
bruce nobles the president of the trump shuttle said his 
company has recognized the eastern unions as valid bargaining 
representatives for trump shuttle employees trumps team plans to 
negotiate separate agreements with those employees sometime before 
or after the sale is completed he said in an interview 
if there is a strike against eastern we dont know what the 
impact on us would be said nobles the former president of pan 
ams rival shuttle 
the uncertainty created by easterns labor situation along with 
union litigation contesting the sale of the shuttle to trump could 
even force eastern to sell the service to the developer at a lower 
price one analyst suggests 
eastern is so hungry for cash said farrell kupersmith a 
financial consultant to the air line pilots association who works 
for touche ross amp co in miami he said that frank lorenzo the 
chairman of easterns parent company texas air corp needs cash 
desperately and might knock 25 million to 50 million off last 
octobers agreed purchase price of 365 million 
but nobles and some analysts dismiss that idea as mere conjecture 
trump may bargain for labor peace by offering his shuttle 
employees higher wages than what lorenzo is willing to pay 
suggested kevin murphy an airline analyst for morgan stanley amp co 
murphy calls speculation however the notion that trump is 
backing away from the shuttle acquisition 
if and when trump completes the deal observers agree that the 
shuttle showdown between the real estate tycoon and pan am will 
hinge on service not fares 
it will be a highly competitive environment between the two 
shuttles said paul karos who follows the industry for first 
boston corp its going to be a service battle 
trump has said he plans to spend tremendous amounts of money 
to upgrade the eastern shuttle whose fleet of aging 
blueandsilver boeing 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned with 
red black and gold stripes as well as trumps name on their tails 
harris herman chief operating officer of the pan am shuttle 
said his team will continue to add services geared toward the 
business traveler that he concedes could be matched by trump pan am 
recently launched an advertising blitz calling its shuttle the 
corporate jet and emphasizing services such as inflight telephones 
the average shuttle passenger takes 10 round trips a year on the 
service and earns 115000 annually according to eastern the 
oneway weekday fare is 99 
the shuttle market basically is pretty priceinsensitive

premier rjr nabicso incs smokeless 
cigarette was dead on arrival because of its unpleasant taste 
industry analysts said but they predicted the failure wont 
forestall other cigarette innovations designed to counter complaints 
about smoke 
everyone i know who tried it thought it was really horrible 
said pavlos m alexandrakis who follows tobacco companies for argus 
research corp in new york 
rj reynolds tobacco co rjr nabiscos cigarette subsidiary 
announced tuesday that it was withdrawing premier from the market 
after five months of testing in two states 
while smokers are very interested in the concept the current 
product has not achieved adequate consumer acceptance the company 
said in a statement from its winstonsalem nc headquarters 
this is no surprise said industry analyst emanuel goldman 
it was brought out stillborn 
goldman who works for painewebber inc said premier suffered 
from two fatal problems unacceptable taste and aroma 
what the company was saying was consumers will get used to it 
theyll give it an extra try he said thats inconsistent with 
the fact that we are a nation of channelhoppers and if you dont 
like it the first time youre not going to try it a second time 
smokers also found premier hard to keep lit and werent sure 
what to do with the cigarettes when they were finished since 
premiers dont burn down like ordinary butts said analyst lawrence 
adelman of dean witter reynolds inc 
i thought the project initially was revolutionary in concept 
he said i think rjr nabisco was very bold but the technology 
wasnt there yet to satisfy consumer requirements 
premier differed from ordinary cigarettes in that it didnt 
actually burn tobacco instead smokers lit a carbon heat source at 
the tip during inhalation hot air passed passed over an 
aluminumencased flavor capsule and dried tobacco 
despite its innovations premier didnt eliminate health 
concerns several health organizations including the american 
medical association last year asked the us food and drug 
admininstration to ban sales of the cigarette 
several analysts speculated that the timing of premiers demise 
was due to the buyout of rjr nabisco earlier in february by kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co the new york investment firm needs to cut costs 
at rjr to pay off the debt it took on in the record 2453 billion 
takeover 
but others said premier was doomed no matter what 
i think the consumer reaction was so negative that it pretty 
much was a foregone conclusion adelman said 
kkr did not make the decision to drop premier said betsy annese 
an rjr tobacco spokeswoman it was a decision by the tobacco 
companys management she said and they just agreed with us 
adelman said rjr spent about 200 million developing premier and 
an additional 125 million to launch the product in the test 
markets rjr had said it expected it would cost 1 billion to roll 
out premier nationwide 
reynolds said it had no plans to reintroduce premier or a similar 
product unless we have fully addressed the issues raised in the 
test markets 
ms annese said research on premier led to much spinoff 
technology including some aspects of two brands recently put in 
test markets vantage excel and chelsea 
vantage excel has a new tobacco blend and special highporosity 
paper that give off less litend smoke than ordinary cigarettes 
chelsea has a distinctive aroma that is being marketed as being less 
objectionable to nonsmokers 
we have learned an awful lot that will be helpful ms annese 
said we do not consider this to be a failure 
analysts said rjr and other tobacco companies have other projects 
in the works to reduce the smoke cigarettes emit the primary cause 
of smoking restrictions and complaints from nonsmokers 
adelman said some companies are looking at a change in the way 
tobacco is packed into cigarette casings goldman said the biggest 
innovation may come from biotechnology which may provide new 
strains of tobacco lacking many of its undesirable characteristics 
the 1990s are likely to be a period of technological 
breakthroughs in cigarettes providing you dont have an 
advertising ban goldman said he said a ban on cigarettes 
advertising would prevent companies from successfully launching new 
products

madison avenue ad agencies long have ignored 
the gay community in their marketing plans but a new nationwide 
study portrays homosexuals as dream consumers 
the report by simmons market research bureau of new york 
commissioned by a marketing firm that represents 125 gay 
publications found gay men in general have higher than average 
incomes higher education levels fewer dependents and a large 
amount of discretionary income that can be spent on luxury goods 
the survey basically validates what weve known all along and 
puts quantitative figures on it said joseph di sabato president 
of new yorkbased rivendell marketing co which paid for the 
survey the gay market is economically a dream market 
the report questioned 4000 readers mostly male of gay 
newspapers in eight of the nations top urban markets it asked them 
about their lifestyle and spending habits including buying patterns 
in travel liquor electronic equipment and apparel 
di sabato who says marketing companies have largely ignored the 
possibility of targeting gay consumers said monday he plans to use 
the surveys findings to urge national advertisers to place their 
messages in more gay publications 
the simmons survey completed in october and released this week 
by rivedell found gay men had an average annual income of 36800 
more than triple the national average of 12287 as reported in 
march 1988 census figures 
it also found the annual income of a gay household was 55400 
compared with a national average of 36500 
sixty percent of gay men are college graduates compared with the 
average of 18 percent for consumers in general about 35 percent of 
homosexuals also have some type of postgraduate education 
fortynine percent of gay men hold professional or managerial 
posts compared with about 16 percent of the population at large 
while gay men are 50 percent less likely than the population at 
large to own their primary residence they are twice as likely to 
own vacation homes 
gay men also are twice as likely to travel than those in the 
general consumer market and seven times more likely to go to europe 
than the rest of the us population 
di sabato said the buying habits of lesbians are not as easy to 
calculate because of the relatively few major publications expressly 
addressed to them 
we have been selling the legend of gay high income high 
education the low number of dependents and the large amount of 
discretionary and disposable income spent on highticket items 
like travel and imported alcohol di sabato said but other than 
the legend there was very little to back it up 
di sibato said the few national companies that have tried 
targeting gay consumers have been rewarded 
remy martin cognac has done ad campaigns in the gay press 
six weeks prior to christmas and in june prior to gay pride week 
nationwide and it has paid off for them di sibato said

the us sprint communications co is 
expected to sign an agreement to buy a major stake in a 
transatlantic cable that could boost its international 
telecommunications business a trade publication said this week 
the trade journal telecommunicationsweek said an agreement 
would be signed early this month under which us sprint would acquire 
private transatlantic telecommunications system inc of mclean va 
the trade journal did not disclose the financial terms of the 
proposed acquisition 
private transatlantic is installing a transatlantic fiber optic 
cable in a joint venture with cable amp wireless plc of london a 
longdistance company each company owns half of the venture 
officials at us sprint based in kansas city declined to comment 
on the report us sprint is the countrys thirdlargest 
longdistance telephone company 
paul woodrow a spokesman for cable amp wireless in london said 
his company had been talking with several big companies about 
selling a stake he declined to identify the companies 
about half of us sprints overseas calls are transmitted on a 
transatlantic analog or copper wire cable the rest are 
transmitted by satellite 
fiber optic cables transmit calls digitally by using impulses of 
light analog transmission an older technology is more subject to 
distortion 
analysts said that in addition to using the new cable system for 
its own calls us sprint could lease transmission services to other 
longdistance companies 
if the deal is completed as rumored it would be a very 
positive event for us sprint said joel gross an analyst with the 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp in new york 
not only would it make the company money but it would give 
them much better access within the european community which is 
important because international longdistance telephone service is 
growing about 24 percent a year more than double the domestic 
rate gross said

a partnership between zenith electronics 
corp and the american telephone and telegraph co could give the 
united states an edge in the global race to dominate the 
highdefinition television market zeniths chairman says 
zenith and atampt announced tuesday they were joining forces on a 
24 million effort to develop a processorreceiver and other 
hardware needed to bring highdefinition tv which produces clearer 
brighter pictures to the mass market 
separately zenith announced a 215 million program to develop 
picture tubes for highdefinition tv sets 
pearlman said the successful completion of the two projects would 
yield real winning american technology that will allow the 
us to leapfrog the japanese and europeans in the massmarket 
development of highdefinition tv 
zenith based in this chicago suburb and new yorkbased atampt 
said they would spend 11 million and were seeking a 13 million 
federal grant from the government to finance the 
researchanddevelopment project they said it was the first time 
two us companies have combined on a major highdefinition tv 
research project 
last month 16 us electronics companies said they were 
considering banding together to compete in the highdefinition tv 
market but they have not yet announced such an agreement 
the pentagon has indicated it wants to help finance the 
development of highdefinition television because of its potential 
military applications and is seeking grant proposals 
by combining atampts integratedcircuit technology with zeniths 
television expertise the companies hope to develop equipment for 
evaluating and demonstrating zeniths prototype highdefinition tv 
transmission system 
the us highdefinition television transmission standard 
prescribes 1125 horizontal lines per screen more than twice as 
many as the 525 lines per screen on todays televisions permitting 
superior pictures 
zenith also announced a 215 million program to develop 
largescreen versions of its flat tension mask highresolution 
picture tubes for military and consumer highdefinition tv displays 
taylor said the company has used the tubes which currently 
measure 14 inches diagonally in its computers for the last two 
years 
zenith the only major usowned producer of television sets and 
picture tubes said it was seeking 10 million from the government 
to complement its 115 million commitment to the picturetube 
research program 
industry analyst james magid of needham amp co in new york called 
the zenithatampt partnership fantastic 
they should have a lot more partners than that magid said 
this is a very big and important project 
zenith spokesman john taylor said the zenithatampt arrangement 
certainly wouldnt preclude us from teaming with others 
the market for highdefinition television including production 
equipment and receivers is expected to reach tens of billions of 
dollars a year by the early years of the 21st century

the average original television commercial aired 
in 1987 cost 145600 to produce according to a benchmark study by 
an advertising agency group 
the backers of the study say the methods developed for its report 
will give the ad industry a recognized standard against which it can 
measure from year to year what is driving commercial production 
costs 
in the past advertiser agency and media groups often have come 
up with widely differing estimates of production costs 
the american association of advertising agencies said its latest 
report was based on a computerized study of production costs for 
2042 commercials submitted by 22 ad agencies 
the average production cost is 278 percent more than the 
113940 average that the same group reported 1986 although people 
involved with both surveys said no comparisons between the reports 
should be drawn because of the changes in how the latest data were 
compiled 
they said the new report also should give advertisers more 
comparative information than they have ever had on how their 
commercial production costs compare with the average for companies 
in the same business or doing the same types of ads 
it found for instance that commercials for fast food snacks 
beer and soft drinks were on average nearly twice as expensive to 
make as ads for toys and recreation 229800 compared with 117500 
commercials produced for national advertisers averaged 156600 
to produce while those for regional advertisers averaged 102000 
and local ads cost an average of 56900 the study said 
the report said commercials that featured interviews or 
testimonials were the cheapest to produce at an average cost of 
76300 while those using song and dance productions were the most 
expensive at 277700 
commercials using special effects averged about 188000 those 
with animation cost 113400 and those featuring a simple shot of a 
product while an unseen narrator spoke cost 101900 
the average industrywide production company costs were 97400 
per commercial accounting for the bulk of the total costs the 
survey said 
the rest of the costs came from items such as performing talent 
editorial and postproduction work music and travel for the 
admakers 
the big news here is that we finally have a way from 1987 on to 
use the same critieria in measuring commercial costs said george 
bragg the lintasnew york ad agency executive who headed the study 
team 
over the past few years several trade groups including the 
association of national advertisers and the television bureau of 
advertising have attempted to estimate average production costs 
but the results have varied widely 
the advertiser group for instance estimated production costs 
averaged 124930 in 1985 but the television bureau said its survey 
showed costs averaged less than 40 percent of that amount 
even the figures that the ad agency group came up with in recent 
years are no longer comparable with the latest survey findings 
bragg said 
we are using an entirely different data base and different 
criteria for gathering information he said 
he said the 1986 study included information from a number of 
smaller agencies that were not included this year 
but he said he expects to have figures for 1988 ads that are 
comparable to the 1987 figures by midsummer

the federal deposit insurance corp is drafting 
regulations that would require banks and savings and loan 
associations to get its approval before seeking socalled brokered 
deposits in their efforts to expand 
many experts have contended that the deposits put together by 
brokers in 100000 blocks the maximum insured by the government 
at abovemarket interest rates and then loaned out for highrisk 
ventures such as shopping centers caused some sampls to sink into 
insolvency as the loans went bad 
fdic chairman william seidman told the senate banking committee 
on tuesday that the regulations would be proposed very shortly 
agency officials said the regulation initially would apply only 
to the 8000 banks that the agency supervises until congress 
completes legislation proposed by president bush that would put sampls 
under fdic jurisdiction 
but seidman said it would apply to sampls then as well and 
officials said that they expect congress to act on president bushs 
sampl bailout package well before the fdic can issue the new brokered 
deposit regulations in their final form 
under the proposal any bank or savings institution seeking to 
increase its loan portfolio by more than 36 percent a year through 
the use of brokered deposits or any other means would have to get 
prior approval from the fdic officials said 
for the past two years the fdic has been requiring banks to 
submit quarterly reports on their brokered deposits but regulators 
said that is an afterthefact reporting requirement only 
the new regulation they said would give the agency preemptive 
authority to stop a bank or sampl from seeking such deposits if 
officials believed they were going to be used to finance overly 
risky ventures 
they wouldnt be allowed to grow by using high deposit rates 
like that unless they could show they had a good use for the 
money seidman said after the committee hearing 
in the three weeks since bush announced his sampl bailout plan and 
the fdic has taken supervision over 36 insolvent savings 
institutions the agency already has stopped one of them in houston 
from seeking more brokered deposits an official said 
after congress deregulated sampls in the early 1980s many of them 
particularly in texas california and florida with their more 
lenient banking laws grew severalfold in size through the use of 
brokered deposits 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in testifying before the 
banking committee last week had defended the use of brokered 
deposits saying they provided many sampls with liquidity that they 
otherwise wouldnt have had 
but greenspan acknowledged that the highinterest deposits had 
created a spiraling effect that contributed to the current sampl 
crisis and he said he felt uncomfortable about them in some 
instances

many states are doing too little to tackle 
major environmental issues including solid waste disposal water 
quality and protection of food supplies according to an 
environmental group that conducted a national survey 
renew america a private environmental and conservation 
organization gave top ranking tuesday to california and oregon 
among the 50 states with tennessee and louisiana at the bottom of 
the list 
but the group whose survey examined state efforts to deal with 
five environmental problem areas said that overall there still is 
too little bele environmental problems on the state 
level 
aggressive state initiatives to protect the environment remain 
the exception and not the rule said scott ridley who directed 
the survey in many cases states are forced to make haing done to tackrd 
budget 
decisions with environmental protection losing out added tina 
hobson the groups executive director 
in other cases a state excelled in one area that was examined 
but fared poorly in others 
for example maine was given the highest mark for dealing with 
water quality issues but was ranked well below average in forest and 
land management and average in protecting food quality 
while oregon was second only to california in the overall 
ranking in drinking water 
quality maine food safety iowa dealing with growth oregon 
the survey ranked the states numerically with 50 being the 
highest possible when examining state actions undertaken to deal 
with the five areas examined 
in the overall ranking which took into account state efforts in 
all five areas the top states were california 42 oregon 39 
minnesota 38 massachusetts 37 wisconsin 37 iowa 34 new 
jersey 34 florida 32 maryland 32 connecticut 30 and 
washington 30 
the states with the lowest ranking were louisiana 10 
tennessee 11 utah 12 south dakota 13 arkansas 13 nevada 
14 wyoming 15 west virginia 15 kentucky 15 and indiana 
15 
the report said the states with the best overall program aimed at 
protecting drinking water were maine massachusetts new jersey 
california and north carolina the states with the worst record were 
arkansas nevada ohio tennessee and louisiana 
the study said there continue to be substantial gaps in the 
monitoring of harmful chemicals in foods although some states 
have taken on a growing responsibility to protect food supplies 
especially in monitoring for pesticide residues 
it said the five states with the best programs for food safety 
were iowa california minnesota south carolina and wisconsin the 
states with the worst programs were nevada indiana west virginia 
utah louisiana and wyoming 
the report cited increasing concerns about the growing garbage 
problem but noted that only eight states so far have comprehensive 
recycling programs and only 10 have laws requiring at least some 
recycling of waste products 
the states given the best marks for dealing with solid waste 
disposal issues were oregon connecticut florida iowa illinois 
minnesota new jersey new york pennsylvania rhode island and 
wisconsin those with the lowest marks were mississippi south 
carolina and arizona 
the study said oregon california wisconsin massachusetts 
florida new york new jersey and minnesota had the best programs 
for dealing with the impact of growth states with the poorest 
programs were arkansas mississippi and west virginia 
the report said only seven states have enacted laws that attempt 
to protect forests by balancing the needs of timber producers and 
conservationists it said the six states with the best forest 
management programs were washington california idaho oregon 
massachusetts and minnesota

eastern airlines machinists union says it will 
disrupt air sea and ground transportation nationwide if it goes on 
strike against the airline saturday and aflcio officials pledged 
the support of their 14 million members 
as part of a strike machinists union officials said they also 
would picket outside easterns sister carrier continental airlines 
plus other airlines ships and transportation services covered by 
the federal railway labor act 
were talking about a total disruption of transportation in 
this country said frank ortis machinists local 702 vice 
president 
machinists leaders have been authorized by their 8500 members to 
call a strike after midnight friday which marks the end of a 30day 
coolingoff period set by federal mediators 
ortis and aflcio strike organizer gary horton helped lead a 
rally and news conference tuesday in which dozens of local unions 
were represented 
we will urge our 14 million members not to cross any picket 
lines horton said it means that those members would probably 
not fly on eastern or continental secondarily they would be out to 
rallies they would be out to strike sites they would be out to 
financally support the machinists 
eastern officials have expressed doubt the machinists can legally 
or practically spur a nationwide action 
eastern which says it is losing more than 1 million a day 
wants 150 million in wage concessions from the machinists who 
represent mechanics baggage handlers and other ground services 
workers 
the national mediation board which entered the 17monthold 
contract dispute in january 1988 has asked president bush to 
appoint an emergency panel that could delay a strike 60 days 
eastern says it cant afford the delay but the aflcio and 
machinists support the emergency panel 
separately the machinists filed court papers denying the 
companys complaint to us district judge c clyde atkins that the 
union was violating atkins injunction against a work slowdown 
atkins scheduled a hearing for today 
meanwhile the eastern pilots union said tuesday it was 
continuing talks with management on a new contract covering job 
security and other issues 
air line pilots association leaders have urged their 3500 
eastern members to honor machinists picket lines however pilots 
union members indicated last week they might cross picket lines if 
eastern granted contract concessions 
pilots generally are considered the most crucial and 
hardesttoreplace airline employees in a strike 
eastern has declined to comment on negotiations this week

britains merchandise trade deficit widened to 209 
billion pounds or 363 billion in january from a revised deficit 
of 176 billion pounds in december the government said wednesday 
januarys trade gap compared with a deficit of 145 billion 
pounds in january 1988 the department of trade and industry said 
the financial markets had been expecting a deficit of about 185 
million pounds and the treasury moved quickly to say they 
shouldnt put too much emphasis on the figures 
monthly trade figures can be very erratic and among the 
last indicators to respond to a tightening of monetary policy 
said a treasury spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with 
british custom 
the pound fell slightly on the news from 17350 to 17300 
bryan gould trade spokesman for the opposition labor party said 
the figures show britain is now an economy which cannot pay its 
way and which is falling further and further behind in the 
competitive race 
the figures showed exports totaled a record 737 billion pounds 
in january up from 69 billion pounds in december and up from 64 
billion pounds in january 1988 
imports totalled a record 947 billion pounds in january up from 
866 billion pounds in december and up from 78 billion pounds in 
january 1988 
the december merchandise trade deficit was previously reported as 
166 billion pounds the government said the upward revision in the 
december figures was due mainly to a revision in the seasonal 
adjustments for 1988 
with januarys trade in invisible items which covers services 
overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments 
estimated to be in surplus by 400 million pounds britains current 
account showed a deficit of 169 billion pounds compared with a 
revised deficit of 136 billion pounds in december

sharp widening in britains merchandise trade deficit 
share prices fell back momentarily after the release of the

the trade deficit widened to 209 billion pounds or 363 
billion from a revised deficit of 176 billion pounds in december 
the government said 
by 1230 pm the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
was 244 points or 12 percent higher at 20268 points little 
changed from 20250 just before the trade figures were released

and then fell to its low point of 20143 minutes after the results 
of the data were known 
share turnover reached a moderately healthy 3416 million shares

a new plan to require 800 million in work on 
aging airliners will provide an extra margin of safety even though 
the planes already are perfectly safe an airline trade 
association official said today 
officials of united delta and american airlines who worked on an 
agingaircraft task force joined tuesday in endorsing the groups 
farreaching recommendations to increase the safety of older boeing 
airliners 
transportation secretary samuel skinner says steps are being 
taken to write the proposal into law 
collectively we decided that it was far better to be 
preemptive in our maintenance activity rather than to wait for 
problems to develop clyde kizer vice president of the air 
transport association an airline trade group said today on abcs 
good morning america 
the task force which also included other us and foreign 
industry and government safety experts called for 600000 in 
modifications and replacements on each of more than 1300 older 
boeing 747s 737s and 727s 
the aircraft that are out there right now are perfectly safe 
and the activities that the airlines are taking in regards to the 
maintenance were satisfactory kizer said this supplies an 
extra protection margin 
bob doll united airlines vice president for technical services 
said the proposals conform with steps the airline is already taking 
to keep its older airliners in shape 
we dont anticipate anything over and above what weve already 
planned to do said doll 
kizer said the proposals had nothing to do with damage to 
uniteds oldest 747 on a flight from honolulu to auckland new 
zealand last friday 
investigators into the incident in which nine passengers were 
hurled to their deaths over the pacific ocean say they have found no 
signs of metal fatigue or corrosion associated with aging instead 
they have focused on possible mechanical problems with the cargo 
door that ripped off along with a portion of the airliners skin 
julian may delta vice president said none of his airlines 
fleet of 130 model 727s would be affected by the proposals right 
away 
it will be several years before we are affected because of 
fleet age he said 
pan ams top executive thomas g plaskett also endorsed the 
proposal saying that unless older airliners are restored and kept 
operating there may not be enough planes to serve the growing 
worldwide travel demand 
no airliners would be scrapped under the proposal which asks the 
federal aviation administration to order the work that would include 
replacement of parts subject to wear rather than repeated 
inspections and repairs only when they wear out 
an official of boeing commercial aircraft co which manufactured 
the affected airliners said the older jetliners covered by the plan 
are safe and should last indefinitely if the recommended work is 
done 
we believe that the aircraft out there flying are safe said 
ben cosgrove boeing engineering vice president who sits on the task 
force but he said the work was needed to reduce the number of 
regular inspections needed for older aircraft 
the recommendations are based on 150 service bulletins issued by 
boeing which is now to write them into a single massive bulletin 
for presentation to the faa 
skinner praised the task forces work as the first product of a 
cooperative international government and industry effort to deal 
with the problem of the worlds aging airliner fleet 
the average age of the 8800 airliners in use around the world is 
just over 13 years and aviation experts predict that will increase 
each year for several years as new airliner construction is 
backlogged and few old aircraft are junked 
skinner said the faa has already begun the internal rulemaking 
procedures needed to make the recommended work mandatory for all 
us airlines 
in all more than 1300 airliners worldwide would be affected by 
the plan about onethird of them operated by us carriers the 
recommendations would also be given to foreign airlines and 
regulatory bodies some of whom participated on the task force 
the proposed repairs and replacements would be tied to the number 
of times an airliner had taken off and landed and its time in the 
sky 
service records of older mcdonnell douglas dc10s dc9s and 
dc8s and aircraft build overseas are also being studied by task 
force committees they are due to make recommendations later this 
year

beer flowed freely in iceland for the 
first time in 74 years today as the last vestiges of prohibition 
came to an end 
lines formed outside some of the nations 17 state liquor stores 
waiting patrons applauded when the snorra braut liquor store in 
central reykjavik opened for business at 9 am 
icelanders voted for prohibition in a 1908 referendum the law 
didnt take effect until 1915 when it was assumed the last 
alcoholic beverage on the island had been drunk 
the ban was repealed in 1933 but through a legal quirk beer with 
alcoholic content above 225 percent remained under prohibition a 
powerful temperance lobby kept it that way until may when parliament 
voted 138 to lift the ban effective march 1 
this is a truly historic moment in my life and the life of this 
nation said pall sverrisson a cab driver this is what we have 
been fighting for and this is what we have been dreaming of for so 
long 
many restaurants and bars reported their tables had been booked 
weeks in advance by customers planning to celebrate 
the luxury doesnt come cheap 
with the government levying a hefty tax liquor stores are 
charging up to 5760 for a 24can case of imported beer a glass of 
beer in a bar costs 390 to 480 
education minister svavar gestsson who campaigned against 
lifting the ban accused the media of hyping the occasion and said 
efforts to educate people on the dangers of drink have proved in 
vain against this terrible flood 
reykjavik police chief boedvar bragason said his force was on 
heightened alert for drunken drivers

drexel burnham lambert inc voluntarily agreed to 
terminate michael milken and withhold his 1988 pay of more than 100 
million despite claims by the prominent bond trader that drexel was 
coerced into the provisions the government said 
in court papers filed tuesday federal prosecutors rejected a 
motion by milken to have drexels firms landmark securities fraud 
settlement with the justice department thrown out or modified 
because it violates milkens rights 
the coercion issue is at the heart of the first legal challenge 
to the settlement milken claims that drexel was forced to resolve 
the case or face racketeering charges that included freezing the 
investment firms multibilliondollar assets 
milken alleged that the government forced drexel to have him 
dismissed and his 1988 compensation most of it in a bonus that 
would far surpass 100 million withheld 
acting us attorney benito romano called the charge of coercion 
nothing short of absurd 
to argue that drexel a highly sophisticated investment banking 
firm represented by numerous highly qualified attorneys was 
incapable of making a voluntary choice in this matter strains 
credulity romano wrote 
in an accompanying affidavit drexel chief executive officer 
frederick h joseph said the investment firm entered into the plea 
agreement with the justice department voluntarily and without 
coercion after consulting with counsel 
the statement while technically accurate since drexel endorsed 
the total pact appeared to be at odds with earlier statements by 
the company that it disputed portions of the agreement and fought to 
have provisions on milken withdrawn 
joseph also was quoted in earlier court papers as saying the 
milken provisions were unfair and horrendous and were 
inserted at the governments insistence 
drexel in december agreed to pay a record 650 million fine and 
plead guilty to six felonies to settle criminal securities fraud 
charges with the justice department 
milken and his brother lowell a senior drexel aide who also 
would lose at least half of his 1988 pay charged that drexel was 
coerced by the government into the requirements neither milken has 
been charged with any criminal wrongdoing 
us district judge kimba wood is to rule on the milkens motion 
in his response romano also said the milkens had failed to show 
that their employment pay and bonuses were constitutionally 
protected or supported by a written contract joseph said neither of 
the milkens had a contract with drexel 
milken who still heads drexels beverly hills califbased 
junk or highyield bond financing department is one of the 
biggest targets of a federal crackdown on securities law abuse he 
is expected to be indicted on fraud and racketeering charges in 
connection with the governments lengthy investigation of drexel 
in a separate development attorneys for milken sought to have 
proceedings halted while they ask the us supreme court to 
disqualify a judge presiding over drexels settlement of civil 
charges with the securities and exchange commission 
the milkens have asked that us district judge milton pollack 
who must approve the sec pact be disqualified because of an alleged 
conflict of interest 
the milkens attorneys on monday asked the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals to issue a temporary injunction so pollack does not make 
any rulings on the sec settlement until the supreme court decides 
whether to consider the disqualification motion 
the 12member court last week refused a request to consider the 
bid to have pollack disqualified on grounds that his wife could 
receive 30 million from a leveraged buyout drexel recently helped 
finance a threemember court panel already had rejected the motion 
if a stay were granted it would hold up the sec settlement 
which is in final negotiation stages that in turn would delay 
completion of the criminal plea agreement which is contingent on 
settlement of the civil charges

the chairman of the federal communications 
commission today rejected a senators request to delay a 
controversial overhaul of atampts rate structure despite widespread 
congressional criticism of the proposed action 
fcc chairman dennis patrick told sen james exon dneb he will 
press ahead at a march 16 commission meeting with the plan to change 
the way american telephone amp telegraph charges customers he said 
the part of the proposal covering interstate service could go into 
effect july 1 
exon asked patrick at the hearing of the senate commerce science 
and transportation subcommittee on communications if he would 
postpone consideration of the rate cap plan until two vacancies 
on the fivemember fcc are filled by the bush administration 
the commission has been two members short since the beginning of 
last year and president bush has yet to announce choices for the 
open slots 
it is extraordinarily important to restructure the incentives 
that we give this industry patrick told exon today we have to 
begin to send a message the sooner we start on that the better 
patrick on tuesday told the house telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee the plan could save residential customers 700 million 
in the next four years while giving atampt the incentive to streamline 
and modernize 
but subcommittee chairman ed markey dmass asked patrick why 
all the people who are purported to benefit from this plan still 
oppose it and why all those who are supposed to be regulated by it 
are clamoring for its immediate implementation 
the fcc proposal would change the two decadesold rate of 
return regulation that allows atampt certain specified profits 
beyond its costs 
the new plan what patrick called incentive regulation 
would place a cap on what atampt could charge customers but would 
allow the company to keep any funds after costs as profit 
congress let the plan die last year because of concerns that 
windfall profits could result at the expense of consumers but 
patrick is moving ahead with it after making changes he says meet 
congressional concerns 
weve made several changes to satisfy their concerns and well 
continue to discuss them said patrick but the commission will 
consider the pricing matter on the 16th 
patricks july 1 target leaves congressional critics little time 
to pass an alternative that precludes the fcc 
at this point we dont have a concensus said markey 
rep bill richardson dnm said congress has left a vacuum 
that patrick is filling with his action he urged his colleagues to 
preserve our role in the regulatory process 
and rep rick boucher dva told reporters that patrick should 
postpone an fcc vote for a second time in new of the bipartisan 
nature of the concerns expressed at tuesdays hearing 
boucher was one of several lawmakers from rural areas who said 
patrick hasnt provided real safeguards to prevent atampt raising 
rates unfairly for sparsely populated regions while giving discounts 
to businesses and residents of cities 
talk may still be cheap in urban areas but its about to get 
very expensive in rural areas an absent rep jim cooper dtenn 
said in a statement read at the hearing 
boucher told reporters patrick is making movement in the right 
direction but i think its not enough 
id say we would have price caps in due course he said 
but under this plan atampt could be an enormous profit machine 
patrick outlined provisions that would limit atampts ability to 
raise or lower rates for various customers and said he would look at 
other safeguards to ensure price changes for less populated regions 
remain within the zone of reasonableness 
he said atampt would have to cut overall prices by 3 percent over 
four years under the fcc plan 
patrick also sought to mollify congress by proposing to divide 
atampts services into three baskets one group including 
residential and small business customers for example and allowing 
only limited price increases or decreases for each service

xerox corp introduced three new copiers 
today including two lowvolume models and a copier with a beveled 
edge that can make copies from books without ruining bindings 
the machines were displayed at a news conference at the companys 
major manufacturing center in the rochester suburb of webster xerox 
is based in stamford conn 
the lowvolume copiers the 5012 and the 5014 make 12 copies a 
minute and come with xeroxs unique threeyear warranty on parts and 
labor and a copy cartridge guarantee 
xerox has always enjoyed a strong position in the mid and 
highvolume copier segments but has not fared as well in the highly 
competitive lowvolume and personal copier markets 
these new machines represent the companys attempt to increase 
its presence in the lowvolume market which includes machines that 
make up to 30 copies a minute said paul cahn vice president of 
reprographics product support for xeroxs us marketing group 
were aiming to set the industry benchmark for quality and 
value in the lowvolume range cahn said 
the 5012 costs 2325 the 5014 which has reduction and 
enlargement capabilities costs 2850 
the companys other new copier the 5042 was designed for book 
copying mostly with the library industry in mind cahn said 
it has a 35degree slanted copying surface and a hinged cover 
that will follow the shape of a book or other bound material instead 
of squashing it down it makes 35 copies a minute 
xerox officials said their studies found that in 1985 libraries 
spent about 40 million to repair broken book bindings and they 
believe the 5042 machine will help save bindings 
the machine also features a versatile vending attachment that 
will accept coins bills and special vending cards 
we have offered vending before but it was just coins said 
jim miller xeroxs manager of decentralized product marketing 
and librarians told us they were tired of spending their whole day 
making change for people 
the 5042 costs 9470 
all of the machines are available to buy or rent immediately

from knightridder inc which has put all eight of its network 
affiliate tv stations up for sale 
the agreement between the two companies was reached late monday 
terms of the sale were not revealed 
the miamibased knightridder whose main business is newspaper 
publishing said last month it had reached agreements to sell five 
stations and was negotiating on the sale of three others including 
ktvy in oklahoma city 
its remaining two stations are wtentv in albany ny and

knightridder which put all eight stations up for sale last 
fall said it expected to get a total of 400 million for them

station koco which gannett already owned when it purchased the 
evening news association stations

the government issued two reports today suggesting economic 
growth is weakening contrary to a fourthquarter 1988 assessment 
issued tuesday that signaled rising inflation and an unabated us 
appetite for foreign goods 
the commerce department said americans personal income shot up 
18 percent in january the biggest increase in more than a year 
but that the pace of consumer spending was nearly unchanged after a 
strong gain in december 
a slowdown in consumer spending would be welcome news to some 
because of worries that demand has been outstripping the production 
capabilities of factories already coping with high operating rates 
and tight labor markets 
in another report the commerce department said construction 
spending rose 04 percent in january the weakest performance since 
october rising interest rates have dampened activity in most areas 
of the construction business with fixedrate mortgages averaging 
nearly 11 percent 
the reports came a day after the department released figures on 
fourthquarter growth that worried economists because it suggested 
pickup in inflation partly because of the summer drought 
while the overall growth figure of 2 percent was unchanged from 
an initial report a month ago the report also showed that the 
countrys trade imbalance worsened even more than previously 
estimated imports grew at an annual rate of 13 percent swamping a 
7 percent gain in exports 
consumer spending rose at a robust 35 percent annual rate too 
fast given constraints on production resulting from tight labor 
markets and high factory operating rates economists said the jump 
in consumer spending which went primarily to bigticket items such 
as cars also showed americans are still spending and borrowing to 
buy foreign goods 
in other economic news tuesday a real estate trade group 
reported sales of existing homes fell 74 percent in january the 
biggest decline in two years but housing industry experts said the 
drop reflected a return to more normal buying patterns following a 
december sales spurt 
the national association of realtors said that existing 
singlefamily homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 363 million units in january after 57 percent rise in december 
to a rate of 392 million 
none of the reports had much impact on the financial markets on 
wall street stock prices rose slightly in what analysts called a 
reflex response to its sharp declines of the previous week bond 
prices a sensitive barometer of the economy fell sightly and the 
dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies

telemedia inc canadas largest publisher of 
consumer magazines said wednesday it has reached a tentative 
agreement to buy new england monthly a 5yearold regional magazine 
that has been struggling toward profitability 
terms of the sale were not disclosed pending ratification of the 
agreement by the magazines 59 shareholders robert nylen the 
publisher said the legal papers will be completed this week and the 
shareholders probably will vote before the end of march 
telemedia said both nylen 44 and the magazines editor daniel 
okrent 40 will continue in their jobs 
despite winning national awards for journalism and tripling its 
circulation to more than 116000 new england monthlys costs 
continue to exceed its revenues nylen said 
we started in 1984 and weve made progress in each subsequent 
year each year weve shaved our losses by several hundred thousand 
dollars and now were within striking distance of profitability 
nylen said 
the magazine based in haydenville mass has a staff of 40 and 
annual revenues of more than 4 million it won national magazine 
awards for general excellence in 1985 and 1986 
a literate breezy often irreverent publication new england 
monthly frequently profiles small companies or craftsmen and devotes 
one issue a year to local heroes but it has been harshly 
critical of some of new englands most powerful institutions and 
individuals recent issues for example have cast rhode islands 
leading families and massachusetts lotus development corp in an 
unflattering light 
approximately 6 million has been invested in the magazine since 
1984 and nylen said telemedia will inject a few million dollars 
more to keep it going 
i expect that the magazine will operate much as it has but it 
is not immutable nylen said what we really want is their 
advice and counsel and that may mean changes in marketing 
advertising or other areas 
stephen j weir telemedias vice president for finance said 
stockholders of the magazine will not receive any payment up front 
but will be paid over a period of years under a formula tied to new 
england monthlys future earnings he declined to comment on the 
potential size of the payments 
the shareholders include private investors venture capitalists 
and two british merchant banks 
telemedia incs other holdings include canadian television and 
radio stations the canadian edition of tv guide and harrowsmith 
magazine

stock investors virtually overlooked news of a 
widerthanexpected british trade deficit wednesday and bid shares 
higher on newly found hopes that the government might be able to 
avoid raising interest rates 
equities were marked broadly lower immediately after the trade 
figures were announced before midday but there wasnt any selling 
pressure to justify the markdown and prices soon recovered to their 
best levels of the day 
britains merchandise trade deficit widened sharply to 209 
billion pounds or 363 billion in january from a revised deficit 
of 176 billion pounds in december the department of trade and 
industry said 
there was relief that we didnt get a trade figure that implied 
an immediate interestrate rise an analyst said it is still 
felt the authorities will avoid a rate rise if they can hope to do 
so 
at the close the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
was up 189 points or 09 percent at 20213 
volume was moderate with 5354 million shares changing hands 
but most of this business came on a spurt of buying interest in the 
morning dealers said on tuesday turnover was a meager 3578 
million shares

sears 824 stores across the nation began reopening today after a 
42hour facelift to complete price reductions on 15 billion pieces 
of merchandise 
people are backed up as far as we can see its walltowall 
people said bob dumas manager of the sears roebuck and co 
northland mall store in columbus ohio 
we have christmasquantity people and we have better than 
christmas traffic said dumas who estimated that more than 1000 
people waited outside for the doors to open 
workers changed prices tuesday on everything including light 
bulbs toasters and polished door knobs as sears roebuck and co 
prepared for a new retailing strategy it hopes will win customers 
employees also had to change signs and displays take inventory 
and clean up before the openings which occurred at noon local time 
the worst was the screwdrivers said chris skinner a high 
school freshman who spent much of the day at the northland mall 
store in columbus ohio repricing baby booties and toddlers 
dresses you had to take them all down clean each one by hand 
then put them all back 
sears intends to keep its prices low yearround instead of 
marking them up and down periodically for sales this marks a major 
change for the retailer which helped to pioneer the concept of the 
sale 
last year sears sold 55 percent of its goods at sale prices 
the company said it still will run some sales but for reasons 
like simply clearing out lawn mowers in the fall otherwise it will 
use the strategy that retailers call everyday low pricing 
sears in adopting the strategy joins a growing list that 
includes k mart corp dayton hudson corps target discount chain 
and montgomery ward and co 
at the columbus store 700 workers scrambled to the tune of 
dont worry be happy as they marked down items such as twin 
canopy beds from 26999 to 9900 a diehard automobile battery 
from 72 to 64 and a craftsman power drill from 5999 to 3262 
sears new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its own 
brands and the 1000 other brand names it carries 
i dont think they had any choice they lost their customer 
base said karen sacks an analyst with standard and poors corp 
in new york i think wednesday will be a madhouse at sears but 
will they be able to reeducate their customers not to come in just 
for a sale 
monroe greenstein an analyst with the investment firm bear 
stearns in new york said the strategy paid off in wichita kan 
where sales rose 15 percent when sears tested the idea last fall 
and sears will invest in an advertising campaign that to not 
hear about it you would practically have to be comatose 
greenstein said 
the cash register rings about 3000 times a day in the 
100000squarefoot columbus store but the only sound in the last 
couple of days was the clicking of pricing guns and muffled sounds 
of store officials keeping in touch with walkietalkies 
about 100 high school students worked for 5 an hour to help 
company officials in shirtsleeves and scores of others with the 
makeover 
its the most exciting thing ive ever been involved in in 
sears said bob dumas manager of the northland mall store and a 
30year sears employee 
its no longer that old sea of yellow he said referring to 
sears old yellowwithblacklettering sale signs 
the new signs touting new lower prices are in vibrant red and 
blue in apparel the signs are magenta and gray 
they really needed to do something dramatic like that ms 
sacks said well just have to wait a year or two to see if it 
works

one man ordered a custombuilt granite 
mausoleum with two crypts included for the familys german shepherd 
dogs 
another family asked for a specially designed walkin 
aboveground burial building with space for a sons favorite car 
a third family had a mausoleum designed to include a favorite 
chair from their sitting room for relatives to use when they come to 
meditate the past 
theyre part of a growing market for preassembled or custombuilt 
solid mausoleums that inspired cold spring granite co a leading 
granite supplier with revenues of about 150 million in 1988 to 
establish a private estates division to focus on what had been a 
small part of company business 
theres a trend of people wanting to be buried above ground and 
its increasing every year said wally pattock vice president of 
memorialization its not something we developed its demand by 
the people 
of the approximately 23 million people who die in the united 
states each year nearly 10 percent have arranged for mausoleum 
entombment according to cold spring granite which has corporate 
offices in st cloud minn and two of its fabrication plants in the 
nearby cold spring area 
people have several reasons for choosing aboveground burial 
said teresa r bohnen whose title is market managermemorialization 
for private estates 
the people most interested in private estates are those who 
were nearly famous who had major accomplishments but perhaps didnt 
get the recognition they feel they should have bohnen said 
the mausoleums are intended for the person who is looking for a 
more exclusive form of immortality said james terhaar general 
manager of the private estates division 
the growth of the private mausoleum industry he said is a 
carryover from the increase in burials in large community mausoleums 
around the country 
mausoleums have been popular in the southern united states where 
the water table or sandy soil makes inground burial impossible in 
many areas the company officials said 
i always hear the words its clean its dry above ground 
terhaar said 
cold spring granite sold between 200 and 300 preassembled 
mausoleum units in 1988 the units contain from two to six crypts 
and range in estimated retail price from 12000 to 40000 bohnen 
said there is no upper limit on the cost of custom units which 
have been sold for as much as 15 million 
except for highly specialized custom work all sales of private 
estates mausoleums are through cemeteries or monument retailers 
the wealthy arent the only ones to buy mausoleums middle aged 
and elderly also are customers terhaar said 
it really runs the gamut of society in our local cemetery 
we have a guy who worked in the plant crating products he said 
it goes all the way up its not so much the ability to pay its 
more a desire for aboveground entombment 
certainly in number we sell more at the low end that is within 
the means of many many more people said terhaar who estimated 
that the private estates division represents 2 percent to 3 percent 
of cold spring granites total sales 
were trying to double that this year he said 
while there are several other companies in the country that make 
mausoleums cold spring granite offers special service in helping 
retailers sell the products and sending crews to cemeteries to erect 
the buildings said terry carlson president of st charles memorial 
works in st charles ill a retail business that has bought 
mausoleums from cold spring granite 
its not a very common sale said carlson who has sold nine 
mausoleums ranging in price from 12000 to 750000 in 25 years of 
business i would say the largest percentage of monument shops 
like i am never even sell one during their time in business 
customers who buy the larger walkin mausoleums normally are 
affluent families he said in a telephone interview 
it continues their lifestyle their honored place in society 
in death as well as in life i really feel its a prestigious type 
of purchase said carlson 
but sometimes he said retailers have to let customers know the 
mausoleums are an option 
i think the dealer has to show the product its like buying 
any other item if you dont know about the cadillac and they only 
show you fords youre gonna buy a ford he said

it can be refreshing and revealing and even 
educational to take a contrary view of old and accepted truths 
such as the notion that the customer is always right 
repeated again and again some popular assumptions are accepted 
without criticism acted on without examination and repeated as the 
gospel truth beware in economics old truths often are revealed as 
old errors 
there still exist for example many trusting purchasers who 
believe the adage that the customer is always right and there are 
dutiful companies that faithfully adhere to that philosophy and even 
advertise it 
but that doesnt mean they really believe it 
while not acknowledging it publicly some producers of products 
and services blame customers for not having the common sense to read 
directions or the ability to follow the directions they have read 
research seems to document it two complaints out of three are 
caused by problems for which the customer is at least partly to 
blame according to a research report in the quality review a 
professional journal 
instances in which customer incompetence has caused problems 
span virtually every industry in every country it states the 
moral being that perfect quality control at the factory cannot 
satisfy imperfect customers 
it cites the example of an unnamed manufacturer who became so fed 
up with improper use of his product he ordered a sticker placed on 
each item it read when all else fails read the directions 
another accepted truth is that the federal budget deficit is 
the worst ever that it is the cause of numerous other problems and 
that there is no way to correct these problems without balancing the 
budget 
john dessauer an investment adviser who adorns his journal of 
financial markets with the slogan authentic developments from 
an untrodden point of view feels we might be trodding over a clod 
in the sod 
forgotten by all is the fact that a dollar in 1988 was worth only 
48 cents compared with a dollar in 1976 he says his point is this 
a 1988 federal deficit of 1551 billion is the same as a deficit of 
74 billion in 1976 
since the actual deficit in 1976 was 737 billion he says 
the truth is that the federal deficit today is about the same as 
it was when president carter took office 
thats by one measurement by another he says it might be even 
less of a problem in 1976 he points out the federal deficit was 
43 percent of gross national product in 1988 it was 31 percent 
two other economic assumptions have gained tremendous 
respectability of late especially since they have been cited as 
inflation signals by alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve 
board 
with industrial capacity at close to 85 percent and with the 
jobless rate falling well below 55 percent the assuumption is that 
inflation is about to become red hot economists often 
argumentative are almost unanimous about this 
edward yardeni economics director at prudentialbache securities 
inc disagrees strongly this is how he views the low jobless rate 
and its potential consequences 
we believe that the employers recognize that offering big wage 
hikes will only drive up their labor costs rather than attract 
workers that demographically speaking dont exist 
instead he contends industries will opt to spend more on 
laborsaving productivityenhancing capital to substitute for 
scarce and expensive workers 
what about the capacity limitations of industry we believe 
that tight capacity stimulates capacity expansion rather than big 
price increases he says 
he contends that the federal reserves tough antiinflation 
policy is also antigrowth and that he argues could dampen the 
capacity expansion which is the best way of eliminating inflationary 
bottlenecks

soybean futures prices closed sharply lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade amid forecasts for rain in 
argentinas soybean fields and signs that supplies may not be as 
tight as previously feared 
wheat futures advanced modestly due to an increase in export 
business while corn futures finished mixed 
soybean futures plunged in the sessions final 10 minutes 
following forecasts for rain in argentina later today and over the 
weekend 
the selling also reflected an increase wednesday in the number of 
notices of intent to deliver soybeans against the march contract 
a greater number of notices indicates a greater willingness among 
commercial traders to sell physical soybeans which suggests an 
easing of supply fears 
soybean delivery notices posted wednesday morning totaled 92 
million bushels compared with 44 million bushels on tuesday the 
first notice day for the march contract 
wheat gained strength from the agriculture departments decision 
to target iraq for sales of 1 million metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices and from reports that the soviet union was 
bidding for 500000 metric tons of subsidized us wheat 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 439 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to cent higher with march at 271 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 2 cents lower with march at 203 a bushel soybeans were 
3 cents to 12 cents lower with march at 750 a bushel

shoppers swarmed to sears roebuck and co which reopened its 
824 stores wednesday after cutting prices on 50000 items to 
introduce its new everyday low pricing policy and mark the end 
of an era in retailing 
the nations biggest retailer switched to more namebrand 
merchandise and discount prices in hopes of luring shoppers away 
from cutrate competitors like k mart and walmart which have grown 
rapidly at the expense of sears and other oldline general retailers 
i think it might cheapen them a little bit but theyre a grade 
higher than k mart said pam cage 31 one of about 3000 shoppers 
who crowded a sears store at miamis international mall on wednesday 
the 103yearold company added some suspense to the changeover by 
closing all its stores for 42 hours from 6 pm local time monday 
until noon wednesday store managers and employees around the 
country worked late into the night tuesday retagging an estimated 
15 billion pieces of merchandise and erecting colorful signs 
touting the new prices 
in atlanta about 200 people gathered outside of sears southlake 
mall store to get the first crack at the lower prices though not 
all of them were convinced the change was for the better 
my mother said if they cut all those prices it would be like k 
mart i say the day they do that is the day i stop buying here 
said marcy mccullough of mcdonough ga 
but in the past she said sears has been charging too much for 
stuff thats not really worth it 
prices under the new policy may vary among the retailers 24 
regions but sears officials are convinced the strategy will win 
approval 
when customers come in and see were not fooling around when we 
say were reducing prices theyll be very impressed predicted 
ken smith manager of a sears store on chicagos northwest side 
shoppers found markdowns wednesday that approached 25 percent on 
some items including a housebrand kenmore 18cubicfoot 
refrigerator slashed to 550 from 730 in smiths store 
he said the new price would be sears everyday price on the 
refrigerator 
sears switch to everyday low pricing a strategy pioneered by 
discount chains and adapted successfully last year by chicagobased 
montgomery ward amp co makes sears comparable to the discounters in 
price but not in looks 
although shoppers found some merchandise displayed in 
warehouselike stacks most of the goods were shown in the more 
decorative fashion familiar to sears shoppers 
the strategy marks a departure from the traditional retailing 
technique which sears practically invented of hyping goods through 
periodic sales sears said it will continue to have sales but they 
will be fewer and thinner than in the past 
gilbert wels 44 of sewaren nj said he was worried that the 
drop in prices could mean a decline in quality as well 
i will still buy at sears but i will check out the quality 
he said 
but not all customers were pleased 
lynn carver of barkhamsted conn said she drove to a west 
hartford sears store to exchange some bedsheets and found the price 
was about 20 percent higher than the week before 
operating manager larry glowa said the sheets had been on sale 
last week and were not among the items reduced in price on wednesday 
the new policy is a major component of a restructuring plan that 
also includes the proposed sale of the companys towering 
headquarters building in chicago and a realignment of sears 
financial network allstate insurance dean witter reynolds 
brokerage services and coldwell banker real estate to focus on 
consumer business 
sears stores will continue to change in coming months as more 
namebrand goods are introduced a major addition will be the 
opening of brand central electronics superstores inside 400 sears 
outlets

xerox corp hopes a copier introduced 
wednesday will save the encyclopedias dictionaries and other books 
in libraries around the country from brokenbinding syndrome 
the xerox 5042 has a slanted edge and a hinged cover that allow a 
book or other bound material to be laid flat without squashing or 
stretching the binding 
weve responded very directly to a market need said paul 
cahn vice president of reprographics product support for xeroxs 
us marketing group 
xerox officials said their studies found that libraries spent 
about 40 million in 1985 to repair broken book bindings 
this is very much of a niche kind of product but its the kind 
of thing that will give xerox a presence in places it wants to be 
like universities and libraries where a lot of people will see 
their name said bob sostilio a copierindustry analyst with 
dataquest inc of san jose calif 
the 5042 makes 35 copies a minute and can make reductions and 
enlargements it sells for 9470 
the machine also features a vending attachment that accepts 
coins bills and magnetic cards 
we have offered vending before but it was just coins said 
jim miller xeroxs manager of decentralized product marketing 
and librarians told us they were tired of spending their whole day 
making change for people 
the american library association asked copier companies to come 
up with a copier that wouldnt damage books and would make better 
copies of bound materials 
xerox is one of two companies to offer a machine built with 
libraries in mind 
the other manufacturer oce business systems of venlo 
netherlands introduced two library copiers in january said company 
spokesman john james 
also on wednesday xerox introduced two new lowvolume copiers 
that are designed to keep the company ahead in that highly 
competitive segment of the market which includes copiers that make 
up to 30 copies a minute 
all three machines were displayed at a news conference at the 
companys major manufacturing center in the rochester suburb of 
webster xerox is based in stamford conn

wouldbe travelers to and from south florida and the 
caribbean were steering away from eastern airlines as the carriers 
saturday strike deadline neared travel agents said wednesday 
agents said most customers were asking to change reservations or 
turn in eastern tickets easterns largest union the machinists is 
poised for a strike if no contract settlement is reached by friday 
midnight 
there has been a surge in ticket sales at easterns competitors 
said several agents interviewed wednesday agents said participants 
in easterns onepass frequent flier program were for the most part 
sticking with eastern but the agents were reluctant to book other 
customers on the carrier 
eastern says anybody with a ticket for an eastern flight that is 
cancelled will get a refund or a seat on another airline 
besides confusing travelers in easterns major markets south 
florida the caribbean the east coast and latin america the 
looming strike has also raised the specter of disruption of south 
floridas lucrative ocean cruise business 
at miamis happy holidays travel which does about 30 percent of 
its business in eastern tickets most of them customers phone up 
and say right away please try and get me another airline said 
manager beatrix mompoint 
a lot of people are calling up asking not to be put on 
eastern said a travel agent at miamis barry white travel agent 
inc who identified herself only as agnes 
in washington michael dipietro of esplanade travel reported that 
his company remained hesitant about booking with eastern until 
we learn more about what is going to happen 
he said his agency is only booking eastern if clients 
specifically request the troubled airline 
even travel agents actively booking seats on eastern said they 
only do so with a warning to customers 
agent galen wightman of capitol hill travel associates said his 
washingtonbased company was advising customers of the possibility 
of a strike and warning that alternative arrangements might have to 
be made at the last minute 
mompoint said agents at happy holidays inform customers that 
eastrern tickets usually get accepted by other airlines in the 
event of a strike 
at eastern airline spokeswoman cori zywotow pledged disruption 
caused by a strike would be kept to a minimum 
eastern will refund tickets on cancelled flights she said 
if you want your money back youll receive a full refund 
according to zywotow agreements between eastern and other major 
airlines stipulate that tickets which are endorsed by eastern for 
travel on another airline will be honored by other carriers at no 
additional cost 
that accord she said also covers discountfare tickets 
purchased from eastern 
the effectiveness of the interline agreement however was being 
called into question by several other airlines including pan 
american world airways usair american airlines and trans world 
airlines all of which have reportedly withheld unconditional 
acceptance of eastern tickets pending their own reviews of the 
situation 
some airline analysts have said eastern might seek protection 
from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
which would make it difficult for other carriers to be compensated 
south floridas cruise lines which carry each year nearly 4 
million passengers most of them flown in from around the country 
and abroad could also be adversely affected by a strike at eastern

texas eastern corps oil and gas production and 
exploration units will be sold for about 14 billion to a british 
concern to help finance a friendly takeover by panhandle eastern 
corp panhandle announced wednesday 
the agreement with enterprise oil plc was reached just days after 
the two houston natural gas companies signed a 32 billion merger 
agreement 
they were able to reach this deal so quickly because the sale 
to enterprise had been under consideration by texas eastern before 
panhandle eastern made its offer to acquire the company panhandle 
eastern spokesman jim hart said 
the sale to enterprise oil includes texas easterns holdings in 
the united kingdom and norwegian sectors of the north sea denmark 
indonesia the netherlands and alaska panhandle eastern said 
the holdings include 13 producing oil and gas fields six fields 
that are under development and 14 undeveloped fields 
enterprise oil is an independent oil and gas exploration and 
production company according to a notice of the proposed 
acquisition if the purchase is approved enterpise said it would 
become the leading independent oil exploration and production 
company in the north sea in terms of reserves production and 
acreage 
panhandle easterns feb 20 merger agreement included a provision 
to sell nonpipeline assets to help finance the acquisition 
panhandle eastern officials said the sale announced wednesday was a 
big step toward that goal 
robert d hunsucker chairman president and chief executive 
officer at panhandle eastern said his company approved the sale 
under terms of the merger agreement 
hunsucker said panhandle eastern expected the sale to net more 
than 12 billion after taxes with proceeds to be used to help pay 
off most of 17 billion in shortterm loans taken for the texas 
eastern buyout 
the 14 billion sale price meets our expectations and is 
completely in line with what our financial analysis revealed 
hunsucker said in a statement 
the sale is expected to be complete in 60 to 90 days officials 
said and is subject to approval by enterprise oil shareholders and 
the british government 
texas eastern and panhandle eastern officials said last week that 
texas easterns 44 percent share in petrolane partners also could be 
sold within 60 days after the merger is complete 
the master limited partnership formed through the companys 
petrolane inc subsidiary in 1987 serves the international liquid 
petroleum gas market 
panhandle eastern is financing 80 percent or 26 billion of 
its 32 billion takeover along with 105 billion in refinancing 
and working capital hart said the 17 billion in interim 
financing is included in the figures 
panhandle easterns 53ashare cash tender offer came weeks 
after texas eastern rejected as inadequate houstonbased coastal 
corps 26 billion takeover bid 
coastal corp has extended its offer but has not said whether it 
intends to increase the 42ashare cash bid

a decision by alliance semiconductor 
corp to manufacture computer memory chips in this kansas city 
suburb could eventually create more than 1200 jobs gov john 
ashcroft said wednesday 
ashcroft announced at a news conference that the san jose 
califbased company will lease vacant space at the former atampt 
microelectronics plant in lees summit atampt continues to 
manufacture electronic components at the plant 
missouri officials said alliance is receiving 842 million in 
startup financing from public and private sources 
alliance said it hopes eventually to employ more than 1200 
workers in two clean rooms at the plant but said it will need 
financial backing to meet that goal clean rooms are immaculate work 
places designed designed to allow precise manufacturing of minute 
equipment 
the company expects to hire as many as 300 people in the next 
year to make chips in one of the 22000squarefoot clean rooms but 
expansion into the second room and additional employment will depend 
upon alliance getting another 40 million to 50 million in 
financing president nd reddy said after a press conference at the 
atampt plant 
reddy said the startup financing will get initial manufacturing 
started but more cash will be needed if alliance is to expand and 
thrive he said alliance hopes to raise the financing possibly 
through a public stock offering within a year 
alliance which was established in 1985 consists of 10 people 
working out of offices in san jose the company has licensed a 
japanese company nmb semiconductor to make the fast memory chips 
alliance has designed the lees summit plant would be alliances 
only wholly owned manufacturing site 
the plant will make static random access memory chips srams and 
eventually dynamic random access memory chips also called drams 
srams are faster but more expensive than the more common drams 
japan dominates the world market for computer memory chips 
alliance will invest 250000 in the startup while the 
remainder will come from other investors

copper futures prices soared wednesday amid supply concerns 
prompted by labor unrest in peru and underlined by the small number 
of copper delivery notices posted on new yorks commodity exchange 
on other exchanges preciousmetals futures prices plummeted 
soybean futures dropped sharply and grain energy and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed 
copper settled 39 cents to 88 cents higher on the commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in march at 1455 a pound 
the highest settlement price for the march contract since jan 27 
but still well below the record high for spot copper of 16475 a 
pound reached dec 8 on the exchange 
the rally was sparked by news that miners in peru the worlds 
sixthlargest copper producer would consider extending a planned 
3day strike if conditions warrant the strike is scheduled to begin 
on march 26 
the reports stirred memories of last falls 57day peruvian 
mining strike which was a major factor in coppers rise to record 
price levels 
demand for copper remains strong and supplies continue to be 
tight a situation reflected in the slim number of delivery notices 
posted tuesday and wednesday on the exchange 
the delivery notices signify the intent of commercial traders to 
deliver copper against the march contract which expires on march 
29 a small number of delivery notices would indicate a reluctance 
or inability among copper processors to deliver the metal 
suggesting that their own supplies are limited 
only three delivery notices were issued tuesday the first notice 
day and none were posted on wednesday 
analysts said the markets bullish supplyanddemand factors and 
strong chart signals could lead to another run at record price 
levels 
its starting to look like a replay of 1987 and 1988 when 
copper prices reached their last two peaks said fred demler metals 
economist with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
platinum led a steep selloff in preciousmetals futures as the 
strengthening dollar and rising interest rates spurred a further

a highly successful us government campaign to 
give american tobacco companies a share of the lucrative asian 
market is prompting congressional complaints that federal agencies 
are exporting death 
a bipartisan group of congressmen plans to introduce legislation 
thursday that would forbid the government from going to bat for the 
cigarette industry overseas 
the message we are sending is that asian lungs are more 
expendable than american lungs says rep mel levine dcalif 
says rep chet atkins dmass if we are as sensitive as we 
are about the health of american consumers this certainly looks 
like an outrageous double standard 
levine and atkins will be joined by rep bob whittaker rkan 
and rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on health and the environment in introducing 
the legislation 
tobacco exports mushroomed during the reagan administration as a 
result of a highly effective campaign against foreign trade barriers 
by the us special trade representatives office and other agencies 
us tobacco sales to asia increased by 76 per cent in 1987 
tobaccorelated earnings worldwide totaled about 25 billion 
atkins sees th overseas sale of american cigarettes as a health 
issue exporting death he calls it but his detractors in the 
tobacco industry and elsewhere regard it as a trade issue that takes 
on crucial importance because of the countrys huge albeit 
declining trade deficit the deficit for 1988 was 1373 billion 
under the draft legislation the president would be prevented 
from seeking the removal or reduction by any foreign country of 
any restrictions on the advertising manufacture packaging 
importation sale or distribution of tobacco products 
gary miller a spokesman for the tobacco institute which 
promotes the industrys interests says other countries are 
perfectly capable of determining and applying rules and 
regulations regarding tobacco products and they dont need the us 
congress stepping in to provide guidelines on how to handle that 
product in their own country 
the legislation also would require all exported tobacco to carry 
either a surgeon generals warning about the hazards of smoking or a 
comparable warning established by the importing country 
says mark eaton an aide to sen jesse helms rnc a stalwart 
backer of the tobacco industry we certainly think that as long as 
tobacco is a legal product we will fight to see that it can take 
advantage of the same agricultural export programs that other 
commodities receive 
the us government apparently operates with two minds about the 
propriety of promoting tobacco exports 
surgeon general c everett koop says i dont think that we as 
citizens can continue to tolerate exporting disease disability and 
death 
but peter allgeier assistant us trade representative for asia 
and the pacific has a different view 
allgeier did not return a reporters phone call but was quoted in 
the new york times as saying its not as though we are 
introducing asia to tobacco the chinese manufacture and consume 13 
trillion cigarettes annually 
the market in tiwan and korea was established long before any 
trade negotiations and theyre going to smoke whether the us is 
exporting cigarettes or not 
from all appearances allgeier has more clout than koop allgeier 
has been the point man for the campaign to help tobacco companies 
gain access to previously restricted markets in east asia 
allgeiers lever was section 301 of the us trade act of 1974 
which gives the government the authority to impose sanctions against 
any nation whose trade policies are unjustifiable unreasonable or 
discriminatory 
under threat of retaliatory us tariffs japan opened its doors 
to foreign cigarettes in october 1986 according to world watch 
magazine us cigarette exports to japan quadrupled 
under similar us pressure south korea and taiwan also dropped 
their restrictions on foreign cigarettes 
miller the tobacco institute spokesman said overall cigarette 
consumption has been declining in asia the world watch article 
written by lori heise says there has been a 5 per cent increase in 
cigarette consumption in taiwan since the restrictions were dropped 
a us government publication world situation and tobacco 
report says that after advertising for us cigarette commercials 
began saturating japanese television cigarette sales in japan 
increased 2 per cent reversing a 20year downward trend 
gregory connally who returned this week from a 10day trip to 
asia on behalf of the american cancer society says the us 
government should do less for the tobacco industry and more for food 
exporters 
were using valuable trading chits for a product that has no 
nutritional value he says 
while american beef wheat rice and citrus products are denied 
access to many asian countries he says marlboros and winstons 
are going to taiwan and south korea

rjr nabisco incs hightech smokeless 
cigarette may have been pulled from test markets but some analysts 
said wednesday the experimental smokes could start the same sort of 
product revolution that tab did for diet soft drinks 20 years ago 
i think down the road it will do real well said eric garner 
a vice president in the charlotte office of carolinas securities 
its a little rough but i think the concept is good and in the 
next 25 years were going to see more companies go to this 
rj reynolds tobacco announced tuesday it was withdrawing its 
premier brand after five months of test marketing in arizona and 
missouri smokers complained that the cigarette which used a carbon 
heat source to pull warm air over a flavor capsule and dried 
tobacco had a bad taste and smell 
everyone i know who tried it thought it was really horrible 
said pavlos m alexandrakis who follows tobacco companies for argus 
research corp in new york 
garner himself a smoker said he had tried one of the cigarettes 
when rjr made a presentation to investment groups the flavor he 
said was less than thrilling thats about all i can say 
it was a very strange thing if youre a smoker garner said 
there were no ashes but you kept flicking it out of habit it had 
a strange taste because you werent burning any tobacco just 
drawing air through it 
despite his own experience with premiers garner said he expects 
to see similar innovations in the future 
i remember the first tabs how terrible they were garner 
said they tasted just awful but now you have diet coke diet 
pepsi all these diet drinks it really was a revolutionary product 
more new products fail than succeed so premiers failure and 
im not sure its a total failure is not really surprising he 
said you try to find out whats wrong with a product in your test 
marketing and theyve obviously been given some things to work on 
im sure theyll take it back to the lab and keep tampering 
with it and monkeying around with it and theyll come up with 
something pretty good he said the consumer will tell them if 
theyve worked it out somewhere down the road 
this is no surprise said industry analyst emanuel goldman 
it was brought out stillborn 
goldman who works for painewebber inc said premier suffered 
from two fatal problems unacceptable taste and aroma 
what the company was saying was consumers will get used to it 
theyll give it an extra try he said thats inconsistent with 
the fact that we are a nation of channelhoppers and if you dont 
like it the first time youre not going to try it a second time 
tobacco growers initially were uneasy with premiers because they 
used significantly less tobacco than regular cigarettes but carlton 
blalock executive director of the tobacco growers association of 
north carolina said he doubts farmers will be jumping up and down 
with joy over premiers demise 
everybody said from the start it would have been better had it 
been a product that used more tobacco than a regular cigarette 
blalock said but i felt like on balance it might have worked out 
the cigarette had potential had it proven to be acceptable by 
the public because of some of the features that it offered 
especially on sidestream smoke and the fire safety issue he said 
had that been accepted as fully as it potentially might have 
been it could have more than offset the amount of tobacco used in 
the cigarette 
anytime somebody in the industry tries something new and it 
doesnt work out youre a little disappointed because it well could 
have a positive impact on tobacco growers down the road he said 
my guess is that they rjr will continue working on it it 
certainly would not make sense for them just to shelve it after all 
the investment thats been put into it

coastal corp of houston and arkla inc of 
shreveport la announced a major pipeline expansion wednesday that 
will open up markets in the northeast and the midwest to the 
prolific arkoma basin in eastern oklahoma 
officials said the the project will ultimately mean an extra 450 
million cubic feet per day of natural gas can be moved to the 
midwest and northeast 
they estimated that would increase the sales of oklahoma gas by 
300 million 
officials said most of the capacity expansion will come from a 
new 200mile pipeline originating in latimer county in eastern 
oklahoma and terminating in jefferson county ark 
they said the 30inch diameter pipeline will provide substantial 
additional capacity across oklahoma and arkansas to the southeast 
mainline of anr pipeline co a coastal subsidiary 
estimated cost of the new pipeline was set at 120 million 
officials said it could be in service by as early as mid1990 
the announcement was made at a news conference attended by 
oklahoma gov henry bellmon james f cordes executive vice 
president of coastal and mike bracy president of arklas pipeline 
group 
cordes said officials believe the new pipeline will allow 
oklahoma gas to be sold at a competitive price with natural gas from 
canada 
bracy said the first phase of the project will kick off next 
month 
from coastals prospective these agreements have three major 
benefits cordes said first we will substantially improve our 
ability to move gas out of oklahoma by providing greatly expanded 
transportation and pipeline links between our southwest and 
southeast pipeline facilities 
second by using our newly proposed connections in ohio to the 
major pipelines serving the northeast oklahoma producers will gain 
direct access to this major growing gas market 
third our anr pipeline subsidiary will gain access to the 
increasingly important gas supplies in the arkoma basis to meet the 
requirements of its customers in the future 
bracy said the project allows arkla to strengthen its access to 
new markets while at the same time increasing the efficiency of 
our existing pipeline system which will benefit our current 
customers and producers 
the extra sales of oklahoma gas will mean an additional 21 
million in gross production taxes for the state officials said 
those taxes go principally to the state teacher retirement program

to rule wednesday on a request by tyson foods inc to block holly 
farms inc from holding a shareholders vote on its proposed merger 
with conagra inc 
tyson foods the nations largest poultry producer has fought a 
fourmonth battle to acquire memphis tennbased holly farms a

producer 
tyson asked the court to stop holly farms from proceeding with a 
shareholders meeting to vote on the buyout 
delaware chancery court vice chancellor maurice hartnett iii said 
after a hearing that he would reserve his ruling on the request he 
did not say when the ruling could be expected 
holly farms which has twice spurned takeover offers from tyson 
has reached agreement to merge with omaha nebbased conagra but 
the deal has been blocked in court 
tyson based in springdale ark has offered 60 per share in 
cash in a buyout valued at more than 1 billion conagra has

million higher than the conagra offer said tyson attorney 
jonathon j lerner 
holly farms attorney kenneth nachbar argued that shareholders 
would be hurt if they were not allowed to vote on the merger

the chicago board of trade is moving to employ a 
computerized offhours trading system for competitive reasons but 
its proposed new system will provide a significantly improved 
audit trail for regulating its members the markets chairman said 
wednesday 
in a 20minute speech to the chicago division of the futures 
industry association karsten mahlmann said the board of trade 
within weeks would publicly unveil its proposed electronic 
auctionmarket system 
mahlmann said the new computerized trading method would be more 
than a system for matching orders and claimed it would surpass the 
globex trading system being developed by the rival chicago 
mercantile exchange 
the system to the greatest extent possible replicates the 
trading pit as we all know it today mahlmann said 
the board of trade informed its members 2 weeks ago that it was 
planning to implement the computerized system for trading during 
hours when the markets trading floor is closed 
its purpose then was described as primarily to give foreign 
investors easier access to the board of trades increasing market 
for us treasury bond futures members said 
industry observers have said the move into computerized trading 
by the board of trade appearently was prompted by a widespread 
federal investigation of suspected fraud at the board of trade and 
the merc 
but mahlmann indicated wednesday that market pressures were the 
primary motivation 
knowing that our competitors were developing a computerized 
trading system we privately proceeded to develop our own he said 
if i were president of the united statesand i knew that my 
neighbor competitor had a nuclear bomb i would have no alternative 
but to also develop such a weapon he said 
i may prefer other strategies to nuclear weapons and i may not 
necessarily use them but i simply cannot afford to have the weapon 
not in my arsenal he said 
but mahlmann also said a significantly improved audit trail 
would result from a new electronic orderentry system to allow 
greater regulation with minimal increased costs to members 
like globex the board of trades system is to use a computer to 
match orders to buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of 
financial instruments also like globex the system will be open to 
other futures exchanges that wish to list their products for trading 
but unlike globex which the merc is developing in partnership 
with londonbased reuters plc the board of trade system is to be 
developed and owned entirely by the exchange and its members 
mahlmann emphasized the differences wednesday saying it has 
become obvious to me at least and to the exchange that the 
technology used in globex is outdated and as that extremely 
costlyto market users

americans personal income in january posted 
its largest gain in more than a year rising 18 percent but people 
chose not to spend much of the extra money and instead built up 
their savings the government reported wednesday 
analysts were cautious about whether the report might signal the 
start of a longsought slowdown in consumer spending which would 
help cool inflationary pressures in the economy and said the robust 
income figures suggested continued strength in the economy 
on wall street stock prices slumped in late trading giving up 
an early gain under the pressure of renewed interestrate worries 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed with a 1535point 
loss at 224304 five stocks fell for every four that rose in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted issues 
bond prices fell sharply with activelytraded 30year issues 
losing 5 for every 1000 in face value 
but the dollar rose broadly in foreign exchange trading 
led by increases in wages and salaries reflecting strong 
employment gains income rose 74 billion to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 428 trillion in january the commerce department 
reported 
personal consumption spending meanwhile edged up just 01 
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 335 trillion the 
figure includes virtually all consumer spending except interest 
payments on debt 
at the same time americans added to their savings at an annual 
rate of 211 billion 
with the income gain strongly outpacing the rise in spending the 
personal savings rate rose to 58 percent from 43 percent in 
december it was the highest savings rate since may 1985 when 
americans set aside 65 percent of their disposable income 
analysts found the weak spending figure surprising in light of 
the strong income growth and were divided about whether it marked 
the start of a trend toward slower consumer spending 
jerry jasinowski chief economist for the national association of 
manufacturers said the figures were welcome news suggesting that 
fears of the economy overheating were unfounded 
but lea tyler senior economist for the wefa group a bala 
cynwyd pa forecasting firm said it was too early to talk about 
consumers really retrenching 
ms tyler said that if strong employment figures continue to 
drive income upward it could raise some concerns about inflation 
in the coming year 
the federal reserve board since last march has been pushing 
interest rates up in an effort to slow the economy and dampen 
inflationary pressures fed chairman alan greenspan has singled out 
higher wage pressures in the economy as part of the cause of 
accelerating inflation 
just last week the central bank boosted its key bank lending 
rate a halfpercentagepoint to 7 percent after worries about 
inflation were heightened by a report that consumer prices shot up 
06 percent in january 
consumer spending rose at a robust 35 percent annual rate last 
year a pace that analysts said is too fast given constraints on 
production caused by high operating rates and tight labor markets 
robert dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago said januarys income and spending report sent mixed 
signals with the strong income gain suggesting the economy was 
continuing to race ahead too fast while the spending pace 
suggests a much more restrained pattern that would be welcome 
sandra shaber of the futures group in washington said it was 
possible that januarys weak consumer spending figure may be one of 
the first signs that higher interest rates are taking their toll 
on consumer spending 
however ms shaber said the figures more likely signaled that 
people are better able to save after enjoying sustained 
increases in income over the last year 
in another report wednesday the commerce department said 
construction spending increased 04 percent in january led by a 
strong increase in work on nonresidential buildings and held back 
by a decrease in work on government projects 
building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
424 billion in january following a 21 percent increase in 
december and a 13 percent jump in november 
januarys increase in personal income was the biggest monthly 
increase since a 2 percent jump in october 1987 while the slim rise 
in spending was the weakest performance since a 15 percent decrease 
in september 
the increase in income was paced by a 12 percent gain in the key 
component of wages and salaries reflecting continued strong 
employment 
the recent income gains were bolstered by several unusual 
factors including a 41 percent pay raise in january for federal 
civilian and military personnel a 4 percent costofliving increase 
in social security benefits in january and a december increase in 
farm subsidy payments the commerce department said 
even excluding such factors however personal income still 
increased 16 percent in january and 08 percent in december 
americans disposable or aftertax incomes rose 17 percent in 
january after rising 09 percent in december and falling 03 percent 
in november

securities fraud and other criminal counts in an alleged scheme to 
manipulate the price of union carbide corp stock in october 1986 
us district judge mary johnson lowe denied defense motions to 
dismiss the charges made tuesday finding that the government has 
offered sufficient evidence 
the judge also denied a defense request to declare a mistrial for 
the second time lowe declared a mistrial jan 10 four weeks into 
the case because a prosecutor failed to disclose a report that 
concluded a major piece of evidence had been altered 
after a new jury was selected the second trial began feb 1 with 
opening arguments at federal court in manhattan 
legal and business observers consider the gaf trial significant 
because it is the first courtroom test of information stemming from 
the insider trading scandals that rocked wall street in the 
mid1980s 
gaf a wayne njbased chemicials and building materials 
manufacturer two subsidiaries and sherwin were accused of 
orchestrating a scheme to drive up the price of union carbide before 
unloading 5 million shares acquired during an unsuccessful takeover 
attempt 
the main prosecution witness was boyd l jefferies former head 
of a los angelesbased brokerage who struck a plea bargain with 
prosecutors after being implicated by master insider trader ivan 
boesky boesky who is serving a 3year prison sentence did not 
testify at the trial 
after a securities fraud count was dismissed tuesday at 
prosecutors request the defense sought to have the remaining eight 
counts of stock manipulation conspiracy securities fraud and wire 
fraud dismissed 
the defense held that the government hadnt offered proof of 
intent to induce investors to but stock they sought a mistrial on 
grounds that some of jefferies testimony which was contradicted by 
one of his associates was hearsay 
lowe denied the request however and defense lawyers for sherwin 
called three character witnesses including leo cherne a 
76yearold lawyer and official of the international rescue 
committee which assists political refugees 
cherne said sherwin 54 of princeton nj had served on the 
ircs executive committee since the early 1970s with extraordinary 
devotion and distinction 
the count dismissed tuesday concerned the sale of 5 million 
shares of carbide stock in november 1986 to salomon brothers inc 
the count was considered a complicating factor in an already complex 
case but assistant us attorney carl h lowenson jr declined to 
comment on why the government dropped the charge 
lowe said she expected to sequester the jury during their 
deliberations expected to begin late next week

the cold snap that heavily damaged northeast 
floridas potatoes and blighted other crops could drive up local 
vegetable prices and put a crimp in the nations potato chip supply 
this spring officials said tuesday 
the potato chip industry had been counting on an early and 
abundant supply of potatoes from this area this spring to replinish 
dwindling stocks said harold willingham southeastern area field 
manager for fritolay inc 
but now the freeze has turned what was expected to be a bonanza 
into a season of gloom for potato farmers 
as good as the crop was looking it would work out about right 
it was as much as three weeks early willingham said monday from 
his office in nearby hastings 
the 26000 acres of potatoes st johns putnam and flagler 
counties in northeast florida fill a niche in the supply of chip 
potatoes for a few weeks each spring because they come in earlier 
than other areas
